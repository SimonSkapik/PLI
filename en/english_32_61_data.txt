  ethics and integrity are essential in the world of sport and are topics that have continued to gain importance for fifa and the football community in recent years   these words  spoken by former federation internationale de football  fifa  president joseph  sepp  blatter in august of last year  ring somewhat hollow today  at the time  the international governing body for soccer that he then led was preparing to host the first ever world summit on ethics in sports in belgium   we therefore welcome the opportunity to host this special summit and look forward to a fruitful debate among international experts on these important topics   blatter continued  maybe he missed the conference  apparently  he either didn t listen to the international experts or he thought that what they had to say somehow didn t apply to his own organization  earlier this week  blatter announced that he would resign as president of fifa following the indictment by the united states government of several current and former fifa officials and sports marketing officials for bribery  fraud and money laundering  as devastating as the unfolding scandal has proven for blatter and fifa s reputation  there are valuable lessons to be learned  and professors at several leading business schools fully expect to use the fifa case to teach their mba students   the case will certainly be written for an mba program   says b  sebastian reiche  an assistant professor in the department of managing people at iese business school  whose research focuses on cross cultural management and global leadership  among other topics   many of the things that are playing out here could be a great case   echoes david mayer  associate professor of management and organization at the university of michigan s ross school of business  mayer  who is also faculty co director of the center for positive organizations at ross  notes that issues of cultural relativism  accountability and leadership in crisis that are central to the fifa scandal are all topics that come up in the classes he teaches on the intersection between ethics and leadership   now you ve got me thinking i should write a case on this   he says with a laugh   the basic lesson for mbas is that corruption will cause organizations to implode   says harvard business school  hbs  professor of management practice william w  george   must practice integrity all over the world   the former medtronic chairman and ceo stated in a twitter exchange with clear admit  a combination of factors contributed to fifa corruption many factors came together in the fifa case  creating a scenario ripe for bad behavior  for starters  there are very high incentives for misconduct where international soccer is concerned  indeed  the    count indictment from the u s  attorney s office unsealed last week alleged that      million in bribes changed hands between fifa officials and other parties for vote rigging to send events to certain countries or business to certain companies   there was a lot of money to be made and very little oversight   says mayer  add to that the fact that people in a competition mode who are high in power are more likely to engage in self interested behavior   i do think there was a bit of a perfect storm   mayer says  it s possible that some of the fifa officials and others involved may have even rationalized to themselves that they were helping countries who might not otherwise have had a shot at hosting international events like the world cup  he suggests   i think oftentimes it is important for all people to feel like they are a good person in some way   he says  viewing what they are doing as some type of good could potentially have licensed the unethical acts in some minds  he offers  the perception that bribery is part of the way business is done in certain regions of the world may also have something to do with how the corruption at fifa was justified by those involved and continued unchecked for as long as it did   believing that bribes are how business gets done other places is a form of morally disengaged thinking   mayer says  these kinds of rationalizations can and do affect people s behavior  he adds  some areas of life  such as family  religion and education  are more likely to be imbued with morality  mayer notes  sports and business  in contrast  are characterized by competition   clearly people do wonderful things in both  but that combination can create a bad synergy that can lead to bad behavior   he says  bribery benefits no one cindy schipani  a professor of business law at ross for more than    years  takes a starker view   this scandal is just another example of the high level greed that s involved in trying to get business in a way that is completely inappropriate and benefits no on but the greedy parties   she says  most tragic  she adds  are the human costs  in the case of countries that may have paid bribes to host world cup events  for instance  millions of dollars were wasted that should have been spent on services for their own citizens   there is never a benefit to paying a bribe   schipani says   you might get a contract in the immediate future  but the payments that go out are always much greater than the benefits that come in   she says  often  she adds  one bribe leads to another and another  schipani  who has conducted extensive research on bribery and corruption  says that a western notion that bribery is part of how business gets done in other parts of the world is harmful   it s just not true   she says   bribery is illegal all over the world  when it takes place  it is always under the table  it is always hidden that tells you something right there   lessons from fifa for mba students schipani hopes to drive home to her mba students that clean business is better business   what i worry about with my mbas is that they could go out into the world thinking   if i just pay this little extra then i ll get this contract and it will benefit the company  it will benefit the shareholders    in fact  the opposite is true  she says   it never benefits the shareholders  because bribery means that companies are spending money they shouldn t be spending   in the case of german engineering giant siemens  which was embroiled in a corruption scandal and paid a      billion fine for bribery in       the company is much more profitable today by operating clean  schipani says   it is just a fallacy in thinking that bribery is good for business or good for the company  it s not   thinking that it is okay in other countries is another fallacy  she adds   i will dissect this particular scandal as it unfolds as another example of how corruption doesn t benefit business   mayer  for his part  envisions using the fifa case as an opportunity to encourage his students to imagine ethical questions they themselves may encounter  doing so will probably involve presenting a range of conceivable scenarios  he says  for example  he could see himself saying to students   maybe no one in this room would take    million dollars in a bribe  but what might be something you would be tempted to do    put this way  i think my students could relate to the idea of feeling pressure   he says  be it feeling like they could lose their job if they didn t do something to win a given contract or be it feeling pressure to protect their family  classroom discussion will also likely lead to the challenges an organization faces when there is an ethical scandal  mayer continues   how does an organization respond  can you keep the same leadership  does a leader have to go  what kinds of things can you do to renew faith   fifa s future fate in the case of fifa  mayer and schipani both suspect the organization will rebound   they are going to take a hit  but i suspect that they will recover from it  especially if they make a commitment to seriously clean up  making sure that the parties that have touched this scandal in anyway are gone and putting in monitoring efforts to show that they are really cleaning up   says schipani  mayer was not surprised to see blatter step down  but he was surprised at how quickly it happened  he suspects that the threat of corporate sponsors pulling out may have contributed   ousting blatter seemed like a necessary but not sufficient condition   he says   bringing in a leader who is removed from the scandal  who is untarnished and who has a reputation for high integrity will be really important now   he says  he also suspects that many more fifa officials may need to go  of course  many of the factors that led to the corruption in the first place will remain   there will always be money and the incentives will always be high  but if there is more of an ethical culture and more oversight of the people involved  my intuition is that it will rebound   mayer says   ultimately the product is so good    he says   people love soccer  and they are motivated to want to get to see soccer and see institutions that support soccer on positive terms   he says   i really see them recovering   recent events certainly highlight the need for a world summit on ethics in sports  perhaps  though  an organization other than fifa would be better suited to host the second annual gathering  resolving to better train business leaders to take on the environmental and human challenges facing the world  new york university  nyu  stern school of business today announced that it will ring in      by launching a new center for sustainability business  environmental activist and steward tensie whelan  currently the president of the rainforest alliance  will join the stern faculty to establish and lead the new center in january       whelan  who earned her bachelor s degree from nyu in       returns to her alma mater with more than    years of experience confronting environmental and sustainability issues at the local  national and international level  she helped grow the rainforest alliance s budget from      million to     million  recruiting       companies in more than    countries to transform their engagement with sustainability through partnership with the organization   what s remarkable about tensie is not only her courage and conviction to imagine a world in which profit and principle can co exist  but also her skill and will to transform that vision into action   nyu stern dean peter henry said in a statement  at the rainforest alliance  whelan partnered closely with sustainability leaders from multinationals  as well as with global ceos  key ngo and united nations leaders and funders  this type of collaboration helped lead an evolution over the past decade from businesses confronting environmental problems and unsustainable development largely due to reputational and supply chain challenges to those same organizations proactively mainstreaming sustainability into their business operations  noting that stern encourages its students to use the tools of business to tackle some of the world s greatest problems  dean henry called whelan  the ideal role model to lead by example on issues that are critical to long term prosperity and economic growth   under whelan s leadership  the new center for sustainable business will offer sustainability courses at the undergraduate  graduate and executive education level  with an emphasis on real world experiential learning  to create the center s programming  whelan will partner with faculty at stern and across nyu  as well as with leading practitioners from the business  nonprofit and government sectors  the center will also host conferences and other forums convening groups of companies from different sectors and parts of the world with stakeholders and experts to explore solutions for a major environment and development challenges  whelan  for her part  expressed excitement about returning to nyu in this new role   stern puts a premium on value creation for business as well as society  a philosophy that matches my own   she said in a statement   coupled with its prime location in new york  home to the financial sector  silicon alley  the un and ngos  stern has an unprecedented opportunity to drive this conversation   in addition to her leadership of the rainforest alliance  whelan also serves on the advisory boards of social accountability

the new center for sustainable business    an alumnus of the harvard business school  hbs  today made the largest gift in harvard university s history a      million endowment that will support the school of engineering and applied sciences  seas   the gift  from billionaire hedge fund manager john a  paulson  mba       will help fund seas s planned expansion across the river from cambridge to allston  where its scientists and engineers will occupy research and teaching facilities adjacent to hbs and the harvard innovation lab  i lab    john paulson s extraordinary gift will enable the growth and ensure the strength of engineering and applied sciences at harvard for the benefit of generations to come   harvard university president drew faust said in a statement   his appreciation of the importance of seas to faculty  students  and schools across the university has motivated a historic act of generosity that will change harvard and enhance our impact on the world beyond   after graduating from hbs  the queens born paulson worked briefly for boston consulting group and then for multiple wall street investment firms before founding his own hedge fund  paulson   co   in      with    million and one employee  the firm  which specializes in alternative investments  now manages       billion of money for wealthy individuals and pension funds  paulson expressed his appreciation for the benefits his hbs education has afforded him  even as he gave the unprecedented gift to seas   seas is the next frontier for harvard  and its expanding campus in allston promises to become the next major center of innovation   he said in a statement  in recognition of his gift  the engineering school will be renamed the harvard john a  paulson school of engineering and applied sciences  hbs dean nitin nohria praised paulson s generosity and the future it paves   he understands that this gift will be the cornerstone for a harvard campus in allston where multiple disciplines can converge and combine their passion for knowledge  unleashing discovery in ways that truly benefit society and the world   he said in a statement  paulson s gift comes in the midst of a      billion university wide fundraising campaign launched by harvard in       even with its own endowment topping      billion  hbs set a goal of raising an additional    billion as part of the fundraising campaign  to support financial aid  faculty research  globalization  curricular innovation and enhancements to the school s residential campus  as of the end of fiscal year       hbs reported that it had raised more than      million toward that goal  speaking last week at london business school  lbs   his royal highness  hrh  the prince of wales challenged current and future mba students to demand an education that will prepare them to lead the world toward greater sustainability   to all those current business school students   and to those who are deciding where to study   ask yourself  is your chosen business school really going to equip you to be the kind of leader that is so badly needed for the next    years  nothing less will do   prince charles said  lbs hosted the may   th event  which was convened by the prince s accounting for sustainability project  a s  and the university of cambridge institute for sustainability leadership  cisl   speaking to an assembled audience that included deans and leading academics from business schools from around the world  hrh conceded that some progress has been made in the past two decades in terms of incorporating sustainability into mainstream accounting and finance research and teaching within business schools  for starters  he offered  the cisl that he himself founded    years ago has helped train almost       business leaders on how to find convergence between profitability and sustainability   it is clear that new and important research is emerging from many quarters  including that relating directly to finance and accounting   he said   and it is good to hear that the m b a  programme has developed considerably to meet the widening demands and requirements of future business leaders   he added  but too often  he continued  specializations on sustainability are being offered as optional electives or as part of ethics classes  rather than being embedded into core curriculum courses   is all this enough   the prince asked of those in attendance   and why on earth is it taking so long to get the message through   business schools have a responsibility to tap the minds of their students and encourage innovation  creativity and greater understanding as it relates to sustainability  hrh challenged  the concepts of environmental limits and the enhancement of community capital should come up again and again in classes devoted to finance  accounting  marketing  corporate strategy and manufacturing  key words such as population  poverty  climate change  ecosystems and biodiversity  human rights  africa  mega cities  and the empowerment of women should appear regularly in lectures and academic publications  and up and coming academics should be rewarded for doing work related to ethics  sustainability and society  he argued   in short  are your business schools really in touch with the issues that will increasingly have an impact on the future viability of businesses  or should wise and forward thinking companies be looking elsewhere to develop their executives for the future   he asked  business schools have a very special role to play  the prince continued   society needs to be able to look to you with confidence for some of the best thinking and the most enlightened education  to secure the future for our children and our children s children   lbs  for its part  is already on board  according to its dean   i very much support the call to incorporate sustainability in the business school agenda   dean sir andrew likierman said in a statement   indeed  the issues are already taught as part of the core curriculum in many of our programmes   as an example  he cited the school s business  government and society core course  in which students examine how businesses can best balance the drive to make profit with the needs of society   this is not only because we see their importance  but as a response to the keen interest of our students   likierman added  student interest in sustainability is also reflected in the rapid growth in recent years of the lbs net impact chapter  which presented its      society economy environment summit  s e e summit  the same day as prince charles s visit to the school  the student led energy club is also very active on campus  organizing events such as the annual global energy summit and clean tech challenge  for any of the strides lbs may be making within the classroom or as part of club activities  it would be foolhardy for it or any other business school to profess to have a solution to the sustainability challenges that face the world today  says ioannis ioannou  lbs assistant professor of strategy and entrepreneurship   while there isn t a comprehensive set of best practices that business schools can confidently prescribe  what we can do is to be actively involved in an exciting series of experiments and active learning with the business community  and its stakeholders   he said in a statement   sustainability has to be discovered  the role of business education therefore  for now  isn t to teach best practice  it is rather to provide a structured understanding of the challenges  establish the parameters of possible solutions and accordingly drive curiosity  collaboration and adaptability   read the entire speech delivered by hrh prince of wales  learn more about lbs s sustainability initiatives  one month from today  dartmouth s tuck school of business will officially welcome its new dean as professor matthew slaughter succeeds    year veteran of the post dean paul danos  talk about big shoes to fill  dartmouth president phil hanlon called danos  everything any institution could want in a business school dean   and more than    alumni and friends contributed to a     million endowment to name the deanship in his honor  supporting in perpetuity all who come after him  in a wide ranging interview published recently by the dartmouth office of public affairs  soon to be dean slaughter talks about what it s like to follow in danos s footsteps  what he thinks prepares him for the challenge and more  his life work to inform his role as dean an international economist  slaughter has spent years studying and teaching how globalization  technological change and public policy shape the performance of companies  industries and labor markets  these very same forces have likewise shaped graduate management education  he notes  as evidenced by the growing interest in business education in emerging markets  the ways technology is changing how ideas are delivered and the expanded scrutiny of education in the united states and elsewhere   forces such as these make it a very exciting time for those of us in education   he says   the work i have done throughout my academic and professional career will hopefully inform the thinking and activities we do here at tuck   he adds  in addition to his scholarship and tenure since      as a professor of management and associate dean for faculty at tuck  slaughter served on president george w  bush s council of economic advisors from      to      and has regularly worked with business and government leaders in washington on financial regulation  international trade  international tax and immigration   this experience has enriched my teaching  my research and all other aspects of my professional life at tuck   he says  a tough act to follow                                        as for succeeding dean danos  slaughter appreciates the enormity of the legacy he has inherited   paul transformed the tuck school from a very good institution to in aspiration and  in many ways  in actuality a world class institution   he says  danos increased the range and impact of the school s programs  centers and initiatives  grew the number of full time faculty from    to     and helped raise the school s standing in global rankings  slaughter also appreciates his own good fortune in having danos as a leader   on a personal level  i will always be eternally indebted to paul for all the big and little things he taught me  in formal and informal ways first as a faculty member and then when i had the good fortune to serve with him in the dean s office   he says   excited to help foster values driven leadership in the wake of the financial crisis  the integrity of business leaders has been called into question  slaughter notes  more than anything else  he is excited to help create values driven leaders    at a time when so many are yearning for that rare kind of leadership  the chance to help lead tuck to address those needs is very exciting   he says  and he plans to dive in by talking to people throughout the institution  though he has been at tuck for years  he astutely recognizes that there is still lots he needs to learn about the school   research shows quite clearly that when ascending into new leadership positions  people tend to succeed more when they view learning as integral to their leadership  learning from and teaching to others to help create visions of where an organization can go  why it should go in that direction and the exciting gains that result from going there   he says  don t fix what s not broken even as he researches and prepares for the ways in which tuck may need to change direction under his leadership  slaughter also recognizes enduring strengths that should not change  such as the school s commitment to quality  deep belief in the integrity of leaders and focus on experiential learning  unparalleled teaching also sets tuck apart  he notes   part of what distinguishes us is the way we bring the knowledge creation of our faculty and the experience of our alumni into the classroom in a rigorous and relevant way   he says   we do a terrific job at tuck connecting the value of scholarship with the teaching endeavor   on a lighter note  slaughter also shared that his fantasy is to be reincarnated as a successful pga golfer  not the mediocre golfer he is today  last but not least  he confessed that he is a family man   one other thing everyone should know is that as much as i love my work and love the tuck school  far and away the most important thing to me is my family   he says  his wife  two sons  two dogs and extended family matter more to him than anything else in the world  read the complete interview with incoming tuck dean matthew slaughter  forget crimson  the stoles and tassels worn by harvard business school  hbs  graduates today may have been deep red  but the school was going for green in its commencement exercises this year  as part of the day s events as well as those of class day yesterday and reunion tomorrow hbs graduates  alumni and guests will take part in a coordinated composting effort unlike any in the school s history  for the first time ever  the back to back celebrations this week at hbs will feature completely compostable lunch containers and utensils  which attendees will sort into designated bins for recycling  composting and trash  and because it can sometimes be hard to determine which items go into which bins especially for novice environmentalists hbs green team volunteers will staff each of the    sorting stations to help people know what s what  the environmentally conscious measures culminate five months of hard work and logistical scheming by the hbs sustainability team  led by allison webster and leah ricci   the advanced planning we put in place has helped us get well ahead of the game   says webster  who works for harvard s office for sustainability  ofs  as the hbs sustainability program manager  since joining hbs in november       webster has been helping reduce the school s impact on the environment through a range of sustainability efforts  she also oversees the mba student sustainability associates  ssa  program  which this year hired    first year hbs students to contribute to ongoing initiatives  complete sustainability focused independent projects and help educate fellow classmates on how to get involved in efforts to make the school greener  ricci  assistant director of sustainability and energy management  joined the hbs sustainability team in september       reporting to the school s facilities director  she leads and administers the hbs sustainability program  with a focus on conserving energy  reducing waste  instituting best practices and educating the community on behavioral changes that can positively impact the environment  since january  the two have been leading the charge toward making this week s events more sustainable  coordinating not only with the student ssas  but also with the employee based green team  hbs operations staff  restaurant associates  and the mba and alumni   external relations offices  thirty two green team members volunteered their time to serve as guides at each of the waste sorting stations  covering    shifts throughout the day   there are a lot of logistics behind the scenes that go into this   ricci explains in an interview with clear admit  indeed  it has involved everything from coordinating with restaurant associates  the group that caters hbs events  to source compostable containers and utensils to gaining buy in from the custodial team  which will need to collect an additional set of bins as a result of the sorting efforts   everyone has been really willing to work together to make this happen   webster adds  learning and educating along the way the week s successes are also the result of learning from prior events at hbs  as well as recognizing and incorporating best practices from other schools within the university and organizations outside of it  ricci snaps pictures of effective composting signage wherever she goes   i m always sending pictures to allison saying   look at this cool sign i saw    most recently  she spotted inspiration at a local hospital when visiting a friend  the duo also takes notes from other harvard schools that have implemented composting practices  they learned from the harvard divinity school  for example  that there are advantages to lining up the bins in order of importance from left to right  compost  recycle  trash  looking back at last year s commencement exercises  they also realized that the successful introduction of composting this year hinged on having as many compostable containers and other materials as possible   last year  there were too many elements that were too confusing   ricci says  so she and restaurant associates worked together to track down compostable options  even managing to find ones that didn t drive up the cost   we worried there would be a big price increase  but at the end of the day it was a wash   ricci says  water bottles were the only thing they weren t able to source in compostable form this year  in part because of supply chain issues  ricci devoted countless calls to trying to track down a solution  just in the past couple of weeks  they have identified a water filtration system that could be attached to a water source  enabling people to fill compostable cups from a fountain  unfortunately  that discovery came too late to be implemented this year   that s our dream for next year   says webster  although she has even higher hopes for the future   if we could totally eliminate trash bins one day  that would be amazing   she says   to just have a compost bin and a recycling bin would be great   small changes contribute to big picture goals  when you look at it holistically  this is not just about us adding compost on commencement   ricci says   it really all ties back into a larger effort   indeed  harvard university has set a goal of reducing waste per capita by    percent by       from a      baseline   already  through a focus on operating healthier  more energy efficient buildings  hbs has reduced emissions on its campus by    percent and cut energy use by    percent  it has also implemented single stream recycling  composting in dining halls  reuse collection stations during move out and donation of leftover food to local shelters and food banks  these initiatives  together with increased awareness through peer to peer education programs  such as those led by the ssas  have helped hbs achieved a    percent recycling rate  up from    percent last year and significantly exceeding the university wide rate of    percent  the sustainability team will continue to learn from its successes and refine its efforts  webster and ricci hope to expand the use of sorting stations to other large scale events on campus and to introduce more composting in dining halls and dorms  among other goals  the team also collaborates regularly with the hbs business   environment initiative  bei   a faculty and research division devoted to deepening business leaders  understanding of sustainability challenges and solutions through research  curriculum innovation  conferences  seminars and outreach   we take the sustainability challenge put forth by the university very seriously and are excited to continue initiatives like this to help us meet those goals   webster says  learn more about the hbs sustainability program here  columbia business school  cbs  kicked off the application cycle for the class of       sending its application live in late april  before any other leading business school  though this year s essay questions aren t hugely different from last year s  the school s admissions director took time to share her perspective on the subtle changes with clear admit and offer some guidance to applicants who may be preparing to embark upon the application process  speaking to clear admit yesterday  admissions director amanda carlson turned first to the school s first essay prompt the  career goals why a columbia mba now  question   through your resume and recommendations  we have a clear sense of your professional path to date  what are your career goals going forward  and how will the columbia mba help you achieve them   like last year  applicants this year are given     words to map out their career goals and explain how a columbia mba fits into achieving them  a slight modification to the first sentence  though  suggests that applicants leave out any synopsis of their work history to date  as carlson herself points out  her team has included a career goals why mba question or some variation thereof at least since she joined in      and likely longer  it s important enough to appear again and again not only because it gives the admissions committee useful insight into what the applicant hopes to get out of business school  but also because it forces candidates to really think about their goals long and hard before they arrive on campus  like sand in an hour glass depending on which program they enroll in cbs features an accelerated program that begins in january  as well as its regular full time mba students at columbia are in school for    to    months  in talking to prospective applicants  carlson likens that time to sand in an hourglass   as soon as you turn that hourglass over  your time is limited and it runs out really quickly   she cautions  columbia s location in new york city and all of the extra opportunities that affords only amplifies the effect  this first essay prompt is designed to help make sure students are focused and can maximize all that business school in general  and columbia in particular  has to offer   if students come and haven t narrowed what they want to focus on  they may miss many of the opportunities here at their fingertips   she says   we feel responsible and want to ensure that candidates are super prepared when they walk into uris hall   candidates considering a range of careers what if you re considering more than one potential career path   it is completely fair for candidates to say they may be exploring a few options   carlson says  the application actually provides two places for candidates to get at this answer  beginning with the short answer question that invites them to share their immediate post mba career goal   for this one we clearly want people to be concise and focused   carlson notes  indeed  since the form field will only allow submissions of    characters or fewer  the career goals essay  in contrast  offers candidates a full     words to describe how their short  and long term goals fit together  and why columbia is uniquely suited to helping them achieve those goals   if someone wants to add a little bit of color and explanation  this is the place to do it   carlson says  in other words  you can hint at more than one potential career path  but to stay within the word count and tell a compelling story while also focusing enough in advance to make the most of your limited time at school you ll do well to narrow things down from the very start   no one at graduation checks the admissions essay  of course  there will still be time to refine your chosen career path after application essays are a distant memory   no one at graduation checks the admissions essay to say   you said you would do x  y or z    carlson reassures   it s natural to be inspired by a professor  by your classmates  by the experiences you have in business school   she continues  that s part of the reason for going to business school  after all  as part of its second essay  carlson and her team want to know how a candidate will take advantage of columbia s location  at the very center of business   more than that  they want candidates to provide examples of how they will seize the unique opportunities the school presents such as its master classes  internships  new york immersion seminars and access to world renowned faculty and practitioners to bridge theory and practice  answering this question fully requires in depth knowledge of the school s unique offerings  so  what s the best way of obtaining this knowledge  is it through visiting campus  talking to current students  sitting in on a class   all of the above  of course   carlson responds cheerfully  fortunately  she follows up with some specifics   we have a group of students called the hermes society who volunteer their time to speak with prospective applicants about columbia   she offers as a first step  noting that contact information is readily available on the cbs website   that s a great way to reach current students and learn what their experiences have been   also  since columbia s j term students take classes for    months straight beginning in january  class visits are available even during the summer months   we find that it s a really nice benefit for prospective students to have that opportunity over the summer   carlson says  for applicants who are specifically interested in learning more about the unique j term program  carlson and team will host a special event on july   th called  spotlight on january   as part of a robust day of programming  participants will learn just what the j term entails  as well as how it can be a really good choice for someone who is company sponsored  part of a family business or looking to make a slight change in their career  for example  if you can t visit acknowledging that some applicants simply can t make the trip to new york to visit the cbs campus in person  carlson s team has hosted dozens of webinars in the past year  some with an academic focus  others spotlighting leadership opportunities or other aspects of the school s community  she hopes for even more in the year ahead  lastly  the team is finalizing its summer and fall recruiting plans and will soon post dates and locations in the united states and internationally where prospective applicant can meet the admissions staff and learn more about the school   any and all of those ways would be really helpful in terms of helping folks learn a little more about what student life is like at columbia and how they can take advantage of  being at the very center of business    carlson says   cbs matters   i am so excited to talk about this   carlson says of essay    this essay prompt builds on a question columbia has been asking for the past couple of years one that invites candidates to share something about themselves they think will be pleasantly surprising to their future clustermates  in fact  an entire program has grown up around the very practice of cbs students sharing little known aspects of who they are with fellow cbs students  called cbs matters  the program was founded a few years ago by one of the school s alumni  and now it has become an institution in and of itself  carlson says  this year  the essay prompt includes a link to a video showcasing the program  in which current students share a story or stories about themselves with their fellow classmates  the program is voluntary  but most students choose to participate  says carlson  sharing their thoughts  aspects of their background  really whatever matters most to them  in a somewhat public forum   cbs matters presentations can be delivered to a student s cluster or to the entire school    this program has been incredible in helping students foster deeper relationships   carlson says   and when they get to learn about what really drives people what motivates them most very often classmates want to help   she says   cbs matters really creates bonds that last longer than just the two years students spend here   by interweaving the cbs matters program into the actual essay question this year  carlson and team hope to help prospective applicants move beyond a merely hypothetical question and envision themselves actually delivering their own cbs matters one day  in terms of what to choose  carlson encourages prospective applicants  if they want  to take this opportunity to share something personal that doesn t necessarily relate to their career goals  beyond that  to gauge the effectiveness of a topic you are considering  she suggests trying it out on two audiences  one person who knows you very well and one person who doesn t know you at all  if it speaks to them both  that s a good sign  is imitation the highest form of flattery  we mentioned that there are some similarities between columbia s essay   and harvard business school s newest essay question  revealed earlier this month  in which applicants are invited to introduce themselves to the members of their future section  carlson was surprised to hear it and seemed quite sure that any overlap was unintentional  overlap  though  is not surprising  given that schools are looking for similar traits in candidates  she adds   at columbia  we ask this question because it is just such a great opportunity to get to know more about something that doesn t relate to the candidate s professional goals   parting advice  have fun with it   carlson says when asked for one last piece of advice she d give to candidates before sitting down to write their essays   i really encourage them to look at this as a  glass is half full  process in other words  we are looking for reasons to admit people  not the other way around   tomorrow  the i lab incubator at the university of virginia  uva  s darden school of business will kick off its

outclass was honored by dean peter henry at an awards ceremony last night for her leadership and contributions to the school s community  thanks to the efforts of hurnyak and other sternies  the new york city business school this year introduced numerous initiatives emphasizing diversity and inclusion part of the school s commitment to promoting  eq   emotional quotient  as an integral value within graduate management education   i wanted to come to nyu stern because to me it represented the type of school that would be the best and brightest in terms of diversity and inclusion   hurnyak said in an early morning interview with clear admit yesterday before heading off to yankee stadium for nyu s school wide graduation ceremony   she did not yet know about the award she would receive later that night   hurnyak  who identifies as a member of the lgbtq community  was less drawn by the school s proximity to wall street and its investment banks and more by its location within the village  where the lgbtq civil rights movement began in the     s  she says  when she arrived  though  she found that there was still room for improvement in terms of making the school a more diverse and inclusive place where everyone regardless of sexual orientation  race  class or gender could feel safe and supported  rather than waiting for something to happen organically or one person leading the charge for change  several groups including outclass  the association of hispanic and black business students and stern women in business worked collaboratively to champion greater diversity and inclusion school wide  hurnyak says   together  we succeeded at getting stern to a much better place   expanding allyship to all as an example  stern this year expanded  allyship  a concept promoted within the lgbtq community of inviting straight peers to serve as allies to lgbtq community members to be inclusive of all community members  a first among business schools  as part of ally week in april  a full    percent of the student body signed the ally pledge  promising to serve as allies to one another   the ally pledge historically has been lgbtq specific   says hurnyak   we changed it so that it includes all people and calls for a promise to respect everyone  making stern a safe space for everyone    one of my favorite moments as a human  current events and a forum called  stern speaks   in which stern mba students share their life stories with their classmates  also helped unite the student body for path changing discussions  hurnyak says  in the wake of the michael brown and eric garner cases that rocked the country      stern students gathered on a thursday night in december to hear three of their african american classmates speak  another stern student  in a blog entry for the financial times in january  recounted the event   those of us who attended had the privilege of hearing three brave classmates share their stories  all of which included personal encounters with both individual and institutional racism   wrote victoria michelotti   when the floor opened to the audience  people mustered the courage to ask uncomfortable questions  honest and sometimes painful answers were given in reply  a dialogue had begun   that discussion which was moderated by nyu stern professor dolly chugh  an expert on unconscious bias is when stern students really put everything on the table   it was the first time organically our community said   we are at a fork in the road and we have to choose between discussing the difficult topic and avoiding it   hurnyak recalls   it is one of my favorite moments as a human   she says  dean s recognition last night  dean henry presented hurnyak with her award at the academic awards and service recognition reception  the prestigious service award was established by stern alumni to recognize a graduating mba with extraordinary service and contribution to the school and the university as a whole  hurnyak s classmates chose her as the recipient  today  during his convocation remarks at stern s graduation ceremony  henry addressed the assembled graduates about leadership and community at stern including the school s emphasis on eq  he noted with pride initiatives such as stern speaks  the cross collaboration of different clubs to strengthen the stern community during ally week and the    percent student participation in the ally pledge  he also again praised hurnyak s contributions to helping the stern community become more inclusive and diverse  hurnyak  for her part  seems more comfortable talking about what stern has given her than what she has given stern   i often find in the lgbtq community that lesbians and gay men forget that we need to be allies to our bisexual colleagues and our transgender colleagues   she says   the diversity trainings that we received this year will help me be a better ally to members of my own community  which sometimes people are shocked to hear is necessary   as part of ally week  a gender neutral restroom was instituted and opened on each floor of the stern school  going well beyond a student initiated request for a single restroom in the building  her time at stern has clearly also made hurnyak a greater ally to classmates outside of the lgbtq community   now i am ready to dive into racial equality issues   she says  even amid triumphs with regard to marriage equality  recent events in baltimore have made it impossible to ignore enduring racial inequality  she says   this year really taught me personally that these issues are not exclusive of one another they all relate to one another   she says   progress in the lgbtq community feels great  but i still can t celebrate fully when we are taking steps backward nationally with regard to race or gender   hurnyak s growth and that of her classmates bodes well for business in general  she suggests   the single greatest achievement during my time at stern has been helping our peers practice talking about difficult topics topics surrounding race and gender and transgender issues  sexuality  socioeconomic status   she says   to me that is an achievement because these sternies will take those skills with them to their workplaces and their internships  and that will have a ripple effect for the rest of their careers   as these sternies head out into the world  they will be able to leverage the kind of mindset that stern helped them embrace   as they make their business decisions  as they engage with their employees they will make their companies more inclusive and diverse places  which will positively benefit those businesses and society as a whole   she says   i call that a  win win      the indian school of business  isb  earlier this week shared details

states and around the globe have more to celebrate than simply turning tassels  results from a corporate recruiters  survey released today show  indeed  employer demand for recent business school graduates tops all previous years  according to the      corporate recruiters survey  conducted by the graduate management admissions council  gmac  in partnership with efmd and the mba career services   employer alliance  mba csea   an astounding    percent of u s  employers surveyed report plans to hire mba grads this year  up    percent over last year  globally  numbers are also robust  if not quite as strong as the u s  figures  some    percent of employers worldwide expect to add new mbas to their workforce this year  up from    percent in      and just    percent in       this bests the prior all time high of    percent in          the mba  as an area of study valued by employers  is showing more strength than ever with hiring of new graduates projected to rise for the third year in a row   sangeet chowfla  gmac president and ceo  said in a statement   students of any undergraduate background would do well to consider taking a graduate management degree because of the contributions it can make to their career aspirations   up  up and up not only do more employers plan to hire mbas this year  they plan to hire more of them and pay them higher starting salaries  almost two thirds of companies plan to increase the number of mba grads they will hire  and more than half of employers will bump up starting salaries for those new hires  the survey found   this is great news for students and portends well for the economy overall   mba csea president damian zikakis  who also leads career services at the university of michigan s ross school of business  said in a statement   it is encouraging to know companies are so confident in their growth prospects   the projected median starting salary this year for recent mba grads in the united states is           a   percent gain over last year and almost twice the expected starting salary for recent bachelor s degree graduates            of course  employers also expect mba graduates to have clocked an average of two to four years of work experience between college and business school  contributing to the near doubled salary  europe trails in mba hiring growth mba graduates seeking jobs in europe have less cause for celebration than those targeting employers elsewhere around the world  while more than half of companies based in europe     percent  report plans to hire mbas this year  that s up only slightly from    percent in       and considerably lower than the nine in    u s  employers actively recruiting mba grads  in latin america and asia  meanwhile  growth is projected to be stronger than in europe  seventy five percent of latin american and asian companies surveyed plan to hire mbas in       up from    percent in each region in       one trend revealed by gmac s latest research into corporate recruiting plans is notable growth in the demand for data analytics  more than half     percent  of all companies surveyed globally indicated plans to hire for this job function in       up from    percent last year  asked to list three skills they were looking for in mba grads this year  more employers said analytics than anything else  as for how they pick which mba candidates to interview for available positions  employers were of remarkably similar minds  nine out of    cited demonstrated track record  strong communications skills and solid technical or quantitative skills as their top three selection criteria  for the first time this year  the survey also gauged employers  impressions of massive open online course  moocs   the findings  only    percent of companies

term expires next year  she announced in memos to the school s students and staff today  one of just nine female deans leading a top tier business school in the united states  davis blake said she hopes to focus on  the broader problems and opportunities facing universities   appointed in july      by former president mary sue coleman and former provost phil hanlon  davis blake came to ross from the university of minnesota s carlson school of management  where she also served as dean   during the past decade  i have learned that i particularly enjoy working with faculty  staff and students to stabilize challenging situations and then create momentum towards extraordinary positive performance   she wrote in an email to the ross staff   together  we have created that momentum at the ross school   during her tenure  she helped launch a capital campaign that has raised more than      million  including increasing donations by    percent each year  she noted in her email  she also cited the role she played in helping to strengthen the faculty and doctoral program and in increasing the school s global footprint  according to the school s website  she helped hire    tenure track faculty members and    lecturers  representing a full    percent of the current teaching faculty at the school  she is also credited with increasing international learning opportunities for students by    percent and for forming    new partnerships with universities around the world   i am proud of the work we have done together to secure the ross school s position as one of the best business schools in the world   she wrote  her decision to announce her departure a full year before stepping down is both to give the school ample time to identify a successor and to not jeopardize the ongoing capital campaign  she says   it is very difficult to look  prospective  donors in the eye and ask them to invest in the university and you when you have one foot out the door   she told the financial times   this is much fairer   davis blake will leave ross once her term expires on june           harvard business school  hbs  wants to help the world understand gender related matters as never before so today it launched a brand new gender initiative designed to promote gender equity in the business world and society as a whole   harvard business school and its faculty have been leaders in defining the roles and functions of business  as well as effective business practice   dean nitin nohria said in a statement   with the launch of this initiative  we want to have a similar and lasting impact on the way the world understands and acts upon gender related matters   hbs senior associate dean for culture and community robin ely will lead the new initiative  which will have as its main goal to provide rigorous research to ground discussions about gender  helping people make better informed decisions as they relate to themselves  their families  their companies and their communities  she said  case in point  research released friday by hbs professor kathleen mcginn providing evidence of advantages for children of working mothers  mcginn  together with mayra ruiz castro  a researcher at hbs  and elizabeth long lingo of mt  holyoke college  studied        adults in    countries  they found that in    out of    countries studied  the daughters of working mothers completed more years of education  had higher rates of employment and were more likely both to supervise others and earn higher incomes than those of moms who stayed at home  sons of working moms  while their careers were not measurably impacted  were found to contribute more time each week to childcare and housework which research has shown to increase women s involvement in the workforce and perhaps impact the stability of marriages   there are very few things  that we know of  that have such a clear effect on gender inequality as being raised by a working mother   mcginn said in a statement  the study was conducted as part of the new gender initiative  its findings help counter still prevalent perceptions that the increase in working moms is bad for society   a times article friday cited a pew research study in which    percent of adults had that view  compared to only    percent who saw more working moms as a positive   this is precisely the role hbs hopes the new initiative and its research will play   so much of what people think they know about gender is simply not substantiated by empirical evidence but instead is based on gender stereotypes   ely said in a statement   we want to develop the initiative so that harvard business school becomes the  go to place  on gender issues  where both researchers and practitioners can come together to find ways to advance gender equity in the workplace and help both women and men lead whole  fulfilled and sustainable lives   in addition to supporting such research and related case studies  course development and conferences the gender initiative s mission includes spotlighting the intersection between gender and other axes of inequality and expanding women s opportunities to lead and  challenge discrimination  stereotypes  implicit biases and power disparities  that limit both men s and women s ability to thrive   according to a press release  further  hbs hopes to support collaboration among hbs faculty and other scholars and practitioners interested in issues of gender and to cultivate a community of business leaders who are committed to advancing women and promoting gender equity  nohria  appointed in      by drew gilpin faust  harvard s first ever female president  has pledged since joining the business school to help redefine gender relations on campus  in september       a front page new york times article outlined efforts he had led for the prior two years to foster greater success among its female mba students through changes to the school s curriculum  rules and social rituals  in january       nohria promised to increase the number of female protagonists in hbs case studies from   to    percent by       learn more about the new hbs gender initiative  an applied finance and economics professor at johns hopkins university who  guarantees  the undergrads who take his class their top choice jobs on wall street when they graduate advises those students to skip the mba and obtain their chartered financial analyst  cfa  credentials instead  at clear admit  we re crying foul  hopkins professor james hanke  in an interview with business insider  said he doesn t think that mba programs are worthwhile  cfa credentials  he argued  are  more rigorous  and  much better   hanke has been trading currencies and commodities for more than    years and runs his own wealth management firm  still  we think his comparison of a specialized technical certification with a broader education in all things management is absurd   the cfa is basically a test of finance and accounting with a focus on how finance and accounting is used in the banking industry   clear admit co founder eliot ingram says   meaning  the cfa is really only relevant for people seeking certain jobs in the finance industry   the mba  in contrast  offers a broader business education as well as a valuable brand and network  make no mistake  the cfa has value  a lot of mbas in finance take the exam because it is a good credential to have in finance  ingram notes   it does demonstrate a level of mastery of the material much like passing the bar exam after law school   he says  having said that  prospective applicants to business schools should understand how admissions offices at leading mba programs view cfa and certified public accountant  cpa  credentials  these credentials are not considered  academic  measures like an applicant s gmat or gpa  says ingram   in reality  the completion of the cfa cpa exams is more of a professional credential and is not a substitute for grades and standardized testing   he says  while we are happy for hanke s students who have landed entry level analyst positions on wall street  we stand by our belief in the intrinsic value of the mba and caution those who would heed hanke s advice and mistakenly believe that cfa credentials provide an adequate substitute for the broad based management education provided by leading business schools  the ucla anderson school of management yesterday announced the biggest financial gift in the school s history  the      million gift comes from marion anderson  the widow of the management school s namesake  billionaire businessman and ucla alumnus john anderson      million of the gift will go toward establishing an endowment for financial aid  faculty stipends and research  the remaining     million will go toward covering almost half of the cost for a new building projected to be built next to the current complex  in addition to being the largest gift for the business school to date  it is also among the largest donations in ucla history  the donation will help with ucla s campaign to raise      billion by       mrs  anderson donated the money to help maintain the school  which has become mainly self supporting and no longer receives state funds for master s degree programs  read the full story on metromba com    david fajgenbaum  md  msc  has been working toward his mba as if his life depends on it  because it does  on sunday  in his commencement address to his classmates at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  he will share just why he believes a graduate management education can be the difference between life and death  fajgenbaum was diagnosed with idiopathic multicentric castleman disease  imcd  in       a rare and poorly understood hematologic disorder in which the immune system becomes activated and causes cells to release inflammatory proteins that ultimately shut down the body s organs  at the time of his diagnosis  he was in his third year of medical school at the university of pennsylvania s perelman school of medicine  he took a year s leave and underwent aggressive chemotherapy  which initially was unsuccessful  over a six month period  he was hospitalized for four and a half months and even read his last rites  but ultimately the chemo helped put the disease into remission  and fajgenbaum returned to complete his md  he then proceeded straight into the mba program at wharton  prior to his diagnosis  fajgenbaum had no intention of pursuing an mba  but his disease  combined with research he conducted in medical school  convinced him that he could do nothing else   there was no choice   he says matter of factly   i viewed what i would learn in my coursework at wharton as the information i needed to keep myself alive  to solve this disease  and to extend my life  i needed this training to take this disease down   why you need a business degree to battle deadly diseases when he returned to medical school after his diagnosis  fajgenbaum dove headfirst into researching his own deadly disease  which has a    percent five year survival rate  he made some dramatic breakthroughs  in an article published recently in the journal blood he turns much of what had previously been understood about the disease on its head  suggesting a new concept of imcd pathogenesis and presenting a new sub classification system  but he also encountered major roadblocks  biomedical research  he found  was plagued by a lack of overarching strategy  limited collaboration  and inefficient use of funds  perhaps even more damaging  limited resources like tissue samples weren t distributed in ways best geared toward finding a cure  too often  says fajgenbaum  experts in a given field keep all of the tissue samples to themselves  without access to samples  other researchers are shut out from the process  unable to contribute to eradicating rare diseases  in       he co founded the castleman disease collaborative network  cdcn  to help accelerate research and treatments  still  he knew he needed the training an mba would offer to keep moving forward  especially given that he was already conducting research on penn s campus  wharton was the obvious choice for business school   there is nowhere else i would rather have been   he says   it was a no brainer   now  guided in great part by the training he has received at wharton  fajgenbaum and the cdcn are trying to democratize research by collecting tissue samples directly from patients and distributing them to researchers more strategically  to this end  he has developed a brand new model for building patient registries  one that allows patients to enroll themselves but grant permission to a team of healthcare professionals to verify the medical information  this hybrid model combines the high quality of physician powered registries with the affordability and greater reach of registries powered by patients  he has also connected all the physicians and researchers in the world who are interested in castleman disease there are     in his network and then crowdsourced among this community to determine what research should be conducted first  finally  he has helped encourage and facilitate collaboration with pharmaceutical companies  all with the goal of accelerating the path toward a cure   when you are dealing with research and deadly diseases  there are serious downsides to not coming up with a solution   he says   you should be willing to try anything  everything has to be on the table   wharton s community rallies around fajgenbaum s fight the support and community fajgenbaum encountered at wharton has astounded him   i came to business school expecting that i would be able to gain the skills that i needed to take down castleman disease   says fajgenbaum   what i didn t count on was the wharton community getting behind me the way it did   twenty fellow students have given as much as    hours a week of their time to be part of the cdcn s leadership team  the help this team has provided from working with a researcher at columbia university to obtain tissue samples to creating marketing materials has been invaluable   i never imagined there would be this significant group of wharton students who would make this their passion  too   he says  he calculates the roi of his mba in terms different than those of many other business school students  the way he sees it  he has gotten at least a    fold return on the two years he devoted to business school in terms of the time and energy his colleagues and classmates have given to serve on the team and be part of the fight  laser focus could result in a blueprint for all rare diseases also while at wharton  fajgenbaum worked together with some of his classmates to develop a business plan for how the cdcn s approach to eradicating castleman disease might scale to combat other rare diseases  the venture  coined cure accelerator  was a semi finalist in the wharton business plan competition  bpc  and won the bpc social impact award  for the time being  though  scaling to combat other rare diseases will have to wait   if i didn t have castleman disease and we weren t on the edge of so many breakthroughs  i would pursue that with everything   fajgenbaum says  but for now  he simply doesn t have the bandwidth  message for fellow business school graduates fajgenbaum suffered a third relapse while at wharton  requiring a third debilitating round of seven chemo agents administered over a three week cycle  but not only will he graduate on time with his class on sunday  he was selected by a committee of his classmates to deliver the student commencement address  so what does he plan to say  first  he wants to remind his fellow graduates that there are countless problems outside the traditional mba industries that a business school education can help solve   your mba puts you in a position to transform and overcome hurdles in any industry   he says  not just investment banking or consulting  second  you can have impact even if you re not a subject matter expert  business school graduates who know nothing about medicine can still be instrumental in driving research forward  by offering innovative strategies for motivating researchers or novel means of incentivizing collaboration  for example   you can change and transform industries based on the unique resources you have developed here   he says  last but not least  he will remind his class that it takes an army to make change   we would have made one percent of the progress and breakthroughs we have made if it were me doing it by myself   he underscores  turn to your classmates  your colleagues they will be there to support you  on to his dream job as his classmates toss their mortarboards skyward and head off to their post mba jobs  fajgenbaum will continue on his mission to find a cure for the disease that still threatens his life  he has just accepted a full time research position at penn s medical school that will allow him to spend    percent of his time researching castleman disease   it s a dream come true   he says  even though he is returning to medicine and research  he has every intention of turning to fellow wharton graduates and future business school students for help and insights   we desperately need smart business students to come up with solutions to these complex biomedical problems   he says   not enough people are applying business strategies to biomedical problems   he laments   it s a bunch of mds and phds doing the best they can  but when we can get smart mds and phds in the same room as smart mbas that s when we can really come up with ideas that will change the world   teams from    of the leading business schools in europe convened last week to compete in    different sports as part of the   th annual mba tournament  mbat   hosted by hec paris  more than       mba student athletes battled each other in everything from badminton and basketball to petanque and salsa dancing while also creating valuable new friendships and networking opportunities   mbat is the meeting ground for mba students across europe  and new friendships and networking opportunities are at the heart of the tournament   bernard garrette  hec paris mba associate dean  said in a statement   the mbat provides the chance for students to put what they have learned in the classroom to the test on the field  creating and leading strong teams   the unique event  called the mba olympics by some  is the largest intra sporting event among europe s leading business schools  more schools than ever took part this year  including the university of cambridge s judge business school  esade  ie business school  iese business school  insead  london business school  the university of oxford s said business school and host school hec paris  they gathered for three days of intense competition and camaraderie on hec paris s campus from may  th through  th  hec paris mba students organize the event  which gives them real life  hands on experience managing a large scale  multinational project  fortunately for daniel connell and ruchi verma  this year s mbat co presidents  the process of coordinating the complex logistics for the annual event drawing students representing    nationalities is not quite as challenging as it was when the mbat debuted in        organizing mbat during those days was a logistical nightmare   recalled patrick delamaire  an hec mba      alumni who helped organize the first mbat   accommodations for players at the nearest hotel were impossible since the hotel was closed for renovation   he added  today  in addition to competitions in    different sports  this year s three day event also featured three major soirees  a casino royale even  a   s retro party  which included a battle of the bands  and a tex mex fiesta  which featured the salsa competition   the competition was the brainchild of briac pinault  president of the hec mba student council in       as a way to promote hec paris globally in the context of a sporting event  it has almost quadrupled in its scope  initially drawing teams from just six other european schools  learn more about the hec paris mba tournament    pop quiz  how many columbia business school  cbs  alumni work for morgan stanley  graduates of the new york city business school make up     of the investment banking giant s current employees  cbs reports  including chairman and ceo james gorman     and brad evans      managing director and vice president of the firm s investment banking department  gorman and evans  together with cbs professor meyer feldberg      also are members of the school s board of overseers  ties between the school and the firm grew even stronger earlier this spring when morgan stanley donated       million toward cbs s new manhattanville facilities  the  transformative gift   as a press release last week called it  will create two morgan stanley suites  one in each of the new buildings now under construction  it represents the largest corporate contribution to the manhattanville campus to date  what s a suite  you ask  in the case of the morgan stanley suites  each will include a    seat classroom with multiple adjoining study rooms  the gift was first announced at an april   th event hosted at morgan stanley s headquarters by a slew of morgan stanley top executives who are also cbs alumni  including michael boublik      chairman of mergers and acquisitions  daniel simkowitz      co head  global capital markets  and nelson walsh      vice chairman  investment banking  professor feldberg  who is a senior advisor at the firm and also served as former cbs dean  gave special remarks   if you had to describe  in one word  a strategic plus for a school like columbia  it s connections   dean glenn hubbard said during the event   we have more connections with the world around us than any of our peers such as with firms like morgan stanley and we deliver that network regularly in our classrooms  in our research centers  and in the experiences of students  faculty  alumni  and staff  this is key for us   hubbard praised morgan stanley and the friends and alumni responsible for the generous gift  which will help the school in its mission to create learning spaces that encourage community  collaboration and increased communication  the morgan stanley suites are just some of many flexible spaces planned for the new manhattanville facilities  comprising         square feet  the new campus will more than double cbs s current space  learn more about morgan stanley s       million gift to cbs  what s harder than juggling the frenetic pace of classes  clubs  recruiting and studying that fills the two years of an mba program at a top tier school like the university of chicago booth school of business  doing it as a single mom  and yet  there are moms who do just that  and do it well  sofia vargas and natalie wilson are co chairs of mothers at booth  a student club whose name says it all  vargas      has a three year old daughter named gabriela  natalie      has a five year old daughter gabrielle  the two gabbys play together often as their moms hit the books   booth was one of the only schools i looked at that had a specific group geared toward mothers   says wilson  when she asked about resources for parents at other schools  she was referred to partners  clubs and while undoubtedly valuable to their members  she found that these groups usually served the female partners of men who were working toward their mbas   it is a very different experience when it s the mom who is going to school   wilson notes  indeed  especially when it s the mom who is also raising a child on her own  as is the case for both wilson and vargas   i just really loved that booth saw the difference  and saw the value in having a group specifically for moms   says wilson  as co chairs of mothers at booth  vargas and wilson are working to plan a series of events  including a mother s day brunch later this month   they opted not to schedule it on mother s day  but a week later  recognizing that moms would probably want to spend the actual day with their families   they are also hoping to draw successful booth alumnae who are moms back to campus to share their experiences balancing family life and work  another forum they hope to host will focus on hr issues of particular concern to moms paid medical leave  whether or not an employer offers a place for breastfeeding mothers to pump  the difference in healthcare costs for individuals versus families   there is just so much i didn t know before having my daughter that i didn t factor into the equation of what kind of salary i would need   wilson says  events like these are designed to serve not only students who are currently moms  but also those who hope to become moms in the future  in addition to co chairing mothers at booth  wilson also co chairs two other student groups  net impact and the african american mba association  aambaa   and interns part time at a private equity firm in the suburbs outside of chicago  vargas  for her part  is the co founder of two companies  one a chain of organic grocery stores in mexico  and the other  a nonprofit that provides early childhood education to children in the slums of india  so just how do they juggle classes and coursework  club and other extracurricular commitments  recruiting and being a mom   you have to be very organized   says vargas  a typical day involves waking around   a m  to shower and dress before waking her daughter  leaving the house by   to drop her off at daycare  arriving at school by   to prepare for      a m  classes  squeezing a couple of meetings and or calls into her lunch break and more class from      until      or study on the afternoons when she doesn t have class  at      she leaves campus to pick up her daughter  feed her dinner  play together  bathe her and put her to bed before cramming in another four hours or so of study  at the very end of the day  around midnight  she ll sometimes watch an episode of homeland  if she has the energy   my classmates know that i am unavailable from   to   in the evenings  and on the weekends i don t work   she says   that works for them and the rest of time i am super efficient   wilson s day is much the same  she fits in some early morning study time before waking her daughter to get her ready for school  she stays on campus most days from   to      going from class to group meetings  and a terrific babysitter two evenings a week allows her to take one evening class and have another night devoted to study  but in the other evening hours and weekends that she spends with her daughter  she tries to stay unplugged and really focus on having quality time together  and she stays up late  often until two or three in the morning  doing more work after gabrielle has gone to sleep   my friends just call me  nocturnal nat    she says  she acknowledges that she probably doesn t get quite as much sleep as she needs  but there will be time for that later  she says  both moms credit the extremely flexible curriculum at booth for making it possible to be mba students and single moms at the same time   i love it  because you can pick whatever you want to take   says vargas   i can t take evening classes between   and    but the curriculum is varied and often the same classes are offered both in the morning and the evening   wilson  who was an undergrad business student at wharton  was also drawn to the fact that she wouldn t have to spend time retaking core business classes that she d already completed  understanding classmates has been another key factor in allowing both women to thrive at booth   the thing that has surprised me most is how much some of my classmates really want to get to know my daughter   says wilson  she frequently brings her gabby to campus events on friday afternoons  where she runs around and has a great time   there are some classmates who know her better than they know me   wilson says   i was really apprehensive about how flexible some people would be or how understanding they would be of my experience   wilson remembers  instead  teammates will often propose doing a google hangout in the evenings rather than a group meeting  recognizing that it s easier for her  she says  or they ll all head to her apartment  where they can study together while her daughter sleeps  for vargas  one of the most challenging aspects of her time at business school so far has also proven one of the most rewarding   i think the hardest thing  especially at the beginning  was to be clear with my group mates that my daughter was my greatest priority without making it sound like a limitation   she says  but over time she has learned how to do exactly that   it has been so rewarding to realize that i have the right to put some limits and prioritize my life and my time with my daughter   she says  prior to business school  she worked as a consultant for mckinsey  where she intends to return when she graduates   before when i was working  it was hard to balance my two lives at work and at home with my daughter  in my mba it has been very surprising how welcoming people have been to the idea and how understanding they have been  i realize now that i can organize my life better and set clear limits  and people will respect them   both moms concede that they may not be having the same business school experience that some of their classmates without children or families are   there are limitations on my social life   vargas says   if i wanted to go out more i would go out more  but i don t think i am in the same state of mind as some of my fellow classmates  i m ok with that   without someone she can leave her daughter with for a weekend or a week away  wilson has missed out on some of the opportunities for travel that her fellow classmates have had  but she s okay with that  too   i might not walk away from here having been to    different countries  but i will have the connections and career development i need   being a mom in a top tier mba program requires determination  lots of hard work and some sacrifice but wilson and vargas prove that it is possible   you have to have the will  be very organized and not limit yourself   says vargas   but there are a lot of women like us out there  and the mba environment at least at booth is very welcoming to moms   those of us here at clear admit wish vargas and wilson and all of the other moms working toward their mbas a very happy mother s day  learn more about mothers at booth  deadlines  essays and word count  oh my  the class of      application season is officially in full swing with multiple schools including stanford graduate school of business  gsb   the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and columbia school of business revealing details about the requirements applicants will face  stanford gsb shared this week on its website that its round   deadline for the         application cycle will be september   nd  nine days earlier than last year  applicants who apply in the first round will receive decisions on december  th  the school s round   deadline will be january   th  with a decision notification date of march   th  round   s deadline will be april  th  and applicants in that final round will hear back from the school on may   th  in terms of essay questions  there will be no change this year from last  applicants will get to share just a little more about themselves  though  because the school has increased word count from a total of       last year to       this year  the admissions committee suggests allocating     words to essay a   what matters most to you and why    and     to essay b   why stanford    but allows that applicants can choose to divvy up the word count in other ways if they feel it would prove more effective  according to the website  in terms of when to apply  stanford advises sooner   if you plan to apply in round one or two  we strongly encourage you to apply in round one   reads its website   over the last few years  the number of applications we receive in round two has increased  making it more competitive  do not rush your application  but submitting it earlier is better   wharton also shared deadline information this week  although it has yet to reveal its essay questions  in term of deadlines  round   applicants will need to hit submit by september   th this application season  a couple of days earlier than last year  the decision release day for this earliest round will be december   th  round   s deadline will be january  th  with decisions going out on march   th  and round   s deadline will be march   th  with final decisions going out on may  rd  as from stanford  the advice from wharton is to apply early if possible   we strongly encourage you to apply in round   or     reads its website   the first two rounds have no significant difference in the level of rigor  the third round is more competitive  as we will have already selected a good portion of the class   cbs  meanwhile  announced that the deadline for both its accelerated january term  in which students forego a summer internship and study for    straight months beginning in january  and its binding early decision round will be october  th  the regular decision deadline will be april   th  with its rolling admissions process  cbs delivers decisions to applicants based on when they apply those who apply sooner hear sooner  as for its essays  cbs will keep things largely the same as last year  the first essay invites applicants to share in     words or less why  given their background  they are pursuing an mba from cbs now  the second gives applicants     words in which to explain how they will take advantage of being  at the very center of business   and the final required essay  which also has a maximum word count of      gives applicants a chance to reveal something they think might come as a pleasant surprise to their future cluster mates  of course  harvard business school  hbs  got the ball rolling last week  sharing that its round   deadline will be september  th  its essay questions will be posted on may   th and its official application will go live in mid june  the university of illinois college of business this week announced the launch of an online only mba degree program designed to democratize access to graduate management education  according to u  of i  college of business dean larry debrock  called the imba  it will be the first complete online graduate business degree offered in partnership with silicon valley educational technology company coursera  which offers courses from many other leading mba programs through its platform of massive open online courses  moocs   the college of business is celebrating its    th anniversary this year  and development of this new program was designed to mark the occasion  according to debrock   we re entering the online mba field motivated in part to find new ways to return to the tradition of great public universities making an elite education available to all   he said in a statement  with a price tag of just          the program is radically less expensive than online mba programs offered by leading business schools like carnegie mellon s tepper school of business and unc s kenan flagler business school  of course  the u  of i  college of business is not as highly ranked as the other schools offering more expensive online degrees  and the imba will not feature in person components like tepper s part time online hybrid program  which includes six weekends on the cmu campus over the course of the program  or mba unc  kenan flagler s online program  which features quarterly global immersions bringing participating students together for group sessions in cities around the world  nonetheless  imba courses are all taught by college of business professors  and each specialization has an optional additional component  offered through the illinois edu web platform  that includes discussion with classmates and instructor feedback  and the ability to obtain an mba for less than the cost of a single year s tuition at many undergraduate colleges from a school ranked among the top    in the world is noteworthy  the program also puts a new spin on the traditional mba curriculum  featuring what the school has dubbed  stackable credentials   stand alone specializations in subjects such as corporate finance  strategy  marketing and social responsibility that together build toward the full mba degree   rather than simply transferring traditional mba content online  we re mixing academic disciplines into active learning packages about how businesses work that are preassembled for students   raj echambadi  associate dean of outreach and engagement at the college of business  said in a statement  each specialization is self contained and designed to equip students to apply what they ve learned in a given subject area immediately in a real life business setting  as with most moocs  any of the imba program s courses can actually be taken for free on coursera  to obtain a certificate of completion  participants pay      and to obtain college credit they pay        per course or        per specialization  they can apply for the official imba program before they start or after they have completed any or all of the individual courses or specialization  this means that current professionals can sign up for classes in topics they need for work and later stack together individual certificates to construct a complete degree   this is part of what makes stackability possible   each sequence brings together all the pieces of the puzzle in one place   said echambadi  the stackable nature of the program gives students the flexibility to take courses in whatever sequence they want  a full degree requires completion of    courses  which students who take two courses at a time can do in two years  but they also have the option of stretching the courses out over as many as five years  in this way  the imba program  reimagines graduate education to be more flexible and accessible   daphne koller  co founder and president of coursera  said in a statement  that students can complete coursework before even applying to the degree program is also a radical departure from traditional business school admissions  make no mistake  official enrolment in the imba program does require applying and being admitted  but  success in specializations in the program will be considered as a factor in admission   according to the program s website   the imba really leverages the power of moocs for the first time   debrock said   the first portion of every course is open enrollment and involves people from all over the world  not just those who have applied and been accepted into an online mba program  instructors lead through a cohort system that creates constant  direct interaction among peers   learn more about the u  of i  college of business s new imba program

her team in nepal last year  laird saw that hospitals in nepal were severely underfunded  many having only one bathroom   nepal was far worse than i expected  in terms of how destitute it is  if that

collaborations exist at other leading schools  for his part  hbs dean nitin nohria is especially excited about extending hbx core to hls   we believe that an understanding of business essentials

and accurate benchmarking across the industry and the academy   said gregory w  brown  kenan flagler professor of finance and director of the ipc   few academic researchers focus on private capital because so little data is available   and ipc will change that   dean shackelford called the creation of the ipc just the beginning  indicating that kenan flagler plans to expand its focus on research  teaching  public policy and outreach initiatives that affect private capital markets   since private capital constitutes the majority of global capital  ipc research will have a significant impact on practice and policy  and will spur curricular innovations nationally and internationally   he said in a statement  unc kenan flagler is also home to the private equity research consortium  perc   where academic and industry experts collaborate to generate new knowledge about private capital markets based on objective academic research  the success kenan flager has experienced with perc will

created equal in the minds of consumers   kurt carlson  director of the georgetown institute for consumer research  said in a statement  indeed     percent of consumers who think of their refund in terms of a bonus plan to spend it on something in the near term  the survey found  furthermore  they are more likely to spend it at stores where they rarely shop throughout the year  in contrast  those with the  getting back my own money  mindset hold their purse strings more tightly   consumers who see their refund as money owed them by the government believe their refund belongs where it can do good in the long run   in an investment  savings account  or as a means of debt reduction   carlson said  those in this camp who do spend the refund are more likely than the  bonus  folks to spend it at stores where they shop on a regular basis  the survey found  the survey also found that those expecting larger refunds probably filed earlier than those who are still busy finishing up those returns at the eleventh hour  likewise  more of the early filers plan to spend their refund  of those who filed in january     percent reported plans to spend their refund  compared to just    percent

mba degree  the more you stand to boost your salary  both in percentage and absolute terms  combining survey responses from the mba class of      with analyses of their career progress and salaries  the latest ft rankings data reveal a more significant jump in pay for younger graduates in the three years after graduation than for their older classmates  according to the ft analysis  participants aged    and under when they began their degree enjoyed salary increases of nearly         three years out from graduation  a     percent increase over their pre mba salary  those who were    to    when they began their degree program reported an average pay increase of          to nearly double their pre mba salary  the oldest members of the class  those aged    or above  had an average pay increase of          representing a roughly    percent bump over their pre mba salaries  this pattern was observed in all industry sectors and countries  regardless of whether graduates worked overseas or changed industries  according to the ft  in citing these statistics  the ft made no mention of the fact that the opportunity costs for younger students would likewise be lower  serving to impact roi even further  younger lower level employees who opt out of the workforce for one or two years  depending on the length of the program  stand to lose less in potential income than their older counterparts in more senior roles  the ft did note that older participants were more likely to enroll in one year european mba programs than in the two year mba programs more common in the united states  presumably in part driven by opportunity cost considerations  of those surveyed by the ft     percent of mbas    or under opted for two year programs  compared to only    percent of those aged    or older  of course  only   percent of respondents to the ft survey were    or younger when they started their mba  especially among top tier schools  admissions offices prefer applicants who bring multiple years of work experience to the classroom discussion  the vast majority of ft respondents      percent   were between    and     while    percent were    or above  the ft data also reveal shifting motivations in pursuing the mba degree depending on the age of the students   while the younger participants are primarily motivated by salary  the more senior ones want to develop their managerial skills  those aged    to    wish to achieve both   read the ft analysis  overall  the ft found the mba to be living up to expectations among graduates  even as those expectations differed from one age group to the next  a full    percent of graduates reported they had achieved their goals  whether in terms of roi or in terms of advancing to a more senior role  when to pursue your mba degree is a decision that warrants significant forethought and research  as this ft data show  while roi is of course a consideration for all applicants  it may not be the

for more information about sponsorship opportunities with clear admit  contact us here  first off  congratulations to all the new admits  whether you re starting your first year this fall or returning for your second year  you ll need to answer the following question  how will you pay for the next year of school  if the answer is  all or partially with student loans   we ve got you covered with the information you need to make an informed choice on the right loan for your situation  commonbond is a student lending platform founded by three mbas who created the company based on their own experiences with the unnecessarily expensive and confusing student loan system  we know the experience can be overwhelming and are here to help  so let s get started  if you re a u s  citizen or permanent resident  your options are federal student loans and private student loans  the two key federal loan programs are the direct unsubsidized loan  the  stafford loan for graduate school   and the direct plus loan  you can borrow up to         annually through the direct unsubsidized loan program  that s a great foundation to your funding plan given that this loan comes with a fixed interest rate of       and an origination fee of         one of the lowest rates out there  tuition being what it is these days  however     k is unlikely to cut it  so how do you fund the rest  let s first consider the second key federal option  direct plus loans  rates are presently set at        with a       origination fee  on these loans  like the direct unsubsidized loans  direct plus loans come with the government s broad array of borrower protections   everything from deferment to income based repayment plans   but at these rates  they are likely not the best deal for mbas seeking to minimize interest costs  private loan programs  managed by private lenders  can vary widely in terms of rates  terms  borrowers protections  customer service  etc  however  the interest rates generally land below the direct plus program  offering a savings option for mbas who have maxed out their direct unsubsidized loans  at commonbond  for example  our mba student loan starts at a fixed       rate        apr   when the borrower elects to make automatic payments   that       apr  which private lenders are required to disclose in order to help borrowers make apples to apples comparisons among private loans  includes a    origination fee   here s a table comparing three options   note for international students studying in the u s   securing loans can be a challenge  and often your best resource is your school s financial aid office  they ve pretty much seen it all before and can share the experiences of other recent students to help you find the best financing option for you  many programs even maintain a special agreement with a u s  credit union or bank to help their international mbas  which could mean lower rates on your loans than other private lenders offer  the bottom line for mbas looking for student loans  there are tradeoffs to federal and private loan options  but a mix of both can be the best bet for mbas looking for the best deal  if you have any loan or financing questions  feel free to contact our friendly care team at care commonbond co  they ll be happy to walk you through your options  for more information on borrowing through commonbond

a recent column for forbes  the dean of columbia business school  cbs  took on the question of whether and how much the seemingly ever multiplying rankings of leading business schools matter  his answer  yes   but an applicant s individual needs should outrank any number affixed to a school in the many rankings that abound  cbs dean glenn hubbard  an economist  argues that the quality of a business school can be measured by two simple metrics  input and output  by input he means applications  specifically how many applications a school gets and whether application volume is trending up or down   it stands to reason that the marketplace of prospective students will send the most applications to the best schools  which will  in turn  have more selective admission rates   hubbard wrote  as for output  the second critical metric in hubbard s no nonsense formula  he refers to what happens to students when they leave the school   if the job market deems the students to have received a valuable education  they will receive good job offers   he wrote  adding that data on job offers and salary levels are therefore an important factor to consider to get at the true quality of a school  with just these two pieces  input and output  a picture emerges in which a consistent set of business schools repeatedly rise to the top  hubbard pointed out  this assessment provides a quantitative means of differentiating the best schools from the rest  these schools  hubbard continues  enjoy the  cascading effects of being a top business school   including financial resources that allow for changes to program and curriculum as needed and the ability to attract and retain top faculty   admittedly  the aggregate difference between schools in the top five or    can be slight   hubbard wrote   that means that  while rankings matter  if you are thinking about applying to business school  the question is whether the rankings matter for you   he continued  hubbard called it human nature to apply to a school because it gets ranked highly  likening it to seeing a movie or buying a book after it wins an award   we want to experience the best   he wrote  but regardless of ranking  depending on your own needs and goals  some schools will be better for you individually than others   you owe it to yourself to do your homework on a school s academic curriculum  career management efforts  alumni network  and ability to put you in front of leaders who are shaping business today   read hubbard s full forbes column   do b school rankings really matter   with some lucky applicants now

inaugural hec entrepreneurship barometer  published last week  reveals that almost    percent of hec graduates today are entrepreneurs  up from just    percent a decade ago  hec paris has been increasingly promoting entrepreneurship over the past    years  through teaching  research  mentoring and resources like the hec incubator  to measure the impact of these initiatives  hec paris devised its new entrepreneurship barometer  which surveyed a representative panel of       alumni from the past decade from across hec s various programs   the results uncovered three main trends  namely that the desire to launch businesses is strong and growing among graduates  hec entrepreneurs are value creators in france and the businesses started by hec graduates across sectors are characterized by sound  sustainable business models  in terms of the growth in entrepreneurship  one of the major drivers is a desire for independence and the ability to innovate  according to survey findings  forty seven percent of survey respondents cited wanting to be their own boss as a primary motive for pursuing an entrepreneurial path  interestingly  it is not just the younger students at hec paris who show entrepreneurial drive  in fact  the percentage of entrepreneurs within the school s executive mba program  a whopping    percent  is higher than within any other program  france seems to be the main benefactor from hec paris graduates  embrace of entrepreneurship  of the business startups launched by alumni surveyed     percent overall are incorporated in france  more alumni of the mba program   close to one third   have started businesses outside of france  but hec notes that this figure is partly ascribable to the fact that    percent of the mba program s students are foreign and some of these return to their country of origin upon graduation  the sustainability of the businesses launched by hec paris grads was another key finding of the recent survey  according to the entrepreneurship barometer  the survival rate of graduates  businesses after three years was    percent  compared to a    percent nationwide average   and about a quarter of the hec entrepreneurs use fundraising  more than twice the national average  learn more about the inaugural hec paris entrepreneurship barometer    while columbia business school  cbs  admissions is still busy reviewing

     meanwhile accepted livewire users at stanford had an average gpa of     and average gmat of      while rejected students had an average gpa of     and also had an average gmat of      one interesting element in the stanford livewire data is that the average gmat scores for accepted and rejected candidates are the same  of course  one should keep in mind that many of the rejected candidates at stanford who entered results on livewire had been invited to interview at the school  stanford typically has the highest average gmat of all business schools  so it is likely that the pool of applicants was so strong that gmat scores became secondary  the fact that both accepted and rejected candidates have a gmat of     also shows that stanford bases its admissions decisions on factors other than grades and gmat scores  looking for more data points on admissions results at the leading schools  view the gpas and gmat scores of applicants who got accepted to stanford  wharton

admissions office with several other new hires  the school announced this week  the reinvigorated admissions team complements a recent re launch of the school s two year mba curriculum  johnson reports  judi byers  formerly admissions director at american university s kogod school of business in washington  dc  brings more than    years of admissions experience to her new role at johnson  she joined kogod  where she received her undergraduate degree in business  in      as a marketing admissions coordinator  advancing to lead the admissions team by       johnson s recent innovations seem to have helped entice byers to leave her alma mater for a new challenge   as graduate business education continues to evolve to meet the needs of students entering the business world  it s clear that johnson is staying abreast of the latest innovative advancements in programs   she said in a statement  johnson touts its own history of innovation within graduate management education  pointing to its immersion program  which was at the forefront of experiential learning within mba programs  as well as its introduction of a one year accelerated mba program  which while common throughout europe is still less prevalent among u s  schools  its redesigned two year curriculum  introduced with the entering class of       places particular emphasis on preparing its graduates to lead with a focus on critical thinking  targeted leadership skills and data analysis and modeling    it s clear the revamp of the two year mba program includes impressive enhancements and will make these offerings even more attractive to prospective students domestically and internationally   byers said in a statement  she pointed to other innovation within johnson s admissions process as well

admissions world scratched their heads  how could a school ranked   nd in student satisfaction kick long standing  top ranked schools to the curb   fyi   duke had only ever finished in bw s top five once     years ago  when it came in fifth   amid widespread questions of credibility regarding the new methodology that led to the      results  bloomberg bw this week  march     emailed business school officials to say that it has plans for yet another overhaul of its rankings methodology and plans to publish a new ranking incorporating new and differently weighted core metrics next october  it also announced that beginning with the october publication  its mba rankings will now be published annually  a major shift from the biennial schedule it has upheld since the bw rankings launched in       the system that generated the eyebrow raising      results was based on three core metrics  student satisfaction  recruiter opinion and the research published by a business school s faculty  in this next overhaul  bloomberg bw says it plans to scrap the intellectual capital metric and include class of      placement rates three months after graduation and starting compensation for the combined classes of            these metrics will each be weighted    percent  meanwhile  the weight given to student satisfaction surveys will drop significantly  to    percent from    percent  a newly introduced survey of alumni will count for    percent of the overall score  finally  its survey of corporate recruiters will also carry less weight  down to    percent from    percent  and will rely on a single year s worth of employer opinion data  phew  that s a lot of changes to keep track of  but the main shift  toward including more pay and placement data and weighting it more heavily than student satisfaction  will make bloomberg bw s new methodology more in line with many of the other popular rankings  which place greater importance on pay and placement data  bloomberg bw says that it plans to use      pay and placement data  even though newer data will be available in time for the forthcoming rankings  scheduled to be published in october  the magazine did not explain why it has chosen to use year old data  here s exactly  what bloomberg bw said it its message to business school officials regarding the changes  in addition to increasing the frequency of its full time mba rankings to every year  the magazine also announced that its undergraduate business school rankings will be published annually each spring  beginning in spring       meanwhile  the magazine plans to cease its executive mba and executive education rankings  but it will now publish its part time mba rankings annually  alongside its full time mba rankings  as always  those of us here at clear

the nation s best mba programs  released yesterday  knocking harvard business school  hbs  to second and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school to third  last year  the three powerhouse schools tied for first place  but slight differences on core metrics caused hbs and wharton to slip this year  u s  news uses multiple core measurements to compile its rankings  with the greatest weight given to quality assessments by deans and mba directors at peer schools and corporate recruiter survey scores  wharton s scores slipped in both these regards  as well as in average pay for its mba graduates  precipitating its drop this year in the rankings  stanford came out ahead in terms of average gmat gre scores        average undergraduate gpa        and overall selectivity   with an acceptance rate of just     percent  it was by far the most selective school of all those ranked  with hbs accepting    percent and wharton       percent   these leading metrics helped the west coast

management at cornell university just a few days away  are you busy putting the finishing touches on your application  maybe you are just beginning to consider applying in the year ahead  in either case  if johnson at cornell is on your radar  read on to learn more about just what the school is looking for in its applicants  we recently spoke with eddie asbie  associate director of admissions and financial aid  who joined johnson in      to help develop the two year mba in ithaca class  in our interview  asbie took time to share some of what makes a good applicant in the eyes of the johnson admissions committee  beyond the obvious solid entrance exam scores and strong academics that are par for the course with a top tier ivy league school  collaboration topping asbie s must have list for johnson candidates includes those that can truly embrace working in groups and thrive on collaboration   good applicants are those who can show evidence of their ability to collaborate throughout their work experiences  through leadership roles they ve pursued  and even through roles they ve served in their community   he says   ultimately we are thinking about a candidate who is going to be a part of johnson s community for a year or two and bring unique value to their team  we also have a very diverse  vibrant community at cornell  and we seek candidates that are ready  willing and able to collaborate with students  classmates  faculty and recruiters from a broad spectrum of different backgrounds   of constant consideration is the possibility of placing candidates in front of the school s top recruiters   employers seek collaborators   asbie says  in terms of how best to communicate your collaborative abilities as part of your application  asbie recommends highlighting teambuilding experiences on your resume  including times when you ve supervised or worked as part of a group or led a project  for example  demonstrating involvement in your community is also important   a recommender is a perfect person to attest to your ability to work in partnership with others or in teams   he says  self awareness asbie is always on the lookout for candidates who are self aware with clear short  and long term goals and cognizant of both their strengths and weaknesses   if you are considering a career switch and tap into an industry that you have no background in  we want to know what kind of networking you are conducting  illustrate that you understand this is new territory and that you are taking the necessary steps to understand what the job function entails and what it takes to be successful   also vitally important is the ability to be self aware in regard to your academic background  he says  if you are from a non quantitative background  if your standardized test scores are below average or if your current job isn t quant focused  show an awareness of that fact and the steps you are taking to address it   are you retaking the standardized test  asking for additional quant focused assignments within the workplace  or completing an online course from an accredited institution  if so  share that with us   asbie encourages   if there are any red flags or something that may become a red flag in the future  address it   he says   these actions illustrate your ability to be self aware and implement steps to address deficiencies   true knowledge of johnson  johnson pursues candidates who are ready to roll up their sleeves and learn by being immersed in our program and culture   asbie notes  due diligence is invaluable when it comes to understanding the culture  the education you will receive and the community  don t be  that  applicant who sounds like he she is reading straight from the school website when talking about the program  he warns  a campus visit is one of the most effective means to get to know johnson  if you can visit  be sure to connect with students  especially those within the specific function or industry that interests you  if not  or in addition  network with johnson alumni and the admissions team as part of countless events held around the world or via social media events like webinars for prospective applicants   when contemplating two years of your life and the financial investment associated with enrolling in business school  you need to conduct significant research to explore your future community  painting an accurate picture of what johnson is and where you fit in that portrait   willingness to be challenged  we want individuals who are not afraid of their perspectives being challenged and who are seeking new opportunities   he said  business school is an amazing opportunity to work with students from diverse backgrounds and industries  as well as an incredibly talented faculty   there will be times when you are provided with constructive criticism   asbie warns   these conversations can be challenging  we want candidates who are open to these opportunities to improve and develop plans for implementation   beyond these four key points  asbie adds that academics are equally important to johnson  his team wants evidence that a candidate has

future of the mba degree as the director of a global mba accrediting body shared his picks for the top five mba trends of       andrew main wilson is ceo of the association of mbas  amba   described as an international impartial authority on postgraduate management education  in this role  he pays close attention to the ever evolving mba  in the near future  he tells us to look for alternative funding sources for mba studies  a wider range of specializations  more growth in entrepreneurialism  curriculum changes and flexible delivery and learning  citing the amba      salary survey  wilson notes that corporate sponsorship of the mba has been and continues to fall  which has led to the development of new funding sources  such as crowd funding and peer to peer lending  these  he says   are likely to increase in popularity   and are certainly going to become a trend in        wilson also anticipates the comeback of the mba specialization  which was highly popular about    years ago  the specializations of      will include some from the past  such as ones related to finance  marketing  strategy and technology  but new ones will also become more prevalent  such as luxury goods  healthcare  aviation  education and energy  wilson writes  citing input from mba recruiters  he also anticipates a rise in specializations in areas such as human resource management  project and program management  marketing and supply chain management  something else wilson sees in his crystal ball includes a growing trend toward entrepreneurialism as part of the mba  notably  says wilson  entrepreneurial mba studies are becoming increasingly popular both in the eyes of students and employers   whereas in the past  big employers might have been reluctant to hire mba graduates with significant entrepreneurship coursework for fear that the new recruits would use the job to learn the ropes before leaving to start ventures of their own  today s large firms are increasingly recognizing that innovation and entrepreneurial skills are vital to enable them to compete   he writes  several leading business schools have already begun to implement the curriculum changes that wilson predicts will be a fourth trend in the near future  some of the most significant changes to core curriculum are likely to be more focus on leadership  entrepreneurship  more specializations and greater emphasis on corporate social responsibility  he says  lastly  wilson predicts that greater expectation on the part of students for flexibility in the way in which they learn will drive further innovation in how mba programs are delivered  this could range from programs featuring multiple entry points throughout the years to blended learning platforms combining both online and classroom based teaching  and business schools offering multiple locations will become increasingly common  especially with an ever growing focus on globalization within the business world  read wilson s

world has become  and yet  one major hurdle can sometimes prevent ambitious  talented prospective mba applicants from pursuing their education abroad  that pesky little detail of funding  traditional banks are reluctant to lend across borders because tracking and enforcement of those loans suddenly becomes more difficult  many u s  banks  for example  won t lend to foreign students without a u s

does prodigy finance work   go fund yourself   reads the company s playful advertising line  in fact  that s exactly how it works  prodigy finance is based on a community funded model in which international students attending mba programs abroad receive loans made possible by investments from alumni of the school they attend  for instance  alumni who attended insead will invest in a bond to fund current insead students  additional investors often include the business schools themselves  the school community and other investors or institutions interested in higher education or social impact  by investing in these current international students  they are also investing in the value of the given school s mba program  application process  interest rates and eligibility as for the borrowers  each applicant receives an individualized interest rate  which will apply over a floating base rate  students  individualized interest rates are based on a number of factors having to do both with the applicants themselves  as well as the quality of bureau information prodigy finance is able to obtain for them  their affordability and other market rates they may have access to  as well as the average target rate that prodigy must achieve for the alumni investors and the portfolio of students are also taken into account   the rates that we quote are anywhere between   and    percent above the base rate  and in general  the apr sits between   and   percent   says liz reid  prodigy finance s student brand manager  to qualify for a prodigy finance loan  applicants must provide proof of acceptance to a participating school  the entire    minute application process takes place online  beginning with the applicant stating how much he or she hopes to borrow  within   business days  applicants receive conditional approval  their interest rate and their loan amount  once conditional approval is in place  the borrower can accept the terms  pay an administration fee  which ranges from between     and     percent of the approved loan amount  depending on the length of the program   provide supporting documentation and be on their way to the mba program of their dreams  once they arrive at school  they will digitally sign the loan agreement  and funds will be disbursed directly to the school  in instances in which a student s loan amount exceeds tuition  additional funds for living expenses will be deposited directly into the student s bank account  students from more than     countries are eligible as long as the school they hope to attend is outside of their country of nationality or residence   u k  students are an exception  because prodigy is u k  based  students from that country can take part even if they plan to attend a u k  school   furthermore  with a prodigy finance loan  there is no need for guarantees  co signers or collateral  and borrowers don t have to start repaying until six months after their study period has ended  as long as they are full time students  prodigy finance  from inception to today stevens and his co founders began prodigy finance to fill the funding gap faced by many international applicants across

name just a few   click for a complete list of participating schools   the company plans to expand to even more schools in time  as for the investors  so far prodigy finance s community based funding model is working beautifully   in terms of repayments  we have over    percent repayment rates to date   says prodigy s reid   the main reason we believe repayment rates are so high is because of our community funded model   the students know that the money is coming from alumni who were students once themselves  they don t want to let that community down by defaulting on their loans  they also know that the investors can see their repayment status   it s almost like a  social pressure  in a way   reid adds  prodigy finance investors earn up to   percent annually through a low risk

program designed to help district school leaders strengthen their strategic thinking  problem solving skills and leadership ability as a means of boosting achievement among all students  stanford s graduate school of business   gsb  has partnered with its graduate school of education  gse  to develop the new program  which is called the executive program for education leaders  epel   epel  which targets superintendents and two to three members from their central office  will focus exclusively on leaders from california school districts in its first year  epel will span an entire year  involving participants in both on campus and distance learning sessions taught by stanford faculty  as well as leaders in the field who will speak to the class  the new epel program will be offered by the stanford educational leadership initiative  seli   which also runs a principal fellows program  seli executive director rebecca katz notes that the epel program will be different from other leadership training offered in education  which often focuses on managing rather than on changing organizations   excellent management skills are crucial  of course  but today s leaders have limited opportunities to interact with researchers to come up with new ways to approach and solve problems   katz said in a statement  epel will offer such opportunities   drawing on the expertise of stanford faculty  the program will cover topics including design thinking  crisis management  motivating and managing people  implementing and assessing reform  leading and supporting workforce learning  technology in education  and turning around low performing districts and schools  the program will begin in july with one week on the stanford campus  during which the focus will be on general management  over the ensuring year  the program will continue with off campus  online sessions and one on one support  as well as two additional weekend on campus sessions  on in october and the other in march    in addition to exposing participants to cutting edge research being conducted by stanford faculty  the program fosters collaboration  giving space and time for leaders to build relationships and create networks that support continued learning   katz said in a statement   it can often be lonely in these leadership roles and these supports are crucial to success   the multidisciplinary approach  leveraging the expertise of both the gsb and gse  is designed to help encourage and equip educators with innovative solutions to problems their school districts face   over the course of the year  we hope participants will extend beyond their comfort zone and find new ways to have impact   stanford gsb professor larissa tiedens  who serves as faculty co director of epel  said in a statement  applications for the new epel program are being accepted on a rolling basis until april  st  the cost of the program  which is highly subsidized by stanford gse and gsb  is        per team member  which includes tuition  room  board and course materials  learn more about stanford s new executive program for education leaders     are you wondering how to prepare for a wharton

announcement on the admissions website and also with a voicemail recording on our general phone line   she wrote in a post to her director s blog  but as of this writing  no updates  so  some details about hbs interview invites  they will go out in two waves  one tomorrow  and a second on february  th  historically  hbs has sent out the bulk of its invites in the first wave  leopold offered that her best guess is that roughly     applicants will receive invitations tomorrow  with another     or so receiving invitations next week   i ve said this before  but please don t speculate or develop theories or algorithms about first vs  second   she urged   it doesn t work that way  and it has nothing to do with when you submitted  where you live  or the first letter of your last name   the emails will include all the details you need regarding scheduling  locations  dates  etc  hbs s online scheduler will be available beginning the day after invites go out  giving applicants time to

out of columbia business school  cbs  today is the creation of a new center devoted to social enterprise  a generous endowment gift from sandra and tony tamer will establish the tamer center for social enterprise  which will be devoted to developing leaders focused on impacting society and the environment through management  the new center will also serve as a hub for all future social entrepreneurship activities at columbia  the tamers  gift expands cbs s existing social enterprise program  establishing the tamer fund for social ventures  which will provide seed grants of up to         to select nonprofit  for profit or hybrid early stage social ventures centered on social innovation and impact  it also allows for expansion of the existing loan assistance program  which helps alleviate the burden of repaying educational loans for mba graduates who pursue careers in the public  nonprofit and social entrepreneurial sectors  the tamers  gift will expand this program  increasing the number of alumni it helps as well as the duration of the loan assistance from a maximum of five years to    years    the new tamer center will also provide for an extension of the social enterprise summer fellowship program to columbia students beyond the business school  funding for social ventures at the columbia startup lab and expansion of the advisory network for columbia s social entrepreneurs   the new tamer center will unleash the full potential of columbia s social enterprise and social innovation activities  allowing for a more robust array of options for the growing number of columbia community members who are looking to put social problem solving at the heart of their careers   cbs dean glenn hubbard said in a statement  the tamers enlisted the help of rockefeller philanthropy advisors  rpa   which identified cbs s social enterprise program as the right partner for their goals  tony tamer is the founder and co chief executive officer of h i g  capital  a private equity and venture capital fund   the business school is already known for its exceptional ability to train leaders with keen problem solving and decision making abilities   mr  tamer said in a statement   combine that with its already well established social enterprise program and its strategic position in new york city  one of the most vibrant and active social enterprise communities in the world  and you have all the ingredients necessary to be the preeminent center and source of leadership talent for the social enterprise community   sandra tamer stressed the value of being able to unite columbia s diverse interdisciplinary perspectives through the new center   students studying business  engineering  law  medicine or public policy will now be able to come together to develop new ideas  innovative solutions and practical models to solve emerging challenges facing society today   she stated  learn more about the tamer center for social enterprise at columbia business school  mba entrepreneurial grads specifically those who launched startups during or soon after business school  can expect to make as much as their peers who follow more traditional career paths not long out of school  according to survey data collected as part of the financial times       business school rankings research  of the       mba graduates from the world s top     business schools who responded to the ft     percent had launched a start up  within three years of graduation  the average annual income of these entrepreneurs was           compared to          across the entire sample  the ft reports  a mere   percent of startup founders reported an annual salary of zero three years out  though the ft points out that survey respondents did have an option to not reveal their income level  so the data may not fully reflect the financial risk taking faced by entrepreneurial grads  that said  of the companies launched by survey participants     percent did report still operating a full three years later  in general  startups launched by mba grads tend to fare better than those launched by non mbas  citing the u s  bureau of labor statistics  the ft noted that roughly    percent of new businesses survive three years  far less than the findings of the ft survey and less still than reports from individual business schools  at mit sloan  for example     percent of the      mba graduates started a business  and    percent of those were still operating three years later  according to the ft report   of course   say business school professors  startups launched by mba grads do better because their founders have prepared for challenges within the classroom  iese professor pedro nueno told the ft   if someone is prepared they are more likely to be willing to take a lower salary or cut back to maintain cash flow   he said   they tend to manage better than somebody who just sees an idea and launches without too much analysis   nueno has been tracking the start up success of his mba students for several years and has found that    percent of those who started companies were still in operation five years after graduation  the majority of startups launched by his students are small solo ventures or businesses with just a few employees  still  nueno has found that they earn as much if not more than their peers who went to work for large corporations  the ft notes  the ft s mba survey revealed that a gender gap exists within entrepreneurship among mbas  with only    percent of female graduates reporting starting a company  compared to    percent of male grads  but  notes the ft   this divide is little different to the wider world of start ups  in which male founders are more common the female ones   not all survey respondents went as far as to say that business school itself was helpful with the practical matters of launching a startup     percent said no  or securing financing  a full    percent disagreed   likewise  enthusiasm for the value of business school s alumni networks in the startup launching process was lukewarm  a third disagreed with the statement that alumni helped start their business and more than half     percent  stated that alumni provided no help with fundraising  both the success of mba graduate founders as compared to their classmates in traditional fields and the startup survival rates varied from business school to business school  with institutions ranked in the top five for entrepreneurship teaching faring the best  for example  entrepreneur mba grads from top ranked stanford graduate school of business reported average salaries of          three years after graduation  compared with          for fellow graduates who didn t launch businesses  despite these encouraging statistics  entrepreneurship is still pursued by relatively few within business education  the ft noted  taken together  the survey findings suggest that just   percent of the      mba graduate community currently makes an income solely from entrepreneurial ventures  read the complete ft article   start up costs for mba graduates pay off   georgetown university s mcdonough school of business wants applicants to the school to walk away feeling good about their experience  regardless of whether they gain acceptance or ultimately enroll  to this end  the school s admissions team  led by associate dean of mba admissions shari hubert  launched an innovative initiative last spring to understand the applicant s entire journey through the admissions process from the moment they begin to research schools right up to their arrival on campus  for those who are admitted and enroll   their findings have already begun to reshape the georgetown mcdonough admissions process for the better  hubert hopes  hubert joined georgetown mcdonough in december       coming from a career in campus recruiting for the peace corps  citigroup and general electric   i saw a need for us as an admissions office to be more connected to our customers prospective applicants to understand what they were going through and how they experience us as they apply to business school   hubert says  an mba applicant herself once  she holds a degree from harvard business school   she remembers how daunting the experience can be   i wanted to engender goodwill no matter what the outcome   she says   i wanted them to walk away saying georgetown is a wonderful institution that lives its  jesuit  values   of course  she also hoped that by creating a more positive experience for applicants  the school would increase its yield  hubert shared her goals with graham richmond of southwark consulting  a higher education consultancy that helps admissions offices identify and attract high quality talent   richmond co founded clear admit before leaving two years ago to start his own firm   richmond was reminded of a presentation he d seen by innovation consultancy peer insight  which uses design thinking to help companies map their customers  experiences  in       peer insight helped the university of virginia s darden school of business map out the entire two year mba journey  richmond reached out to peer insight s natalie foley  who thought a design mapping project focused specifically on the mba admissions process sounded like a terrific idea  and so this innovative collaboration to understand and enhance mcdonough s admissions process was born  southwark and peer insight partnered to offer mcdonough a comprehensive study combining a quantitative survey of almost       prospective mba applicants about their perceptions of georgetown mcdonough as compared to peer schools with a qualitative piece that involved in depth interviews with a dozen applicants to georgetown specifically  understanding mcdonough s place among its peers southwark conducted the quantitative piece  fielding responses from     gmat gre test takers to provide georgetown mcdonough with an understanding of how the school is perceived in the marketplace and how it stacks up to its peers  though hubert and her team are still dissecting the results  the high level takeaways from this portion of the study were that press  people and presence  specifically an online presence  are critical  as for the press part   a sense of buzz and transparency are important   hubert says   business school is a big ticket item people are investing in  and they want to understand as much as they possibly can  they especially value third person validation about schools   this validation can come from traditional media  rankings and social media  where people are concerned  the survey showed that applicants had very favorable responses when they received consistent interaction with a school s representatives  to this end  hubert initiated a team wide training program to equip the entire mcdonough admissions team  from the administrative assistant up to herself  with stellar communications skills   we are all ambassadors of this program and of georgetown   she says  and to strengthen its online presence  the school has completely overhauled its website to provide information in a clear  accessible manner  additionally  the admissions team examined and made significant changes to email communication sent to applicants and those who had received admission or waitlist decisions to make sure it was targeted and purposeful   there has been a significant decrease in the number of calls and emails we receive from applicants with questions  we believe because our information is now easier to find  more tailored and timely   she says  another realization that came out of the quantitative survey was just how important georgetown mcdonough s location is to prospective applicants   we learned that washington  dc  was the real gem the fact that we are located in an international  culturally diverse city at the nexus of business and policy   hubert says   by virtue of being here we provide a credible value  and we make sure that there are many opportunities for our students to realize that and take advantage of that  we take them out of the classroom and put them in d c  and vice versa   a closer look at how applicants experience the mcdonough application process peer insight headed up the qualitative piece  conducting a dozen interviews with a set of applicants to georgetown mcdonough who represented a full spectrum of applicant experiences  including candidates who were admitted and declined  those who were not admitted  those who were admitted and enrolled and those who put down a deposit after being admitted but ultimately didn t enroll  the open ended interviews were designed to elicit both emotional and analytical responses to questions about what each applicant experienced at each step in the application process  peer insight culled this copious data to create an in depth journey map tracking each applicant through    distinct steps in the application process  noting highs and lows along the way  some of the highs and lows revealed by the journey map weren t terribly surprising  across the board  preparing for and taking the gmat was identified as a low point in the process by most everyone interviewed  in contrast  the moment of finally hitting  submit  was a universal high  more surprising  though  was realizing the low that immediately followed submission   there was this kind of radio silence   notes richmond  and applicants were left feeling like they had just fallen into a black hole  the peaks and valleys that emerged on the journey map became opportunities for georgetown mcdonough to try to mitigate the low points and enhance the high points  brainstorm sessions bringing together the mcdonough  southwark and peer insight teams focused on just this  and as a group they came up with some innovative action steps to take in response to the findings  for example  in order to be more a part of the high that applicants feel when they hit submit  hubert and her entire team created an exuberant congratulatory video  letting applicants know what to expect in the next few weeks  as for the low that surrounded preparing for and taking the gmat or gre   it s a non negotiable  they have to take it   says hubert   but we found we could help them prepare by providing virtual workshops  and that s what we did   systematically  working in mini groups  hubert s team went through all the highs and lows and came up with two to three goals for addressing each one  some of these action steps have already found their way into a revised admissions process  such as the team video upon submission and gmat workshops  and others will roll out as part of later admissions cycles   the end goal is for students to have a positive experience and walk away with a sense of goodwill with georgetown   hubert says  not all applicants are alike of course  because people are all different  not every applicant had the same emotional journey  in fact  peer insight s qualitative study found that applicants could be grouped into four general personas or archetypes  which they gave names  the first  the   good feeling  seeker   is an applicant who wants to  click  with a school  to feel a sense of connection with the people he or she interacts with in the course of the application process  this type of applicant will often visit the school multiple times over the course of the application process and will ultimately choose an mba program based on a gut feeling about how the school made him or her feel  the second  the  goal oriented ghost   refers to the applicant who doesn t need or want to engage much with a school because he or she has a shorter list of essential criteria often ranking  cost  whether or not it could support a spouse s work requirements  etc  this person applies to fewer programs and is methodical and efficient with the application process  the third persona  the  data enthusiast   carefully examines rankings and the statistics behind them  scrutinizes information on school websites and elsewhere and may even create a decision matrix in choosing an mba program   these applicants may need extra time to make decisions  and they are looking for data to tell them the right answer   hubert offers  and finally there s the  fit questioner   who has a very clear idea of his or her future goals and wants to choose the mba program that will mesh perfectly with them  seeking a cultural as well as an intellectual fit with a school  he or she may visit campus multiple times as part of the application process  understanding what drives these different types of applicants and how they respond to steps along the application journey has transformed mcdonough s approach as well   the personas have provided a way for us to segment the communication we have with applicants based on personality type   hubert says  some types  like the goal oriented ghost  don t need or want a lot of communication from the school  others  like the good feeling seeker  want near constant contact   we had a one size fits all communication plan  one of our  ah ha  moments in this experience was realizing that we need to be more segmented and take into consideration where people fall within these personas and what we share with them as a result   not afraid to share what they ve learned as a partner with mcdonough in this first of its kind study of the admissions process  peer insight s natalie foley was most surprised by how open hubert and her team were to sharing their findings   at a high level  sometimes academia gets a reputation for not being innovative   foley says   i was really pleasantly surprised that shari led this process in such an open way and engaged others throughout the georgetown community   indeed  hubert immediately shared the insights with her colleagues in career services and mba programs   we ve found that other departments are excited to partner with us to improve the applicant experience   hubert says  noting that her colleagues have collaborated on an admitted student website  hosted joint events and donated their time to welcome prospective students   ultimately  the students who attend georgetown will work directly with career services and mba programs  so these departments have a vested interest in this process   she points out  mcdonough also now shares a version of the journey map with applicants as part of the admissions information sessions it hosts   we encouraged them to say to applicants   we know this is the journey you re on    says southwark s richmond   showing that sort of empathy with candidates goes a long way toward inspiring goodwill toward georgetown   finally  hubert and her team were invited to share their findings with other mba programs as part of a graduate management admissions council  gmac  leadership conference at the end of january   the fact that they have been selected by gmac to share with their competitors what they did just goes to show what innovators they are   says richmond   other schools haven t done this kind of journey mapping  and georgetown is confident with what they have to offer and fine with sharing it   he says  the ultimate effects of the mcdonough admissions study and process overhaul remain to be seen  in the short term  the school has seen a positive effect on applications in rounds   and   and will continue to monitor what happens in round    if hubert has her way  yield the percentage of admitted applicants who ultimately matriculate will likewise increase  and even greater gains could still be ahead  hubert s team still hasn t even implemented all of the ideas for improvements that came from this initial study she estimates that they are about halfway there   and her team intends to survey applicants at the end of each future round to track customer satisfaction and identify even more opportunities for improvement  georgetown mcdonough is an advertiser on the clear admit site  this piece appears as part of the school s sponsorship package  for more information about sponsorship opportunities with

admissions at northwestern university s kellogg school of management has devoted a series of recent blog posts to demystifying the admissions process at the school  her most recent post shares what she and her team are looking for as they assess candidates  interpersonal skills  how well a candidate fits with the school s mba program is a significant consideration for the kellogg admissions team  as it is at many top programs   our community values collaboration  involvement and giving back  and we look for that in our applicants as well   wrote admissions director beth tidmarsh in a blog post earlier this week  candidates who thrive in team based environments will fit in well at the school  she continued  so  how can you demonstrate a cultural fit with kellogg in your application  not by showing simply that you are an agreeable team player  tidmarsh wants to see that you can productively push ideas forward  even in the face of disagreement   our ideal applicant likes to hear different viewpoints  respects others  can voice and challenge opinions and isn t afraid to speak up  but can do so in a way that s collaborative and would help further a group or a classroom conversation do more than simply agree   she says  if you have an example of just such an experience  sounds like it might make great subject matter for an essay  or perhaps your ability to work in teams is something one of your recommenders might be able to speak to  not much experience working in teams  don t despair  says tidmarsh   we recognize that some people may come from an environment that requires more independent work   she writes   knowing that you want to grow in this area  explaining that you crave more teamwork and collaboration  expressing that you want to push yourself in that area   all of that is valuable information for our admissions team   check out tidmarsh s entire series for valuable insights as you prepare your kellogg application    a leading indonesian

in singapore  perhaps you re at the beginning stage of the important process to identify which mba programs you ll apply to  maybe  with multiple acceptances in hand  you have the exciting and life altering task of deciding where you ultimately want to enroll  in either case  ann richards  interim director of admissions at cornell university s samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management  has valuable insight to help you make the most informed decision possible   there are a handful of key elements that are essential when trying to choose the right mba program for you   richards says   research  visit and conduct a self assessment to understand what s important to you   she advises  just as important isavoiding emotional influencers that can detract from your ability to make a well informed decision  just because family members attended a particular school for generations does not make it the right school for you  for instance   you really need to know yourself and not be influenced by emotional pulls   says richards  seek advice from recent mba graduates business schoolrankings can help you get a feel for what s out there  but talking to colleagues who have mbas can be even more valuable  richards advises  ask about their experience and what they would do differently if they were choosing an mba today  look for more recent alums if possible  she recommends   most mba programs have changed drastically over the last    years   they ve overhauled their curriculums  constructed new buildings   and the nature of the career search has also changed dramatically   therefore  someone who graduated a long time ago can t offer the most current insights  your own network will provide possibilities as well   think about people you attended college with who have gone on to get an mba and reach out to them  or look within your company or professional networks   richards suggests  identify three to four alumni and ask for five or    minutes of their time  says richards  go to each one with a list of five to six questions that are important to you  were you challenged at your mba program  were your classmates intellectually curious  was it an active learning environment  what was the culture at the school  was it super competitive  team focused  collaborative  of course  you might also want to ask about extra curricular activities  club activities  trips or treks  leadership opportunities  and access to faculty   different characteristics may have different meaning for candidates   she points out  prospective applicants who are thinking about pursuing an mba as part of a career change may want to ask about specific resources available to help with that process  whereas that won t be as important to someone who plans to return to their employer or start their own business  don t forget to inquire about a school s community   the ability to participate or engage and have an impact or leave a legacy is important   richards says  visit schools if possible  after talking with alumni  you should be able to narrow the list of schools that interest you  richards encourages prospective applicants to visit schools whenever possible  ideally when classes are in session and you can sit in on one   see what the engagement between faculty and students is like   richard recommends  how involved are the students  are they participating and engaged  what are the facilities like  what resources are available to students  how happy do the students seem  if you can t visit  correspond with the school   see what happens   do you get a response from the school  from the students  candidates can get a sense of how important they are to a school based on how responsive the members of its community are   it s not terribly important whether you visit before or after you apply  but definitely visit if you can before you make an enrollment decision  she stresses   i often hear people say   cornell wasn t on my radar until i visited   or  i was sure i wanted to attend x school  until i visited    in terms of getting a feel for the culture of the school  your best bet is to meet with current students and ask about their activities and extracurricular interests  if you can  attend a cultural event  listen to a guest speaker or  even better  attend a class or drop by a school happy hour  johnson recently hosted super saturday  when dozens of prospective students visited campus to interview   we happened that night to have our diwali celebration going on  which gave participating prospectives a great opportunity to see for themselves the kind of events our students take part in   richards recalls   although diwali is an indian celebration  it certainly wasn t just indian students participating  it really gives candidates a sense of what it is like to be a student here   it usually doesn t take long to figure out if you click with a school or not  richards notes   i don t think a school should have to grow on you  you should know when you visit that it s a place you can see yourself being happy   she says  size and location matter when it comes to mba programs  size does matter since it can impact the network you develop  when you are considering schools  think about whether or not a class is segmented into cohorts  she advises   if you get to know    people really  really well but don t know anyone else   that might be a disadvantage to you  it might not  but it s something worth thinking about   do you want a city school or a school that is part of a smaller community  richards links johnson s close knit community to the fact that it is not in a large urban center   everyone is close to campus   a five minute walk instead of a subway ride followed by two buses   she notes   that s true not just for students but also faculty and staff   she continues   it s not uncommon for faculty to say   i m going home to have dinner with my kids but i ll come back and see you in the library at        that does not happen at all schools   assessing a school s career services recognizing that the success of a career services office can be influenced greatly by the economy  you can still get a feel for what kind of support you ll receive in a given program  as well as how aligned their career services are with your own goals  a school may have tremendous success in placing students who want to go into consulting or finance but really struggle with candidates who want to pursue marketing  for example   as prospective applicants look at a school s career services  they should look not only at the general placement rate but also at specifics in regard to their individual interests   richards says   if a school has a lower overall placement rate than other schools  but    percent of students are interested in entrepreneurial studies and looking to start their own businesses upon graduation  suddenly that placement rate doesn t look so bad  it is important that students look at the placement statistics through the lens of what they want to do   what role do students play on campus   i think as a prospective applicant you want to look for leadership opportunities  potential to have an impact  orchestrating or facilitating change  spearheading an organization or a club  and how willing the school is to support that   richards continues  if having an impact and getting involved as an mba student is important to you  ask current students how easy it is to start a club or organize a conference and what kind of support the school provides if you do   those kinds of questions will be very valuable to students  particularly those that like to get involved and orchestrate change  they would be really frustrated if they landed in an environment where their voice wasn t heard or valued   know thyself  as an mba student you will have the best experience and get the most benefit out of the program that is the best fit for you  that makes knowing yourself and what you want a vital part of the decision making process  think about whether you want a big or small program  whether assuming a leadership role is one of your priorities  and what support you will need in your career search  try not to fixate on brand names  richards offers   you need to look not only at the brand but at what the school s benefit is   how it will help you achieve your goals  grow  and develop your leadership skills   she says  so  there you have it  with targeted research  campus visits and a thorough self assessment  you can be well on your way to selecting the perfect

second year mba student at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  generously took time out of her thanksgiving break to share just how things unfolded for her  dumonet entered georgetown having worked for five years in marketing and business development for a large international law firm  drawing on a range of resources at mcdonough   including career coaches  career focused student groups  peer advising and the alumni network   dumonet has already received multiple full time offers for next fall and is looking forward to beginning her post mba career at luxury beauty company estee lauder  in the interview that follows  you ll hear from dumonet herself about which resources proved most valuable in landing her dream job  she s also got some great advice for prospective applicants on how to jump start a career search even before arriving on campus  so take note  clear admit  what was your career prior to mcdonough  vanessa dumonet  prior to coming to georgetown i worked for ropes   gray llp  an international law firm  in practice development  with responsibility for business development  marketing  pr and strategic initiatives for the firm s private equity and securities and public companies practice groups  i was with ropes   gray for about five years  and for the last two years i was relocated to hong kong  which was really exciting but also terrifying  in hong kong i was put in charge of developing the practice development team across our asia practices   which meant figuring out how we would market ourselves  help develop our practices on the ground  and integrate regional strategies with international strategies for our offices in hong kong  shanghai  and tokyo  i knew i was going to go to business school long before that  i even took the gmat five years before applying to mcdonough  so i knew getting my mba would always be on the horizon  but some really great opportunities kept popping up at ropes  and i kept taking career focused opportunities knowing that the gmat wasn t going to expire immediately  in retrospect  i m really glad i waited  if i had gone to business school sooner  i wouldn t have been ready to take full advantage of everything at georgetown  when i accepted my relocation to hong kong with ropes  i said openly that i would go for a few years with the plan that after that i would return to the united states and go to business school  everyone knew it was going to happen  and when i left there was at least one person in each of the asia offices  where before me there hadn t been any  i saw my role in hong kong as laying the groundwork so things wouldn t fall apart when i left  along the way  i made great connections in asia and london and in the u s  ca  how have you utilized the mba career resources while at mcdonough  what has been most helpful  vd  so many things have been so helpful   i couldn t put my finger on just one  it has really been the culmination of lots of different efforts  support from friends for one  mcdonough s career coaches are phenomenal and really supportive both from a strategic and personal point of view  i was also involved in the consulting club  the marketing club and women in business  the marketing club has been really instrumental in my search  including in helping me prepare to ace the marketing interviews  which are so different from other interviews  such as finance or consulting   mcdonough s peer advisors have also been really helpful  the peer advisors are comprised of second year students who help first  and second years with resume review  mock interviews and the career search  i am a peer advisor myself now  but last year they were really instrumental in my search  alumni have also been really  really helpful  in fact  an alumna was a large reason i was able to secure my full time offer  which i now have  sometimes you just need people who have been there to cheer you on  and that s been really important to me  ca  what was your summer internship  what were the most important or valuable things you learned from it  anything you wish you had done differently  vd  i worked as a summer associate at citi  specifically in citi cards  mine was a marketing business development strategy role  i was among a class of about    associates across the consumer bank  with    or    of us within cards  i was the only summer associate in my particular group  so i had one on one exposure to my senior vice president and other top executives  but i also sat with the other summer associates in cards   so there was plenty of camaraderie  there really is nothing that i wish i had done differently  it was interesting for me because i d only ever had two very short term positions before i worked at ropes   gray  and i had been at ropes for five years  when you re part of an organization for so long  you forget what it s like to be a new person  by being a new person at citi i saw things through a whole new lens  the relationships i built  exposure to interesting projects and getting to be put into a really big organization and realizing how small i was   these were all really eye opening to me and something i wouldn t have been able to experience were i not getting my mba  ca  what do you hope to do post mba  vd  i did receive an offer from citi following my summer internship  which i was so thrilled about  upon receiving the offer  i took a step back and looked closely at what i had done in my first year at mcdonough  i was looking at marketing roles within financial services   such as the role at citi   because i imagined transitioning into such a role would be smooth based on my prior work in marketing in professional services  but i had been looking at potential opportunities in the beauty and luxury industry as well  in fact  i had also interviewed for a summer internship with estee lauder  i got through the second round  but i wasn t extended an offer for the summer  nonetheless  i kept in touch with an alum who had helped me as i went through the interview process  and she has truly become such a mentor  she is not actually that much older than i am  but she was always there and willing to take all of my phone calls  in the end  she helped put me in touch with the right people to interview for a full time position  and i was ultimately offered a job after graduation as a presidential management associate  pma   it s a great opportunity that involves completing four six month marketing rotations across many of the estee lauder brands  i am so thrilled and excited for the job  longer term  as i told estee lauder in the interview   and i really meant it    i hope to stay there for a long time  if i look at my past experiences  i have been at the right place at the right time and created the right opportunities for myself  come next fall  i am going to be working for a great company with some really amazing people  and i just trust that some opportunities will pop up that i maybe would never even have dreamed of for myself  ca  what advice would you offer prospective applicants in terms of preparing for the mba career search before even arriving on campus  vd  good question  i don t want to say too many things  but you are about to start working harder than you ever have before  having said that  at mcdonough the mba career center actually creates a curriculum for newly admitted students for the summer before we start the program  prior to joining in the fall we had to participate in weekly webinars and had a list of deliverables   all career focused  they proved really  really helpful to us when we got to campus  specifically  we had to work on a list of  stories  based on the types of work positions we had held  for example  we had to come up with six stories about work that we really excelled in  struggled with  times we worked with a difficult team  assumed a leadership position  etc  we each came in with about    stories  it was so useful when we began our career search to already have a catalog of stories we could pull from for our interviews  i would recommend that prospective applicants really think hard about what they liked and didn t like about previous jobs  i personally found that i didn t do enough of that before i started my job search  because i didn t have enough direction for myself at the very beginning  but when i started thinking long and hard about the types of positions that really get me energized  i found that helped to refine my search  if you plan to change careers  it s helpful to identify in advance whether you hope to switch function or industry or both  if you are hoping to change both function and industry  you are going to need to do more work  you are going to need to learn how to do valuations if you are switching into finance  case prep if switching into consulting  etc  finally  i am a forte fellow and i was invited to an amazing networking opportunity before my program at mcdonough began  but i wasn t able to go because i was overseas in hong kong  i would advise prospective students to take advantage of as many opportunities to network with organizations and or other students before you get to campus as possible  really anything that gets you relaxed and comfortable in the setting you are about to jump into will prove helpful  ca  what was the most challenging aspect of your job search process  what resources did mcdonough offer to help with this  vd  i just got the job offer at estee lauder  so i can still remember all of the angst leading up to it  one thing that i tell the first year mba students who come talk to me as a peer advisor is to really practice and do your homework when you are preparing to meet with different companies  research is really important and differentiates you from other applicants  i knew that estee lauder was the right place for me  but being able to answer why a given company is right for you will prove important both for yourself and for the interviewer  doing this research on multiple companies is challenging because it is really time consuming  but it pays off  something that people often forget when they are really stressed out is to use the resources in their career services office  life gets in the way  especially at school where you have to juggle the social life with the career search and with your homework  believe me  i know  but carving out time to focus on the career search every week is really important  making use of those resources   reminding yourself that there are people there to help you   that was something that definitely helped me along the way  i d also remind prospective applicants to keep their chin up  this is a tough search  you do a lot of soul searching  and there are a lot of highs and a lot of lows because everyone will get rejected at least once  i was really thankful for my friends  my career coaches  and for having that network  ca  is there anything else you d like to add  vd  i would just say that in terms of choosing an mba  i think getting a sense for what the community life is like on campus is so important  i am so thankful i was able to get that sense even though i was applying from overseas  i did it by having conversations with students  chatting over email with various people in different departments  when you are deciding on an mba program  it s important to remember that you are going to be spending your life there for the next two years  choosing georgetown mcdonough has been a great  great decision

sexual assault of a university of virginia  uva  undergraduate student at a campus fraternity party  students at uva s darden school of business have chosen to host special events to educate the darden community on the school s sexual assault policy  the darden school association  dsa  organized a  not on our grounds  first coffee   using the informal community gathering that takes place in darden s pepsico forum each morning after the first class of the day as an opportunity to discuss the case in the news as well as the not on our grounds campus initiative to end sexual violence  the

assault policy  as well as to hear from professionals and undergraduate student leaders about the initiatives they are undertaking to help generate awareness   dsa president heidi davies said in a

it  so they push it away  now  at uva  we re in the public eye and in a unique position to get everyone s attention on this   head continued  among other things  the panelists proposed ways that

exists in senior management positions  they found that despite similar ambitions upon joining the workforce  male respondents were much more likely than their female counterpoints to feel like their goals were met  contrary to conventional wisdom  the survey s results showed that this disparity had more to do with corporate structures than with women  opting out  to have families  the study   rethink what you  know  about high achieving women   was conducted by hbs professor robin j  ely  pamela stone of hunter college and hbs gender initiative assistant director colleen c  ammerman and published this month in harvard business review  instead of finding that women s careers were sidetracked because they chose to prioritize family over work  the researchers discovered that the women who left their jobs after having children did so because  they find themselves in unfulfilling roles with dim prospects for advancement  or facing other career limitations   it simply isn t true that a large proportion of harvard alumnae have  opted out  to care for children   they continued    another of the study s key findings  the vast majority of women surveyed anticipated that their careers would rank equally with those of their partners  but many of them were disappointed  the researchers hope the study will help increase public understanding of the actual factors that contribute to the persistent gender gap  shifting focus from women s individual decisions regarding family to how gender stereotypes reinforce structural hurdles women face in the workplace   our women alums are less satisfied with their careers than men are  but we would say that workplace disappointments and shortcomings are to blame   ely told the harvard crimson  in conclusion  ely and her co authors call for companies to evaluate ways to institutionalize a level playing field for all employees   the misguided assumption that high potential women are  riskier  hires than their male peers because they are apt to discard their careers after parenthood has become yet another bias for women to contend with   read the complete study   rethink what you  know  about high achieving women   in hbr    with

researchers  focusing on key transfer phases in the robot design process  to pinpoint best practices and data sharing opportunities  he continued   specifically  the tepper students found that like many other major industries during their earliest phases  much of robotics development is conducted in isolation   without concern for compatibility with work being done by others  this is part of what makes standardization in the field so important  while there are currently government recommendations advising designers to support compatibility  as the world s largest technical professional organization  ieee could play a major role in establishing formal standards  the input of the tepper mbas has been invaluable  say ieee representatives   they were able to combine a strong fundamental discipline in business and marketing with technology and leading experts at the carnegie mellon s national robotics engineering center   said sandeep sharma  ieee senior manager of new product development   their work has enabled ieee to better understand opportunities for our organization in providing valuable insights  products and services to the evolving robotics industry   he added   the ieee tepper marketing course project is one of several such programs at tepper  in which students work together with leading companies and organizations to tackle real world business challenges

fair  less stressful and less time consuming than traditional course auctions  the financial times reports  called course match  the new system involves a single round of bidding by students  after which    high powered servers spend    hours running algorithms to allocate courses  wharton professors decided four or five years ago that the auction system then in place wasn t working as they had intended it to  some students  especially former financial traders  were fairing really well in the auction system  in which class seats were allocated like shares issues  but others were getting inferior schedules  the process was also stressful and time intensive  requiring students to predict the bidding strategies of their peers and go through eight rounds of bidding     we realized there might be something wrong with the mechanism itself   gerard cachon  wharton professor of operations and information management  told the ft  he spearheaded the course match initiative to find a better solution  two years in development  the new system is based on theoretical research by chicago booth professor eric budish on multi unit assignments problems  through the course match system  which wharton students used for the first time last year  they are given     points to allocate to their preferred courses and then additional points to give to other courses in proportion  they have the ability to link courses together   bidding more to get both   are to instruct the algorithm to bid for two similar courses but then ignore one of them if the other is allocated  second year students have       total points  and first year students have just        which students themselves agreed would help ensure that all mbas get a shot at securing the courses they want over their two year program   every student gets the best schedule they can afford   cachon told the ft  student response has been  overwhelmingly positive   he says  adding that participants have found the allocation to be fair and the process easy  cachon believes that course match could have applications elsewhere at wharton and beyond  the next logical step would be to extend the scheduling tool to wharton s undergraduate degree program and then to the university of pennsylvania more generally  from there  other universities and even businesses could make use of it  hospitals  for example  could use the algorithms behind it to allocate complex shift patterns   we re a business school   cachon told the ft   we re always looking for revenue generating opportunities   read the complete ft article

lives up to its title  unpacking the criteria each publication considers and the weight accorded to each component  for its rankings  bloomberg bw bases    percent of the score on how recruiters rate mba hires from the school  another    percent is determined by how graduating mbas judge their program  and the remaining    percent is based on faculty productivity  as measured by a tally of research published in leading journals  u s  news   world report  for its part  considers five main factors to arrive at its ranking  with each carrying different weight in the overall calculation  student engagement accounts for    percent of the overall score  followed by admissions selectivity and peer reputation at    percent each  student services technology and faculty credentials training round out the score  weighted at      percent each  the whitman infographic goes into even greater detail  helping explain the criteria that make up each of the five pieces of the ranking methodology pie  the financial times places huge emphasis on peer reputation     percent the overall score a school receives comes from this measure  faculty credentials and training are next  making up    percent of the score  student services and technology account for the final    percent  the economist weights new career opportunities and educational experience equally  at    percent each  the remainder of that publication s methodology pie goes toward increase in salary pre  to post mba     percent  and networking potential alumni network value     percent   at forbes  meanwhile  the

students  dropping percentile rankings is not correlated to their declining aptitude  in response  gmac this fall introduced a new benchmarking tool that lets admissions officers filter scores and percentile rankings by world region  country  gender and college grade point average  giving the admissions teams the ability to compare applicants against their own cohort  sara neher  assistant dean of mba admissions at the university of virginia s darden school of business  was one of those who asked gmac for help   i need to be able to show my scholarship committee  which includes faculty  that this person is in the top   percent of test takers in his region  despite a lower percentile ranking globally  she told the journal  there is a clear trend in graduate management education toward creating more global programs  which has led u s  business schools to increase recruiting in south and east asia  the journal article notes   but schools also don t want to become factories for high scoring test takers from abroad   the article states  this is in great part because the gmat is far from the only measure of a good business student  leading business schools are looking for a range of factors beyond academic credentials  with leadership and communication skills playing a prominent role  many admissions officers believe that these highly valued attributes  better assessed via interviews  provide a clearer indicator of students  ability to contribute to classroom discussion and excel in the corporate recruiting process  liz riley hargrove  associate dean for admissions at duke university s fuqua school of business  conceded to the journal that assembling a class that represents the full diversity her team is seeking increasingly means passing over some top gmat scorers in favor of lower scoring candidates who bring other strengths  read the complete wall street journal article   on b school test  americans fail to measure up   duke university s fuqua school of business shot to the top of bloomberg businessweek s biennial ranking of full time mba programs  released today  up from no    two years ago  in the process  the north carolina school unseated the reigning university of chicago booth school of business and pushed harvard business school  hbs  out of the top five for the first time in the history of the rankings  the formula bloomberg bw employs to arrive at its rankings is as follows     percent of the score is based on how recruiters rate mba hires from the school  another    percent is determined by how graduating mbas judge their program and the remaining    percent is based on faculty productivity  as measured by a tally of research published in leading journals  fuqua was propelled to the no    spot in great part due to its strong showing as part of bloomberg bw s employer survey  notably  the employer survey was expanded significantly since the last ranking cycle to include responses from       recruiters  up from     in        we changed our employer survey from the last ranking cycle to better reflect the breadth of the recruiting landscape and to collect more data on how well mbas do in the workplace   bloomberg bw said of the shift  schools surveyed were asked to rate schools on how well their graduates performed in the areas the employers deemed most important  and the responses from companies that hire large numbers of mbas were given additional weight  students and recruiters alike praised the collaborative spirit of fuqua graduates  according to bloomberg bw  the school s ranking was also helped by the publishing steam of its faculty   which ranked second among all mba programs in intellectual capital  chicago booth got bumped to no    this year  down from its first place spot in       as a result of fuqua s ascent to no    and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school s rise from third place to second  but more newsworthy was hbs s plummet to no     down from no    in the last ranking  student opinion was the driving factor in hbs s decline  bloomberg bw reports  in       hbs ranked no     in the student survey  and this year it slid to   th   while improvements in other schools  student scores were a factor in the decline  the perception that the school caters to elites while neglecting women and minorities also played a role   according to the bloomberg bw report  specifically  hbs scored lowest among the top    business schools on the atmosphere it creates for women and racial and religious minorities  as for how the school ranks in terms of the climate it creates for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds  hbs students skewered the school  placing it second to last out of all     schools on the list  like fuqua  the yale school of management made significant inroads in this year s rankings as well  securing the no    spot  up from no     in       the new haven program rose in the overall rankings thanks to stronger ratings by both students and employers this year than last  columbia business school also fared well  moving into fifth place  up from   th last cycle  as for a few fun facts compiled as part of bloomberg bw s   th ranking  chew on these  view the complete      bloomberg businessweek business school ranking  don t look for future posts on the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  mba admissions blog  in a final entry

up with news and developments regarding stanford mba admissions via other means   our blog has begun to resemble a tesla at a gas station   wrote admissions staffer victoria hendel de la o as part of a final post on october   th  she attributed the decline of the blog to the school s increasing reliance on other forms of social media to communicate updates  indeed  posts to the stanford mba admissions blog have grown increasingly infrequent over the past year   with the last post going up back in june  this is in contrast to other schools  such as harvard business school  mit sloan school of management and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  where admissions directors and other admissions team members have used blogs as a regular means of communicating directly with mba applicants  thanking those still reading the blog  hendel de la o encouraged other means of staying up to date on the school and its admissions process   complete the stay in touch form   she wrote   this is the best way to stay connected to us  because we will email you event invitations  important updates and other good stuff   she also directed prospective applicants to the school

accepted the gre in       when kaplan first began tracking the issue  gre acceptance by business schools has been growing steadily year over year  kaplan reports  but even as more schools report accepting scores from the gre  most mba applicants are still choosing to submit scores from the more traditional gmat  more than half of the admissions officers surveyed by kaplan this year reported that only one in    or fewer applicants chose to submit gre scores instead of gmat scores  representing a slight increase from kaplan s past surveys  seventy eight percent of mba programs report that they view scores from both tests equally  but    percent of programs say that applicants who submit gmat scores have an advantage over those who submit gre scores   the trend line for business schools that accept the gre as an admissions alternative to the gmat has been unmistakable over the past five years   brian carlidge  executive director of pre business and pre graduate programs for kaplan

decide which exam to take to contact their target schools to ask whether they have a preference for one exam over the other   we also advise students to take the gmat if some of the schools to which

reasoning section is not currently an important part of their evaluation of a prospective applicant s overall gmat score  according to kaplan test prep  which conducted the survey  kaplan found that    percent of admissions officers surveyed this year said that performance on the ir section was not important  an uptick from    percent of those surveyed last year  that said  kaplan reports that    percent of business schools surveyed point to a low overall gmat score as  the biggest application killer   for its      survey  kaplan polled admissions officers from     business schools from across the united states  including    of the top    mba programs as ranked by u s  news   world report  gmat scores are good for five years  and the ir section launched in june       which means that many applicants in the past three years likely submitted scores from the old gmat  without the ir section   as more and more applicants submit scores from the current gmat over the next couple of years  business schools may decide that integrated reasoning performance should play a more critical role   brian carlidge  executive director of pre business and pre graduate programs for kaplan test prep  said in a statement  the ir section is scored separately from the qualitative  verbal and analytical writing assessment sections of the gmat exam  which means that poor performance on this new section can t be masked by stronger performance on the other sections  this  kaplan argues  presents an advantage to those applicants who prepare for and score well on it   similar to how not scoring well on integrated reasoning cannot be masked by good performance on other sections because it receives its own separate score  doing well on integrated reasoning can set you apart from other applicants in a positive way   carlidge says  learn more about the      kaplan survey of admissions officers  the yale school of management  som  admissions team will kick off a new series of online events later this

students  no stranger to the school  de ros herself obtained an iese mba in       she worked as a marketing and sales consultant at dupont before returning to iese in       where she held roles in admissions  marketing and communications and development before stepping into her current role  iese is celebrating the   th anniversary of its mba program this year  and de ros shares details about the plans to commemorate this important milestone in the interview that follows  she also highlights the school s distinctively international approach to management education  sharing new developments that have been added to the overseas module in sao paulo this year as well the opening of a new campus in germany  finally  you won t want to miss her comprehensive description of the application process   including the unique in person assessment day  which includes team case work and presentations by applicants working together in groups  clear admit  what s the single most exciting development  change or event happening at iese this coming year  itziar de ros  there are many new developments happening at iese this year and it is really hard to narrow it down to just one  at a push  i would say the most exciting developments relate firstly to the fact that this year is a very important milestone for iese  as we are celebrating the   th anniversary of our mba program  iese s full time mba began in      and was the first two year mba program in europe  as well as the first mba program in spain  in       we also launched one of the world s first entrepreneurship courses  and our program became the first bilingual mba in the world in       the school s focus on internationality   which which has been present from the very beginning of the mba   can also be seen in the developments added to our overseas module in sao paulo this year   sao paulo is one of four overseas modules iese offers to second year students  alongside new york  shanghai and nairobi   by opting to study some of their electives in another country  this is in addition to our international exchange program   students can tap into iese s extensive presence throughout the united states  latin america  asia and africa  all our overseas modules have proven extremely popular  what i think makes the courses particularly appealing is that students do not just get a superficial look at the business culture of another country  they get a truly in depth experience and a fantastic chance to enhance their global networks  all the international electives are designed to take advantage of the locations they are taught from  classes involve extensive input and practical insights from local business communities  as well as offering participants a variety of networking and recruitment events with top companies  in this vein  the sao paulo module  which is focused on conducting business in brazil as well as opportunities throughout latin america  this year includes an in company project option  called  brazil projects   this new option delves even deeper into the country s market  as part of the course  participating students have to come up with innovative solutions for real life challenges that brazilian companies based in sao paulo are facing  in addition to intensive classes designed to give participants broad knowledge of the business landscape in brazil  students can also get hands on experience by working in situ on consulting projects for a number of brazilian based companies  secondly  in addition to the in company project in brazil  our mba students can now also do an internship designed specifically for budding entrepreneurs  the iese summer entrepreneurship experience is an alternative to the traditional corporate internship taken over the summer between the first and second year of the mba  it offers an exclusive platform for aspiring entrepreneurs to further their entrepreneurial projects whether they are nascent or developed  students who have participated in the summer entrepreneurship experience will also have a dedicated second year elective  called  launch   which gives them further practical guidance on starting their new business  finally  alongside these additions to the mba  this year iese is also opening a new campus in germany  highlighting iese s commitment to germany and to europe  the building is situated in one of munich s most iconic quarters  next to bavaria s parliament houses  and will be the first time that an international business school opens a fully functioning executive education campus in germany  ca  what is the one area of your program that you wish applicants knew more about  idr  i think our work in entrepreneurship is truly exceptional  but often people are unaware when they first join us just how extensive the opportunities and support available to them at iese is  although they soon find out once they start    we have everything from investment funds to training and advice  as well as numerous activities and networking events  for example  our investment fund  finaves  is set up solely to promote and support the new business initiatives of iese students and alumni  since its founding in      it has helped nearly    iese student entrepreneurs realize their projects  and it has invested more than   million euros that has today produced more than    million per year in terms of turnover  some world leading companies got their start from the fund  as well as the investment fund  our entrepreneurship   innovation center  eic  helps train entrepreneurs and offers invaluable support and advice  conferences and forums are frequently organized  one such example is the european growth summit  a network of the     fastest growing companies in europe  this summit is used to share information about challenges and best practices  as well as promote common policies for companies that drive the european economy  we also offer regular events such as  breakfast with an entrepreneur   where an entrepreneur shares their experiences and lessons with mba students  and the  mba entrepreneurs open day  for candidates seeking to launch their own business ventures  which includes panel sessions and entrepreneurship activities  our mba students also organize various clubs and activities  for instance  the entrepreneurs  club organizes a series of events for students to network with successful entrepreneurs and learn from their experiences  the club also works closely with different organizations in barcelona to help students meet entrepreneurs and foster future collaborations between them  this is just a small taste of what we offer at iese  i believe budding entrepreneurs will never have a better chance to get support  training and networks than when they are at business school  so it is important for students to take advantage of the opportunities available to them  as well as this  i think people sometimes do not realize how truly international and diverse an experience studying at iese is     percent of our students are international  and they represent over    nationalities  in addition  students study a north american style two year mba program  which is unusual in europe  while being exposed to the variety of different cultures and perspectives that a european learning experience can bring  students can also study part of the mba in the united states  brazil  china and africa   and draw upon our networks and expertise in these countries  furthermore  as one of the world s most useful languages  the opportunity to learn spanish to a high level can really enhance students  career aspirations  especially bearing in mind the increasing importance of latin american emerging economies  ca  walk us through the life of an application in your office from an operational standpoint  what happens between the time an applicant clicks  submit  and the time the committee offers a final decision  e g  how many  reads  does it get  how long is each  read   who reads it  does the committee convene to discuss it as a group  etc   idr  from an operational point of view  the application process is a long one  every year we receive around        information requests and organize more than     events around the world  iese s mission is to offer a personalized approach  so we offer all our applicants help through their admissions process even before they hit the submit button  firstly  candidates will either request an informational interview or we give them feedback  based on their profile and the information they have given us  and advise them whether or not to apply  at this very early stage in the process we are acting as consultants  if we feel our program is not the right fit for you  we will let you know and even recommend other programs that better suit your career goals  once an application is submitted it goes through a first read which lasts around half an hour or so  with the application being re read and reviewed before each subsequent stage in the interview process   candidates can submit their application even if their gmat score is missing  although no decision will be made until the application is complete  candidates who succeed from the pre committee stage are then invited to a one hour interview  this interview is always conducted by a highly trained member of the admissions team who is also an alumnus of the school  interviewers are always part of the admissions committee so they do affect the decision  during the interview we cover all aspects of an applicant s life   yes  we will go through the application itself but also beyond it to find out who they really are as an individual  we want to learn about their accomplishments and  most importantly  their fit with iese s mba  one of the mistakes candidates make is concentrating too much on only their professional and academic experience  when there is often something interesting about what they did when they were    or what they do after work  in the interview  we make sure these kinds of experiences are covered  once candidates have passed the interview stage they are invited to an assessment day  attendance is not mandatory but it is highly recommended  assessments are conducted all around the world to give candidates the best chance to attend one close to their country   last year we organized them in places like new york  sao paulo  singapore  new delhi and barcelona   we also usually organize an open day before the assessment day so people have an opportunity to familiarize themselves with our campus  experience the case method and get to know other applicants  current students and alumni  on the assessment day itself we gather a small group of people and work with them for the day  dividing people into groups of around    to    per room  in larger rooms two groups will run consecutively   we then put them into teams and give them small cases to work on  they have to conduct presentations  take questions from the audience and we also have lunch with them  it s a fantastic way for us to get to know them better and explore how they communicate  as well as their ability to work in teams  for them  it s a great opportunity to understand the business school better and the environment at iese  after the assessment day the application is completed and goes to the admissions committee  for the candidates that have made the effort to come to the assessment we try to let them know the outcome by the week after the assessment  ca  how does your team approach the essay portion of the application specifically  what are you looking for as you read the essays  are there common mistakes that applicants should try to avoid  one key thing they should keep in mind as they sit down to write them  idr  the essay portion of the application process is really our introduction to a student  who is this person  how are they different  what value will they add to the school  these are the questions we want the essays to answer  the essays are the best opportunity for candidates to excel from the rest of the applicant pool   and we read them very carefully  so they should be written carefully  too  the writer s strategy should firstly be to think about those who are reading their essays  we read hundreds of essays and some are just carbon copies of each other  after reading so many applications  you can really tell if a candidate has thought sincerely about his or her answers  or if they are just using the same essay from another application  the special ones make you feel as if you are right in front of that person and having a conversation  they make you say  i want to meet this person   there is limited space  so candidates must use the essays wisely to show what they can offer the school  fundamentally  they should approach it as if they are selling a product   what sets you apart from others  a common mistake is for people to copy and paste their essay from other applications and forget to change the name of the school  obviously  we understand that candidates apply to more than one business school  but this carelessness to review the essays does show a lack of interest that we take into account  a good tip is for candidates to not get too bogged down detailing every single aspect of their lives and experiences like it is a checklist   as i said before  we want to know what really makes them unique and  importantly  what value they can add to our program  when we finish reading the essay we should have a clear idea about who you are  your skills and what you can contribute  the kellogg school of management at northwestern university wants to be known for educating leaders who inspire growth  and it s rolling out a new brand strategy with this in mind  the school announced earlier this month  part of a larger strategic plan launched four years ago  the new  inspiring growth  theme is intended to capture both what the school has

according to recent data from the graduate management admissions council  gmac s      application trends survey  released earlier this week  showed that as two year programs enjoyed application volume gains  other graduate management programs saw flattening or decreasing numbers of applicants  the survey also revealed an increasingly global applicant pool  with gmat testing trends showing that more students are seeking to study outside their country of citizenship  according to gmac  these candidates make up a sizeable portion of the applicant pool for many mba and non mba graduate management programs   viewed in tandem  there is good news for both students and schools in this survey  as well as in our recent corporate recruiters survey  released in may        where four out of five companies said they planned to hire mba graduates in        sangeet chowfla  gmac president and ceo  said in a statement  the most recent application trends survey found that    percent of participating full time two year mba programs reported growth  up from    percent of programs last year and just    percent in        for schools  the rise over the last three years in two year applications is welcome   chowfla said  notably  this year was the first in the past five when a majority of programs reported increased numbers of applicants   for students  gmac s corporate recruiters survey may very well signal a change in hiring from a cost driven  recession driven organizational focus  to a growth driven focus utilizing the skills that mba programs are designed to develop   chowfla continued  full time two year mba programs in the united states reported growth from both foreign candidates and domestic candidates  sixty five percent of programs reported receiving more applications from foreign candidates this year over last  while    percent of programs reported receiving more applications from domestic candidates  the gmac survey revealed mixed results for other graduate management programs  among specialized business master s  non mba  programs  those in marketing and communications  information technology  management and accounting all experienced application growth this year  but master of finance programs saw application volume decline for a third consecutive year  application volume for professional mba programs  including part time  flexible  online and executive mbas  remained flat as compared to last year  meanwhile  six out of    business schools with one year mba programs reported declining application volume  a notable reversal of a two year trend of slowing rising or steady volume for these program formats  view gmac s      application trends survey report  fred staudmyer  assistant dean for career management at cornell university s samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management  has more than    years of experience in executive recruitment  human resources  human capital consulting and entrepreneurship  before joining johnson in       he led the garrett sayer group  an executive search and specialty staffing firm focused on technology  financial services and consulting industries  prior to that  staudmyer held a range of other senior positions including human resources officer for ziff communications focused on human resources and recruitment and head of worldwide talent management for chase manhattan bank  he also happens to be a  dual cornellian   having obtained both his undergraduate and mba degrees from the university   i ve always been a career geek   staudmyer confessed in a recent interview with clear admit  indeed  he knows a thing or two about helping people shape their careers  we caught up with him last week  when he generously shared some top tips for prospective mba applicants to jump start the career search before arriving at business school  read on and take note   you might even discover that some of staudmyer s advice will help you in the mba admissions process  too     not all business schools are alike   staudmyer reminds prospective applicants  students often place too much emphasis on rankings and geography and not enough consideration as to what school really fits them   he adds  think about what kind of experience you want to have   if you want to be anonymous  don t want people to know you  and don t want to make a lot of friends  johnson isn t the place for you   he advises  with only     students in its two year class annually  everyone knows one another at johnson  which makes for a very different experience than a school with           students  doing your homework before getting to business school will not only give you a leg up in your career search  it can also help you in the application process itself  of course  many students come to business school to explore potential career paths  one of the best things you can do in your application is illustrate that you have done your research  know what you want to get out of an mba and are prepared to take the steps to get you there  staudmyer says  not everyone who comes to johnson arrives knowing exactly which immersion they want to select  he stresses  in fact  the school offers a range of sessions early in the program that are designed to allow students to explore what each immersion is about  it can be overwhelming if you wait until the last minute to think about your career path  he cautions   the more you can do in advance of your arrival  the more successful you will be   he says   time management is a key skill to be successful at business school  anything you can do before joining the family will get you started in the right direction and place you one step ahead of your peers   learn more about johnson s immersions   don t miss the blogs by

program  harvard business school  hbs  has stated publicly for some time that it accepts both the gmat and the gre and does not prefer one over the other  in a bid to be even more transparent on the issue  hbs admissions director dee leopold devoted a recent post on her director s blog to the matter  to substantiate the claim that the school is agnostic in terms of a preference between the two tests  leopold chose to reveal exactly how many applicants submitted each type of test score  along with how many of those applicants were ultimately admitted and matriculated  while the vast majority of applicants opted to submit gmat scores  the percentage of matriculating admits as compared to total applicants broken out by test were within close range  leopold did note one important change in the admissions process at hbs this year  which is that candidates will no longer have the option to submit both test scores   we need to officially verify scores and prefer to do it for only one test per candidate   leopold wrote  she also shed some light on how her team looks at test scores  be they from the gmat or the gre   we care less about the overall score than we do about the components   she wrote   and we look at the subscores in the context of the candidate s profile   what this means  she continued  is that the gmat or gre q score of an engineer with top grades who has been doing highly quantitative work on the job is of less consequence that that of an english major with no quantitative coursework or professional experience  the english major would be helped by a strong gmat gre quant score because it would serve to show leopold s team that he or she will be able to handle the quant work at hbs   the corollary is true too  candidates who don t have a background that demonstrates extensive practice in reading and writing may be helped by strong verbal subscores   leopold continued  as a final reminder  leopold adds that every candidate does need to submit either a gmat or gre score when he or she applies   we don t accept lsats  mcats  sats or the fact that you had exceptional undergraduate grades   she wrote  unofficial scores are fine for the application  and official scores will be accepted after the deadline read leopold s complete post on gmat gre  as leading mba programs welcome students from the class of      to campus  many have been eager to share

paths vs  anything to do with evaluation   she writes  at hbs  financial aid is need based  but the school does not award full fellowships  she says  to be clear  no  student will be fully funded by hbs  underscoring the point that admissions is need blind  leopold notes that applicants do not apply for financial aid until after they receive an offer of admission  finally  hbs does have a loan program for international students which does not require a u s  co signer  applicants will receive an awards package from hbs only after they have completed a financial aid application   in making our awards  we rely on a formula which takes into account whether you are single or married and can be adjusted for documented exceptional circumstances   leopold writes  noting that parental income

in their personal and professional lives  called  purpose  passion and principles    or the p  program for short   the student led initiative debuted last fall after roughly a year of development  participants take part in nine small group discussions held once a week  in which one student serves as a facilitator  the student facilitator directs the conversation and helps create a safe environment in which students explore topics ranging from reflections on meaningful past life experiences to what success means to them to visions of their ideal future lives  the students who helped lead development of the p  program based the first year s discussions on a book entitled springboard  launching your personal search for success  written by wharton professor g  richard shell  they also drew from other well known leadership books  including total leadership  by wharton professor stew friedman  and bill george s true north   for me  p  was an opportunity to slow down and block out the craziness   wrote yang  sydney  liu  one of the students who helped create the program  in a recent article in the wharton magazine   more importantly  for the first time in my life  my peers challenged me to verbalize what i truly value in my professional and personal lives  and reconcile my decisions and values   liu continued   this critical examination forced me to be honest and authentic with myself a vulnerable position that i  like many others  shy away from   according to liu  news of the program traveled quickly among students at the school  and by last spring more than     had expressed interest in taking part  with only a limited number of facilitators  the program could accommodate fewer than half of those  but a new set of facilitators for next school year will double the program s capacity   the p  buzz is spreading outside of wharton as well   liu added  p  student leaders piloted the program last semester with the penn law school and the wharton undergraduate program as well  and informal alumni groups have formed in new york city   i am excited by the program s energy and potential impact it could have on wharton s culture   lui said  liu cautions that the program is not designed to serve up an answer to students who are struggling to figure out what their life s work should be  rather  it helps students think about their life and

number of top tier business schools have begun to use software to track prospective applicants  interactions with their school in an effort to gauge how interested they are in attending  according to a recent article in bloomberg businessweek  the data points   which can include whether a student has emailed admissions staff  how many admissions events they ve attended and whether they requested program information   are now included in candidate profiles alongside test scores and essay responses  bloomberg bw adds  most schools report that student interest isn t a main factor in admissions decisions  but the fact that increasing numbers of schools are using the tracking programs suggest that the data gathered counts for something   i don t know if that makes or breaks anyone s admissions decision  but when you re getting down to the nitty gritty and trying to factor in likelihood of matriculation  that s the kind of thing we look at   liz riley hargrove  fuqua s associate dean of admissions  told bloomberg bw  she noted that the tracking system fuqua uses  called talisma  helped the school increase its yield by   percent last year  the university of chicago booth school of business and kellogg use a similar software called slate  which is marketed as a tool to  maximize your yield and build the desired class   booth dean of student recruitment and admissions kurt ahlm told bloomberg bw that it is  very rare  for the school to make an admissions based on student interest level but allowed that the measure has become one piece of the overall application  does this mean that you should begin to flood the admissions office of your top school with dozens of calls to show your interest  not necessarily  some schools   including mit s sloan school of management and the university of california at berkeley s haas school of business   have not adopted tracking software  according to the bloomberg bw article  sloan senior director of admissions rod garcia would rather spend the tens of thousands of dollars the software costs on extra recruiting trips   i think if we go into the tracking business  we completely change the goal of the office  we become an analytics outfit rather than educators   he told bloomberg bw   i guess we still do business here the old fashioned way  and that is relationships   read the complete bloomberg businessweek article   business schools get smarter about weeding out uninterested applicants   a greater percentage of mbas and other business school graduates seeking jobs in fields like technology  manufacturing and healthcare reported having early job offers than did those searching in the more traditional fields of finance and consulting  according to survey results released by the graduate management admissions council  gmac  earlier this month  gmac released results from its   th annual global management education graduate survey on june  th  the global exit survey  conducted in february and march  polled       business school graduates at     universities  of those     percent had at least one early job offer  down slightly from    percent in last year s survey but still a huge improvement over the    percent who had offers in the same time period in       at the time of this year s survey     percent of the graduating students were involved in a job search  and another four percent were either self employed or intending to pursue entrepreneurship at graduation    this snapshot of the early job market for business school graduates demonstrates that graduate business degrees are useful in a wide variety of careers   gregg schoenfeld  gmac survey research director  said in a statement   while demand remains strong among traditional industries  business school graduates shouldn t overlook alternative sectors  which are actively seeking mba and other business school talent   he continued  manufacturing and healthcare pharmaceuticals emerged as promising sectors for business school grads  with a notable    percent of students searching in these sectors reported having at least one early offer  the technology sector  too  showed significant promise  with    percent of those seeking tech industry jobs reporting that they already had an offer in hand  of all students with early offers     percent were in the technology industry  up from   percent with early offers in tech in       early offers in consulting made up roughly the same slice of the overall pie as in previous years  gmac reports  among all job seekers     percent of those with early job offers were in consulting  compared to    percent in       but fewer of those seeking jobs in consulting had early offers       than did those in less traditional fields  like last year  roughly a quarter of all job seekers reported early offers in the finance accounting sector  down from    percent in       here  too  the    percent of those seeking jobs in finance accounting who had early offers was lower than in the technology  manufacturing and healthcare sectors  reported salaries for those with early job offers showed healthy gains over last year  though salaries vary widely by industry  job level and work location  the median increase in salary of those with job offers was    percent over their pre degree salary  up from a    percent increase reported last year by graduates with early job offers   the job market for business school graduates has rebounded nicely since       and employers in all sectors recognize they need the business skills and acumen these

profiles of students from the class of      sharing their day to day experiences over the course of a normal week at business school  the group includes four men and five women who came from around the country and the globe to pursue their mba at stanford  more than half of the students profiled are international  hailing from brazil  zimbabwe  china  india  south korea and argentina  each

imagine yourself as an mba at stanford  harvard business review recently published its first formally crowdsourced article  a piece entitled  the capitalist s dilemma  that included contributions from almost     harvard business school  hbs  alumni  the experiment was designed to helped build on a theory put forth by renowned hbs business administration professor clayton christensen about the flawed way that companies make investment decisions  which he first explored as part of a new york times article in       lead authors christensen  who is best known for his work on disruptive innovation  and derek van bever  a senior lecturer in entrepreneurial management at hbs  used a collaborative platform developed by hbs alumni  called openideo  to first define the questions they were asking and later solicit input and peer review for the piece  colin maclay  who directs hbs s digital initiative  explained the approach in a recent article in the chronicle of higher education  the concept of crowdsourcing an article was to put ideas  out in the open  so that  one  everyone can see them  and two  people can comment on them  elaborate on them further  and help to develop them  to take what might be a kernel of an idea into something that s much more powerful   he said   part of our intention in piloting this was to demonstrate the power of this approach for other faculty at hbs and beyond   van bever said in a statement   and we really believe that  going forward  taking advantage of this capability is not only possible  it s really revolutionary in terms of the speed with which we re able to work   but also with an alumni base as rich in experience and diversity of perspectives as ours is  you d be crazy not to tap that if you could   van bever added  the debut crowdsourced article was considered a huge success   clay has said very recently that he never wants to go back to the old method   van bever noted  digital initiative  one of seven new cross disciplinary efforts underway across hbs designed to examine and contribute to innovation and disruption in business  is now compiling a series of additional crowdsourcing challenges for the coming

gazette article on the crowdsourcing experiment  mit sloan school of management  like many top business schools  has recently released its essay questions for the upcoming application season  leaving prospective applicants and others in the admissions community buzzing about how this year s prompts require more or less from applicants than in years past  sloan put a new twist on things late last week when it revealed that its newest question invites applicants to write their own letters of recommendation  make no mistake  these essays are not intended to take the place of actual letters of recommendation  two of which will still be required of all applicants to sloan  instead  the new essay prompt is designed to encourage applicants to reflect on themselves in a new and different way  specifically  they are asked to put themselves in their most recent supervisor s shoes and   from that manager s perspective   offer an assessment of how they themselves interact with others  stand out from others and what they would change about themselves  sloan director of admissions dawna levenson said in a press release that the new essay question was inspired by the increasingly common business practice of having employees rate themselves and peers as part of      degree  performance reviews  an article in bloomberg businessweek on the new essay noted that it could also be a  sly nod to the idea that applicants might be accustomed to writing such letters   bloomberg bw cited a recent survey by the association of international graduate admissions consultants  aigac  that found that    percent of aspiring mbas were asked by at least one recommender to draft their own letters of recommendation  while drafting your own letter or recommendation  either as part of the new sloan essay or on behalf of recommenders who request it  does offer applicants the opportunity to highlight the qualities and attributes they believe will best support their overall application  it is not without its challenges   it s hard to envision a way applicants can write about themselves from a hypothetical manager s perspective without getting cute or sounding downright smarmy   bloomberg bw notes  as part of the article  bloomberg bw consulted clear admit ceo eliot ingram for his take on the new prompt  which comes as part of a continuing effort on the part of schools to get a more authentic picture of prospective students   it s an interesting way to talk about oneself in the application  using someone else s voice   ingram told bloomberg bw   but that presents a question because it s often difficult to talk about yourself   read the complete bloomberg businessweek article   how to write your own recommendation without getting in trouble     a team of mba students from

nespresso s headquarters in lausanne  switzerland  earlier this week to compete in the finals  where they presented their ideas and recommendations to the company and answered questions from a panel of judges made up of leading business and sustainability experts  the ross team s prize for taking first place will be a week long trip to costa rica  one of nespresso s strategic sourcing companies

part of your ultimate career path as any class you take while on campus  and yet  amid the many pressures that confront mbas when they return to campus in the fall  it can be easy to lose sight of experiences and impressions they may have had while interning  now  thanks to an online resource developed by a recent harvard business school  hbs  graduate  current students can keep track of their goals and experiences during summer internships  creating a resource to help them gain as much from the process as possible  called life guides  the website features a summer internship guide to help mbas quickly and easily record and summarize their summer internships  enabling them to better understand what they want to do with their careers as a result  recent hbs grad phil strazzulla created life guides   and the summer internship guide in particular   in response to his own experience as a summer intern at an investment bank after his junior year in college   i didn t have a great summer and knew i wanted to do something else   strazzulla recalls   nonetheless  three weeks after getting back to campus in september  i was ready to sign my full time offer for said bank   he d completely forgotten how dissatisfied he d been with his internship and what his original goals had been  fortunately for strazzulla  he re read a journal entry he d written over the course of the summer before signing the offer with the bank   the    minute exercise of writing that journal entry literally saved me a few years in a job i didn t want   he says  life guides  summer internship guide is free and easy to use  consisting of just a few simple steps  in may or june  registered users can briefly reflect on their goals at the start of their internships  in july  they receive an email inviting them to complete a mid summer update  recording their experiences and insights while interning  in september  they get a summary that captures what they learned  experiences recorded as part of the summer internship guide remain completely confidential unless users choose to share them with other members of the life guides community  those who do choose to share their experiences add to a growing

business school  hbs  prepares to debut its new online education program on june   th  some of its leading professors debate the strategy behind the school s decision regarding how to respond to the rise of massive open online courses  moocs   a new york times article yesterday explored the thinking behind hbs s online platform  hbx  which will attempt to preserve and extend the school s competitive advantage by creating online courses that  unlike moocs  replicate hbs s distinctive discussion based case method teaching  but that do not compete with the mba itself  unlike rival schools such as stanford graduate school of business and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  which have chosen to video their professors teaching courses which they then distribute for free as moocs  hbs has developed its hbx platform in an attempt to create a new segment of business education  namely the pre mba  according to the times report  since last month  it has admitted several hundred students  mostly undergraduates  into a program called credential of readiness  or core  that includes online courses in accounting  analytics and economics intended to provide liberal arts students fluency in  the language of business   tuition for the courses  which students have nine weeks to complete  is         the times article called hbs s  issue of how to address online education  the school s biggest strategic decision since        when it first adopted the case study method  the approach chosen by hbs dean nitin nohria so far seems to favor the strategy advocated by famed hbs professor michael porter  who has written   a company must stay the course  even in times of upheaval  while constantly improving and extending its distinctive positioning   by seeking to replicate the case study method online while not competing with its own mba program  hbx does just that  but  the times article points out  another famed hbs professor  clayton christensen  questions whether the hbx approach will be enough to survive the threat presented to business schools by online education  christensen recently predicted that half of the united states  universities could face bankruptcy within    years  as christensen sees it  the only way for market leaders like hbs to survive  disruptive innovation   as he has coined it  is by disrupting their existing businesses themselves  much as stanford and wharton are doing by making their mba content available for free via moocs  in some cases  christensen allows  companies have  survived disruption  but in every case they set up an independent business unit that let people learn how to play ball in the new game   he told the times  which hbs hasn t done  hbx is too closely tied to the business school  christensen argues  nohria and others believe that disruptive innovation may indeed be the demise of second  and third tier business schools  but that hbs s brand  network and distinctive case study method would protect it   i do not believe our mba program is at risk   he told the times  adding that he doesn t believe that disruption is always all or nothing   in the music business  all record stores are gone   he said  while in retailing   it s not like amazon has eliminated everything  after those debates  my feeling was that we re going to be more in that category   at the same time  hbx   along

school attributes to better  storytelling  and branding  according to a report in triangle business journal  unc as a whole has been working to increase brand recognition  and the increase in applicant volume at the business school is in part a result of these branding efforts  sridhar balasubramanian  associate dean for the mba program  told the triangle business journal    traditionally that  strengthened brand  has been a weakness for us  so it s been something we have worked to address   balasubramanian said   that includes things like crystallizing the brand message  formalizing brand elements and also being consistent with advertising about who we are   according to the triangle business journal report  kenan flagler saw upticks in the number of applicants across the board  with increases from both domestic and international applicants and both women and men  the triangle business journal notes that kenan flagler does not expect to increase the size of its class in

just works very  very hard to get through the numbers   balasubramanian told the triangle business journal   they re delighted to have larger numbers  so they ve been very focused on that   he allowed

the study   led by researchers ezekiel emanuel  penn s vice provost for global initiatives  gayle christensen  executive director of penn global  and brandon alcorn  penn global project manager   is the first of its kind to focus specifically on moocs offered by a business school  the researchers surveyed more than         students enrolled in nine moocs offered by wharton  contrary to some concerns about moocs   namely  that by offering course content for free business schools risk losing paying applicants to their flagship programs   the penn researchers found that the courses are instead helping business schools reach new student populations  the researchers identified three main new student populations registering for wharton moocs  students from outside the united states  especially those in developing countries  foreign born americans  and under represented american minorities  indeed     percent of survey respondents came from outside the u s   with about    percent from developing countries  of u s  individuals enrolled in the wharton moocs     percent are foreign born  finally     percent of wharton s american mooc students are under represented minorities  the survey found  by comparison  the wharton two year mba program counts only    percent of its students as foreign and only      percent of its u s  population as foreign born  of all students enrolled in traditional mba programs at nine of the top u s  business schools  just    percent are under represented minorities  the penn study on wharton moocs also revealed that completing an online course is not the most important outcome for the majority of the students who take them  a finding researchers took to imply that the business model some schools are adopting   of charging for certificates

hbs  people matter more than money  faw writes   prior to attending business school  i was warned that hbs was filled with people willing to do anything to make inordinate amounts of money and that it is not the place to meet or build true friendships   his experience has shown just the opposite   i will graduate from harvard business school in a few days with many authentic relationships that have already been incredibly rewarding and made me a better version of myself  these amazing bonds are priceless and define my experience here   he writes  another popular misconception is that the only way to make an impact is by heading to wall street  faw cites hbs data on placement locations for recent graduates to show that  in fact  hbs graduates are heading to the west coast in ever greater numbers and are taking jobs in product management  marketing  sales and general management   in a dramatic shift versus a decade ago  technology jobs are just as sought as roles in finance   he writes  think more is better  think again  says faw  one of the things hbs did teach him is that he can t have everything  at hbs   and indeed at most top business schools   students will be exposed to hundreds of classmates who would all be valuable additions to their network  but  pretending to get to know them all is foolhardy  says faw   we have to invest   fully and deeply   in the few people and things that make us the happiest  only then can we make a truly meaningful impact as future business leaders   he writes  these are just a few of the takeaways faw shares from his time at hbs  read his complete post   what my mba at harvard did not teach me   a new york times article this weekend examined the growing number of trips and other  lifestyle experiences  that now compete with academic ones as part of the mba program at many leading business schools  even those that don t offer any form of academic credit can be viewed as valuable networking opportunities that can help position students for jobs upon graduation worth their steep price tags in the eyes of some  as an example  the times story lead with a february ski trip to park city  utah  that about a third of the mba class from the university of texas as austin s mccombs school of business went on  the three day trip  planned by a student run group called the graduate business adventure team  was advertised to cost about         though final costs may have ended up higher sean pool  who is financing his mba degree largely through student loans  opted to sit out the ski trip  though he acknowledge that he realized that in doing so he might be missing an opportunity to bond with fellow students   cliques at mccombs are generally diverse and accepting  but there is to some degree a socioeconomic element to the way cliques fall out  particularly for groups who have the financial means to travel for pleasure several weekends each semester   pool told the times  the increasingly prevalent trips offered as part of the mba take many different forms  from purely leisure to career focused and curricular travel  the latter  because it is for educational purposes and students receive credit as part of a class for it  can be financed with student loans  the times reports  examples of career focused trips that don t carry academic credit include the career treks offered at many leading schools  usually with a focus on a particular industry like private equity  consulting or banking or a particular geography like san francisco or chicago  often  these give participating students an opportunity tour and meet with companies  sometimes providing a valuable leg up in the job search process  ming min hui  a    year old first year student at harvard business school  went on just such a trip  called westrek  over her january break  sponsored by the techmedia club  westrek is designed to give students an insider s look at the tech industry in the bay area  and hui and close to     of her classmates visited    companies in the course of the three day trip  including google  facebook  tesla and several venture capital firms  the times reports  already in her first year  hui has been on eight such not for credit trips  including hiking the inca trail in peru over spring break   an m b a  is very different from a law or medical degree  the m b a  is designed for networking reasons   she told the times  stanford graduate school of business professor jeffrey pfeffer acknowledges that the role of trips has changes significantly since he started teaching    years ago   the social aspects of business school have become more prominent over the last decade   there is no doubt about that   he told the times   students go to vegas and take over a southwest airlines plane  they go to the sundance movie festival  and some of them rent houses on lake tahoe   even students who don t have the financial means to take part find often a way because they view the bonding opportunities to be worth it  some accrue credit card debt  and others take on jobs to fund the trips believing that doing so will help them land lucrative jobs later  one such student  samantha joseph  who graduated from the mit sloan school of management in       worked as a teaching assistant to help fund trips to nine countries during business school  most of them not for credit   if you want to be a global leader in any industry  it s important to see how the business world works and runs in other countries   joseph told the times  mccombs student pool  who has chosen to focus his time and resources on other things  maintains that while they may yield connections  the trips are not essential to success at business school  proof positive  he has forgone the expensive trips and nonetheless secured a summer internship at an investment bank   networking is great  but it s not the no    reason to come to business school   he told the times   and if you are spending a lot of time  money or resources doing it  you are probably doing it all wrong   read the complete new york times story   in b school  is that a syllabus or an itinerary   following the round   notification

north american full time mba programs  as a follow up to its global ranking  as an introduction to this north american specific list  the economist calls america the  spiritual home of the mba   noting that the first mba was offered there more than a century ago and that today  u s  schools dominate the publication s global ranking   eight of the top    business schools in the worldwide ranking are located in u s   among the top    north american mba programs  the university of chicago s booth school of business claimed the top spot  as it did in the global rankings   among the other highest ranking north american schools were several prestigious u s  names  including dartmouth s tuck school of business  harvard business school  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  mit sloan school of management and stanford graduate school of business  the highest ranked canadian mba program made the list at number     york university in ontario  it is the only non u s  school in the north american top     the economist report attributes american schools  size and history as among their big advantages   they help them achieve the financial clout to attract the best professors and students and to build the finest facilities   read the economist  noting that every one of the     professors who teach wharton s       mba students holds a phd   meanwhile  huge endowments  which are often used to subsidize tuition  help them attract the brightest students   the report added  noting that of the    schools at which the average gmat score is over         are american  career services at u s  schools also received stellar marks from the economist survey respondents   chicago  tuck  virginia and columbia all rank in our global top five schools when it comes to opening new career opportunities   reports the economist  having said that  graduates from north american programs typically earn a little less than european or australian counterparts  most often because they have less work experience before starting the mba  but just as they lead in many other categories  american schools also have the highest price tags   something not as universally celebrated as an advantage  the economist notes  view the economist s complete list of top    north american mba programs    beginning with the           application season  current students at the university of chicago booth school of business will no longer read the applications of prospective candidates for the school s mba program  instead  admissions staff will assume responsibility for reading all files  a shift school administrators hope will both provide for more consistent evaluations and free up the student reviewers to interact with prospective members of the booth community in more meaningful ways   the consistent read piece is only a small part of why we have changed the ga role   stacey kole  deputy dean of the full time mba program  told poest quants   the driving force behind the change in our graduate fellows program is to further engage students as ambassadors  providing meaningful connections between our students and those not yet in our community   the university of pennsylvania s wharton school made a similar change two years ago  discontinuing the use of mba students as first readers  at chicago booth  the reaction to the change by this year s student readers was initially mixed  but they were engaged in discourse with the admissions staff before final changes were presented to the dean for approval  according to an opinion piece by one of the students in chicago business  the school s student newspaper   the changes are nuanced and far reaching  the driving force being to increase the interaction between booth students and applicants via on campus programs  communication  branding and interviewing   wrote vladimir andonov  a class of      mba at booth  until now  booth applications were assigned to mba students known as admissions fellows  chosen for their involvement as first year students in giving tours and running admit weekends and their demonstrated passion for the school  according to the p q report  fellows would be assigned as many as    to    files a week in peak periods  and they would be tasked with grading each of six elements  test scores  academics  work experience  extracurricular activities  essays and

a list of all the winners  mba students will find a new core curriculum that places greater focus on leadership and modeling and analytics when they arrive on campus at the samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management in the fall  planned changes to the core also include shifting the timing of the courses to better accommodate an increasingly intense recruiting environment  johnson s core has remained relatively unchanged for the past decade  though individual course are constantly adjusted to reflect feedback gathered from students  alumni and recruiters  the changes planned for next year are the result of a systematic reevaluation of the entire curriculum undertaken by the administration  they were outlined in a recent article by jeffery gordon  mba      in the cornell business journal  johnson associate dean douglas stayman chaired the review committee  which included both faculty and staff members  the review process took place over three years and included focus groups with students and alumni as well as a survey sent to more than a thousand recruiters  students and alumni  gordon reports  the purpose of the survey was to gauge how effectively the existing johnson curriculum met the needs of each of these constituencies  respondents were asked to benchmark johnson students and alumni against graduates from other business schools on a range of skills and then indicate how important they felt those skills were in today s workplace  according to stayman  feedback was consistent across all three groups and defined several key areas of improvement for the school  chief among them being leadership and communication  modeling  analytical skills and better preparation for internship interviews   the new core curriculum seeks to address each of these issues   writes gordon   the most important change is to the way johnson teaches leadership  which the new core will address in a more systematic fashion   specifically  leadership development will be a part of mba students  full two years at johnson  beginning with a course called  leading teams  in august prior to the first year  continuing with  critical and strategic thinking  in the second half of the fall semester  and culminating with  principled leadership  in the first half of the fall in the second year  to address the call for greater focus on modeling and analytics  the existing  statistics  course will be redesigned into a course tentatively called  data analytics and modeling   to be taught by professor bill schmidt  finally  because the recruiting process at business schools has changed significantly over the past ten years  the timing of the core courses has been adjusted to reflect the fact that recruiting for internships now begins much closer to the start of the year   many students and alumni complained about the course load during the heavy internship recruiting season  and many recruiters commentated that johnson students were underprepared for their

all know the cost of an mba is not insignificant  beyond discussion of whether or not the investment is worth it  what if you could deduct the costs as a business expense  can you  a recent marketwatch article delved into precisely that question  answering with a resounding  depends   the general rule regarding business deductions for educational expenses says that as long as you incur the costs to maintain or improve skills used in your current job or self employed business  you can deduct the costs as a business expense  the marketwatch piece reports that the irs has always argued that an mba degree automatically trains you for a new profession  preventing you from deducting those costs as unreimbursed employee business expenses or as self employed business expenses  but marketwatch goes on to point out that the tax court takes a different position   it says business deductions are allowed if the mba training maintains or improves skills used in your current job  profession or business   writes marketwatch   for example  if you are a marketing professional  i think you can clearly deduct mba costs under this standard   the article continues  that said  if the mba courses are taken before or shortly after you are hired in order to meet educational requirements for the job  then you can t claim tax deductions for mba costs  likewise  you cannot deduct the cost of your mba if it trains you for a new profession  marketwatch also provides the following guidance   non business credit  mba costs are eligible for the non business lifetime learning tax credit  which can be worth up to        a year under the rules explained earlier   non business deduction  you may be eligible to claim the non business deduction for up to        or        of mba tuition and related fees on page   of form      under the rules explained earlier   clear admit is in no way offering tax advice  but if you are interested in learning more about potential deductions you might be eligible for with regard to the cost of an mba  you might start by reading the complete marketwatch piece and follow up with a consultation with a tax accountant    spain s ie business school

their campuses yesterday to head to the white house  where they met with senior advisors preparing for the white house summit on working families  the white house is seeking input from a range of stakeholders to identify best practices to develop workplaces that better meet the needs of women and working families   we did not think this goal could be achieved without thinking of the business leaders of tomorrow  and that is why today  we met with a group of deans from our nation s leading business schools to discuss best practices for business schools that can better prepare their students for the increasing importance of women in the labor force and the prevalence of employees with families where all parents work   read a post on the white house blog  the white  house pointed out that though women today are more likely to graduate from college and enter formally male dominated professions  they still confront multiple challenges as they do so  chief among these is that they start their careers making less than their male counterparts  and the pay gap increases over the course of their careers  the white house blog cited one study of mba graduates from a leading institution that found that women earned     k on average when they graduated and     k nine years later  while men earn     k at graduation and     k after nine years  as part of yesterday s meeting  deans from    schools   including harvard business school  uc berkeley s haas school of business  cornell s johnson graduate school of management  yale school of management and uva s darden school of business   discussed the issue of pay inequality  the need for more mentorship opportunities for women  and the need for greater flexibility in the workplace to prevent women from being penalized due to career interruptions such as motherhood  the business school deans also shared valuable insights regarding leadership  retention rates  business school culture and the timing of business school in the lifecycle   in order to ensure business practices that fully utilize a   st century workforce  it is important for business school deans to update their curriculum and practices to fully reflect

programs are rejecting employment offers and choosing to graduate without a job in hand  holding out for positions at technology firms and startups  which hire later than more traditional finance and consulting companies  according to a wall street journal report yesterday   i m not nervous   ellen cory  a second year student at dartmouth s tuck school of business who has turned down several job offers  told the journal   i m not behind for the type of position i m trying to get  i ve seen classmates get a lot of great jobs  and i have confidence that i will be able to find a job that satisfies me   she said  cory s attitude  which according to the journal report is one shared by many students  reflects a big change from just a few years ago  when students tried to lock in their postgraduation plans as early in the year as they could  now  with greater confidence in their own abilities and more optimism about the job market  students are holding out for the perfect job  even if it means graduating without a precise employment plan in place  the journal article notes that this year s information is hard to quantify because most business schools don t track job placement until graduation but added that interviews with current mba students and career services officers show that more and more students are waiting for just in time spring hiring  particularly at tech firms and startups  which can t predict hiring needs as far out and so wait longer to extend offers   the current student population is definitely willing to wait for the right opportunity   jennifer bridge  director of recruiting at the university of california at berkeley s haas school of business  told the journal  last year at haas  roughly    percent of graduates had job offers at graduation  but only    percent had accepted offers  the differential between offers and acceptances has historically been closer to   percent  the school reports  as students grow choosier   and demonstrate more patience   in the job search  career services officers are changing their strategies as well  even coaching students in some instances to wait for the best offer  the journal reports  a tuck survey of      graduates found that students who accepted jobs after graduation reported being more satisfied than those who did so before graduation  read the complete wall street journal article   can mba students afford to wait for that perfect job    as we reported last week  geoffrey garrett has been named to replace outgoing dean tom robertson and will take the helm on july  st  so what s clear admit s take on this new dean  we welcome what we believe to be a strong candidate and wish him well in his new role  a political economist with a pacific rim orientation but clear u s  interests as well  we think garrett will make a good fit for wharton on several levels  he brings an understanding of the intersection between business and politics that will lend itself well to wharton s focus on globalization and on preparing its graduates to understand how business is done internationally  his appreciation of collaboration and innovation   consistent with two other main points of focus at wharton   were also among the things that made him a front runner in the search process  the school noted in the press release announcing his appointment   while dean of the australian school of business at the university of new south wales  unsw   garrett helped to create a university wide innovation center bringing together faculty and students from business  design  engineering and science   his approach to scholarship and discovery fits perfectly with penn s commitment to integrating knowledge across disciplines   penn provost vincent price said in a statement  indeed  wharton s commitment to fostering collaboration is evident even in its mba interview process  which now incorporates a group exercise designed to assess how effectively candidates work together  garrett also brings a nice combination of academic and practical experience to the role  which should appeal to various constituents at wharton  in addition to serving as professor of business and dean of unsw  dean of the university of sydney business school and in numerous other academic roles  he was also the founding ceo of the university of sydney s united states studies center and the president of the pacific council on international policy in los angeles   finally  he understands that the school is facing pressures from globalization and technology and brings a distinct point of view on how to address them   like other sectors  globalization and technological change are poised to transform business education   garrett said in a statement   i have no doubt wharton will be in the vanguard of this transformation in america and around the world   in our conversations with them in the days immediately following the announcement  officials at wharton expressed enthusiasm about the choice  and we echo that enthusiasm  we think geoff garrett is a good candidate to lead wharton  and we look forward to seeing how the school evolves under his guidance  far fewer mba students from europe s top

gsb  yesterday confirmed that  for the first time ever  it has stripped a graduate of his mba degree because he was admitted to the program under  false pretenses   the wall street journal reports  the graduate in question   former sac capital advisors employee mathew martoma  who completed his mba in        was convicted last month of insider trading charges   martoma does not have a stanford mba   stanford gsb spokesperson barbara buell confirmed in a separate report by poetsandquants  according to the journal article  martoma s admission to stanford s mba program was rescinded  effectively nullifying the degree he was conferred more than a decade ago  the move came not because of his conviction  but because he failed to disclose on his application to stanford gsb that he had previously been booted from harvard law school for falsifying his grade transcript and sending the forged document to federal judges when seeking a job  that detail emerged as part of the unsealing of documents in advance of his february trial  martoma had changed his name by the time he applied to stanford gsb two years later and covered up the fact that he had been dismissed from harvard  stanford s decision to revoke martoma s admission indicated that then director of stanford mba admissions marie mookini did not know that he had been expelled   what makes this possible is not that he was a convicted felon  but that he was admitted under false pretenses   a faculty member told the journal  according to multiple reports  stanford sent martoma a letter last month seeking an explanation about statements he made on his original mba application  he was give a two week deadline to respond  and after a request from his lawyers  he was also granted a two week extension  the extension ran out on friday  with no response from martoma s legal team  stanford gsb  citing privacy laws  has declined to comment on martoma s academic record   federal law  ferpa  prohibits stanford from discussing the specific academic status of a former student   spokesperson buell told poetsandquants   however  we take very seriously any violation of the integrity of our admissions process   she said  adding that the school has policies in place for revoking degrees or acceptance offers if a student is found to have gained admission through false pretenses  in addition to no longer having an mba  martoma faces up to    years in prison for each of two counts of securities fraud  as well as up to five years for a conspiracy charge  his sentencing is scheduled for june  the recruitment of african american students and other traditionally underrepresented minorities is a challenge facing admissions directors at leading mba programs  according to a recent post on the ucla anderson school of management blog   this is an issue facing all of the best programs   says alex lawrence  anderson assistant dean of admissions   all of the admissions directors talk about it  it s reality   the relatively low admission numbers of black students in anderson s full time school is a problem that stems from the fact that there are only a limited number of candidates that qualify for the top schools  he says   the pipeline is limited   he says  adding that this is exacerbated by the fact that all the top mba programs are recruiting from the same limited pool of qualified diverse candidates  says lawrence   the question becomes  do you lower your  admission  standards  or should you be proactive to improve the number of students who meet your standards   lowering admissions standards is not the answer lawrence and his team choose  instead  they are working with a number of programs and organizations focused on improving diversity recruiting at the mba level by improving opportunities available to diverse students well before they even consider business school  the riordan programs  founded by former los angeles mayor richard riordan nearly three decades ago  include a number of initiatives focused on high school students  recent college graduates and first generation college students who are interested in business or careers in management  lawrence knows the programs well  since he led them before transferring to admissions  anderson s full time class of      includes more riordan alumni than any class before it  anderson is also a member school within the consortium for graduate study in management  a nonprofit organization devoted to increasing diversity and inclusion in american business  the number of consortium recruits entering the ucla anderson mba program is also at a record high  anderson likewise works closely with the forte foundation and the national society of hispanic mbas  organizations that focus on recruiting women and hispanic students  respectively   it s important for us to leverage these relationships   lawrence says   five to    years down the road  the discussion will change  because there won t be as few candidates as there are today   lawrence says  the passage of proposition     by california voters means that anderson may not consider race for admissions purposes  but lawrence assure minority candidates that they will find at anderson a diverse and welcoming community within a diverse city  learn more about diversity recruiting efforts at ucla anderson  students at the haas school of
