  <title>best business schools for marketing  part i</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the  four ps   product  price  place and promotion  and the  three cs   customers  competition and company  may not have become completely passe  but there s some serious shifting taking place in the world of marketing  companies must reach global audiences of consumers  confront and master the ever evolving intricacies of social media  command the growing frontier of video marketing and get a handle on terabytes of data representing critical market intelligence waiting to be mined </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  mba students who study marketing can go on to a range of careers brand or product management  market research  sales  advertising  marketing consulting and marketing in retail  pharmaceuticals and high technology  adding further to the complexity is the fact that companies identify and structure their marketing positions in many different ways  some companies have large marketing departments in which individual marketers are assigned to roles specializing in market research  strategy or advertising  other firms expect their marketers to have a hand in and mastery of each of these roles  as well as responsibility for p l  collaboration with supply chain and operations and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  drumroll please  which mba programs are keeping pace with the changing marketing industry  who s doing it best and how  is it through changes to curriculum  strategic faculty hires  launches of new centers and institutes of expertise  unique extracurricular offerings  finally  which schools are helping more of their graduates land the most desirable jobs  whether at consumer product goods  cpg  giants like nike  unilever and pepsico  market research titans like neilsen or forrester or ever increasing data analytics shops like cloudera  sumo logic or google  read on for some of our picks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for almost two decades  northwestern s kellogg school of management has placed among the very top programs in u s  news   world report s annual ranking of best business schools for marketing  of course  all rankings have their flaws  but when the same program tops the list year after year after year  it certainly suggests that kellogg is getting something right </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so just what does kellogg do so well when it comes to marketing  for starters  kellogg s marketing faculty is among the best in the world  professor angela y  lee chairs a department made up of almost    tenure  clinical  affiliated and emeritus faculty members who approach the teaching of marketing from diverse perspectives and backgrounds ranging from psychology and cultural anthropology to neuroscience and data analytics </paragraph>
    <paragraph>professor derek rucker  for example  regularly publishes in the world s leading psychology journals  delving into what makes for effective advertising and what motives underlies consumer consumption  professor florian zettelmeyer  meanwhile  who heads the program on data analytics at kellogg  focuses on evaluating the effects of information technology and big data on firms  kellogg s belief has always been that the best marketing education results from the deepest possible understanding of customer behavior  which it feels is best delivered through a wide array of lenses precisely those offered by its diverse faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph>traditional texts meet cutting edge course offerings even amid seismic shifts in the field of marketing  kellogg professor philip kotler s      textbook  marketing management  has remained a standard text at many american business schools  and kellogg also likes to point out that many of the marketing professors leading rival business school marketing departments in fact hold kellogg phds  but kellogg is also always evolving to keep pace with the discipline s shifting landscape  as an example  a kellogg mba student who chooses to major in marketing can also choose the data analytics pathway  which offers opportunities for deeper dives through courses such as  digital marketing analytics  and  customer analytics  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>every mba who graduates from kellogg will have a foundational understanding of marketing since one of the school s nine core curriculum courses is  marketing management   beyond that  students targeting careers in the field can choose from one of two majors  marketing  which provides an in depth understanding of marketing concepts suitable for careers in management consulting  general management  or other functions or marketing management  which is geared toward students set on post mba careers in which marketing plays a central role  such as brand product management or market research </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students can also choose from more than    related electives  which again is how kellogg can stay current with shifts in the industry and encourage its students to view the field of study through multiple lenses  some recent additions to the course options include  thought partnerships  man plus machine is greater than man or machine   designed to teach students to harness data to understand consumer behavior  and  kraft cpg boot camp   a one day program offered last may that brought students face to face with krat company leaders to talk channel relationships  storytelling  nielsen research and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>strategic markets   customers initiative takes marketing beyond the classroom  in addition to its marketing majors and related pathways  kellogg has also launched four  strategic initiatives  designed to focus on key issues confronting today s senior business leaders  again  believing in an interdisciplinary approach  kellogg developed these strategic initiatives to equip graduates across each of its majors with skillsets that will allow them to make meaningful change whatever industry they enter  one of the four strategic initiatives is the kellogg markets   customers initiative  kmci   the kmci serves as a repository for research and insight designed and curated  to help business leaders create and reinvent markets through greater customer insight and focus   according to the kellogg website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the classroom  there are any number of ways for future marketers to get their brand on at kellogg  including a range of centers that fall under the kmci umbrella  since       kellogg has been home to the center for market leadership  which focuses on helping leading organizations learn how to become more customer oriented in order to drive innovation and growth  each fall  the center hosts an annual marketing leadership summit  which lures marketing gurus from leading companies to pool mindshare while tackling key issues like digital disruption  the future of marketing or as at this past fall s conference how to build culture in the digital era  speakers this past october included jim stengel  the former global marketing officer for procter   gamble  talking about intelligent risk taking  and kathy button bell  chief marketing officer for st  louis based emerson  who shared how the engineering firm partnered with hank green  a popular musician and blogger with a strong presence on youtube  to tell its story to consumers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg marketing students take charge since it s kellogg we re talking about  you have to know the students are involved in a big way  the kellogg marketing club is one of kellogg s largest and most active student organizations  putting on a range of events made possible by the sponsorship of numerous companies interested in recruiting kellogg students  like marketing clubs at other schools  kellogg s student run group brings first  and second year students together to let them help one another through interview prep groups that cover interview etiquette  case questions and ad critiques  the second years also share their summer internship experiences with first years to help them know what to expect and how to prepare </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the club also regularly brings chief marketing officers  brand managers and other senior marketing executives to campus for speaker series and hosts an informal lunch   learn program where students gather to discuss marketing trends  the club also organizes marketing industry treks two  or three day trips to leading brand and retail firms on the east and west coasts and  company shadow days  at the proliferation of cpg firms in the kellogg area  letting students get a first hand feel for what a career in marketing would really look like day to day </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  the club also lets students test their marketing mettle through an annual kellogg marketing competition held each winter  student teams of five are challenged to market a randomly assigned real product to the kellogg community  first presenting a marketing plan to a panel of marketing execs  students and judges and then executing on the plan through marketing campaigns on campus and in the evanston community  a fair is held at the conclusion of the competition  where the teams sell their products from booths  a winning team is crowned based on feedback from a panel of judges as well as the target customers themselves </paragraph>
    <paragraph>show me the jobs</paragraph>
    <paragraph>okay so kellogg does a bang up job of preparing its mba students to be marketers  is that enough to land them the jobs they seek at the end of their two years  employment statistics say yes  in          percent of kellogg graduates took functional roles in marketing  earning a median salary of          with a median signing bonus of         </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to help make this happen  the kellogg marketing club joins forces with the school s career management center  cmc  to provide networking events  recruiting advice and opportunities to meet with top recruiters in the field  last year  firms like general mills  kraft  nike  unilever and pepsico were among the top hirers of kellogg grads </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it feels positively philip k  dick esque to think that from the mid   th century until roughly five to    years into the new millennium  moving images delivered across cathode ray televisions were the medium de rigeur to communicate information to a large audience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>although the advent of google glass and oculus rift suggest that virtual reality  vr  advertising could be just around the corner  think of the possibilities for fabric softening bears    video remains  according to the amsterdam based mbatube  the  medium of today s generation   according to the site   approximately    percent of all internet traffic will be video  by       video has become an essential tool that educational institutions use to  recruit and educate students   right now      percent of frequent internet users watch video online   according to mbatube  for business schools  however  there has been a noticeable gap in the marketplace for an  exclusive video platform  that enables them to engage prospective mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>founded by dutch academic marketing advisor and leiden university mba alum rick rudolph  mbatube  according to its bio  is the  only official video portal  on the world wide web where  leading business schools can showcase their mba programs via video   mbatube  bridges the social gap between educational institutions and prospective students  by hosting official  promotional  testimonial and lecture content  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the platform is user friendly and  most importantly  free to use  business schools generate mbatube profiles to which they  upload videos and information to be hosted on the site   institutions that sign up for mbatube have increased opportunities to boost targeted views  increase website traffic  improve seo and reach a  diverse global target audience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>participating schools include </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mbatube allows participating business schools to  access real time analytics on videos  so they can  see how users react to  their  videos  and  get in touch with users who liked  shared  rated  commented or added videos to their playlist   according to the site </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to mbatube s   k  fb followers and  k  twitter followers  the site generates   k  views per month with an    minute average stick ratio   the average age of visitors breaks down as follows </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and the breakdown by country  according to the site </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective post grads tend to undertake thorough research into potential programs so they can make informed decisions about which school will offer the biggest bang for their buck  mbatube posits on its site that business students in particular tend to  engage with institutional admissions staff and pose critical questions before embarking on their program of choice  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mbatube allows prospective students to  compare hundreds of mba programs   view promos  testimonials  and lecture videos  create playlists  perform global searches for all matching mba programs  and share videos with their social media network </paragraph>

  <title>forte announces new self paced mba admissions prep program for women targeting fall      enrollment</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>building on the success of its mbalaunch program a series of targeted webinars and other resources designed to help prospective mba applicants successfully navigate the admissions process the forte foundation has just announced the debut of mbalaunch on demand  based around the same in depth webinars that make up the popular mbalaunch program  this new format will give participating women the flexibility to work at their own pace  applicants who choose to participate in mbalaunch on demand can be ready to apply for the mba by fall      or spring      ideally gaining admission for fall      enrollment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>forte s traditional mbalaunch program is designed for women who are still more than a year out from applying to business school  and its application deadlines and schedule are organized with this in mind  but in spring       forte found that there was a group of pre mba women who were interested in applying for the mba that fall but had missed the mbalaunch application deadlines   there were women who made the decision to pursue an mba later in the cycle and women who hadn t heard of the mbalaunch program during our application deadline timeframe  september to november    explains krystal brooks  who heads the mbalaunch program at forte </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we designed mbalaunch on demand to serve these women to provide them with a structured roadmap to help them build their strongest mba application   she continues   since then  we ve seen very successful candidates move through the program in this self paced  virtual format  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new program offers greater international reach the virtual  self paced design of mbalaunch on demand also makes it accessible to women all over the world  in contrast to the mbalaunch live option  which includes a day long educational and networking event  an assigned peer networking group and a formalized advising program that are based out of a range of u s  cities as well as toronto and london   we want to make the amazing content and resources available to women who aren t able to participate in the in person program   brooks says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that content includes    webinars devoted to gmat prep     webinars on application prep  gmat homework and study plans and an mba application preparation guide  the webinars include speakers from a range of test prep firms and admissions consultants  as well as the graduate management admission council and forte s    member schools  natalie neilson  who took part in the live format mbalaunch program this past year  sees the diversity of content as a major advantage of the program   it s great that they have so many in house gmat resources   she says   for example  on tuesday we would have sentence correction with kaplan  on thursday  reading comprehension with veritas prep  instead of me taking a course from one of these providers  i got to learn tips and tricks from all of them    read a full account of neilson s experience as an mbalauncher here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on demand option is not an overnight cram session forte recommends that women who elect the on demand format still allow ample time to complete the program   in general  we recommend setting aside three months for our gmat prep and another three months for our application prep   reads its website </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the on demand program is perfectly suited for candidates who are self motivated and disciplined but want a timeline and a structure to keep them on track   brooks says   of course  if candidates don t complete homework assignments or listen to webinars  the program is not effective  this is a structured program that calls for candidates to dedicate time to gmat study  self reflection and application preparation   the on demand program also offers participants a cost savings over the live version  though brooks is quick to point out that both are resource intensive and highly subsidized by forte s sponsors and program partners  the cost for participants in the live program is       the on demand program costs        the on demand program is offered at a discount because it doesn t include the same in person events that the in person launch includes   says brooks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>women who choose mbalaunch on demand do miss out on the community of peers formed as part of the live mbalaunch program   the community of peers is certainly a benefit to the in person program   brooks notes   that said  launchers in the on demand program can take advantage of our linkedin group to connect with other women in the program to network and support one another  our staff is also very happy to support and encourage on demand launchers and answer questions as they arise  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t miss forte virtual forum tomorrow in addition  forte also offers a range of other ways for women to develop community with fellow women who are navigating or just considering the mba application process  its forte forum series multi school recruiting events that include panels made up of current mba students and alumnae take place in more than a dozen cities each august and september  and tomorrow  april  th  forte will also be hosting a virtual forum for candidates to connect with its    sponsor schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i would also encourage all pre mba women to activate their free forte professional membership at fortefoundation org join   says brooks  doing so will keep women in the loop on these and other programs and resources forte offers </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  so you want to live in a french villa for business school </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a few weeks back in this space we included tips from a harvard business school  hbs  student on where to live on campus  this week  an insead mba student shares her dream of living in a french villa for business school and how she made it come true </paragraph>
    <paragraph>much like insead itself  the villa sounds like an international melting pot  home to    students speaking    different languages  as you might expect  fontainebleau offers a range of accommodations for insead students  but snagging a villa or chateau takes a little more work  have no fear  in the post that follows insead december     mba student winnie van tells you exactly what steps to follow  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  the  insead mba experience  student blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>friday from the frontline  so you want to live in a french villa for business school  by winnie van</paragraph>
    <paragraph>je suis arrive   fontainebleau  actually  i arrived a little over a month ago  but my new life at insead has flown by faster than a new york minute  it s only now that i have finally found a moment to stop and reflect on it all  so here goes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>let me invite you into my new home villa vivante </paragraph>
    <paragraph>villa vivante is an   th century home with eleven bedrooms  almost as many bathrooms  and two living rooms and kitchens  there are    of us fresh faced mba students living here at the moment  between us  we speak over    languages and come from all corners of the globe specifically from australia  me   america jordan  germany  france  canada  georgia  brazil  belgium  india and japan </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like many of my insead peers  i had my heart set on living in a nearby chateau or villa shared with other classmates  sounds ridiculous i know  but when else will we get the chance to live in a chateau in the french countryside  and when else will we get the chance to live under the same roof with ten other intelligent  fun  multi lingual and overachieving young professionals from ten different countries  for me  this is a once in a life opportunity that makes the insead mba experience truly unique </paragraph>
    <paragraph>accommodation was the first thing that i organized after i got accepted to insead  having applied in the second application round   and i highly recommend incoming candidates do the same  there are plenty of accommodation options in fontainebleau  but if you want to stay in a large shared house or chateau  then supply is limited </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it was a bit tricky finding information on shared housing options  so below is a short list of where some of my december     classmates are living to give you some guidance  in no particular order   bonne chance </paragraph>
    <paragraph>houses next to campus  within    min walking distance  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>club    maison royale marcel lods  separate apartments with some shared common areas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>houses near campus  within    min walking distance  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>villa vivante villa foch le parc</paragraph>
    <paragraph>houses   chateaus further from campus  within driving distance to campus  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chateau fleury chateau de montmelian chateau de courances shangri la le puits carre</paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan school s new logo results in lawsuit</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>cambridge  ma  knight ridder  earlier this week  the mit sloan school of management unveiled a new logo designed to bring the school s  mit brand  to the fore   after extensive study and collaborative effort  the logo was designed to reflect the smart  open  grounded and inventive nature of the school   read an official statement from the school   one of the distinguishing ways that mit stands apart from its peer schools is through our relationship with the institute a world class research institution  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>within hours of the new logo s debut  a lawsuit was filed by the letter  i   in a tersely worded statement  the letter  i  explained   i ve essentially been airbrushed out of the picture here  since when is  institute  less important than  massachusetts  or  technology   to put it bluntly  those words are simply meaningless without me  as if that s not insult enough  the fading  back to the future style memory of me is barely standing upright in this logo  what  am i drunk  let me be very clear here actually  no let me be highly opaque  </paragraph>

  <title>dare to share  mbas and the sharing economy</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>from ride sharing services like uber to fashion websites like rent the runway  it should come as no surprise that these so called  sharing economy  companies are changing the face of business  of course  when business changes  so does business education  in today s changing world  understanding the sharing economy and how to best use it could be key for new mbas as they navigate the workplace </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is the sharing economy  it is no coincidence that the growth of the sharing economy platforms that allow people to  collaboratively consume  by sharing goods and services is occurring as the number of millennials in the workforce increases  just as the economic recession of the     s resulted in a millennial push toward social entrepreneurship careers  those who grew up and attended school during this recession similarly adapted to a more socially conscious form of consumption </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the recent boom in the sharing economy is an understandable result of the millennial focus on minimizing waste and lowering costs  although the rise in the sharing economy is recent with services now allowing consumers to share anything from houses to musical instruments the instinct for humans to share has existed since primitive times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today  being a part of the sharing economy can serve a number of important purposes for a millennial  it can make services more affordable  such as the cost of an airbnb as opposed to a hotel  it can present an opportunity to earn extra income  such as selling goods through etsy  and it can reduce waste by facilitating secondhand purchases </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how will the sharing economy affect today s mbas  even though the idea of the sharing economy seemed preposterous    years ago  it is clear that the idea has caught on and will continue to grow  and interest is growing not only among consumers but among up and coming professionals as well  in a survey by businessbecause com     percent of surveyed mbas said they were interested in working for a sharing economy company </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an ever growing tech industry that sometimes seems to outpace itself  this forward looking interest from mbas is important  in the same survey     percent of mbas said that uber was likely to still exist in       whereas popular tech companies like instagram and facebook were    percent and    percent likely to exist  respectively  the long standing investment firm goldman sachs was only given a    percent likelihood of survival </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not only are mba students increasingly interested in sharing economy companies  but these companies are also hiring mbas at a growing rate  in australia  uber is even working alongside faculty at the australian graduate school of management to identify talented up and comers to join their team  the ride share app is expanding rapidly across the globe and has become a top recruiter for schools such as hec paris and insead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  knowledge is one more thing that can be shared within this new economy  and that means that today s mbas don t just have more opportunities to work for other people  they also have more opportunity to work for themselves  new services allow businesses to hire contractors in a freelance capacity  meaning students can make money from what they know without even leaving their living room </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sites like hourlynerd  which was established by a harvard business school mba  has a network of more than        freelance consultants     percent of whom have an mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how will the sharing economy affect business  it s understandable that the first critics of ride share services like uber were traditional taxi companies  even if the company claims its intention is not to completely overhaul the taxi industry  it s unavoidable that these new services will have a broad impact in the field  as products are more easily shareable  supply increases more rapidly than demand  causing prices to fall </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since it doesn t seem that the sharing economy is going away  it is important for companies to adapt and grow accordingly  and hiring millennials who understand the benefits of the sharing economy is just one way to stay ahead  companies should consider how to make their own products more shareable and see if they can join the sharing economy  rather than rebuke it  businesses might also consider finding ways to partner with sharing economy companies to benefit their product  such as ford s      partnership with zipcar </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is clear that many users find numerous benefits to being a part of the sharing economy  and while this shift in need may be worrisome as new graduates join the workforce  it s important for companies to consider why and what about the sharing economy is appealing to consumers  now more than ever  companies will need to hire young mbas who can help a business stay ahead of the curve of consumer interest  rather than fall behind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how is the sharing economy changing business education  with the growth of the global sharing economy valued in      at     billion and the concern it is bringing to some industries  understanding how and why sharing works is an increasingly important skill for mbas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some schools have even adapted their curriculum with this in mind  last year  the u k  s sharing economy trade body  seuk  announced a partnership with the skoll centre for social entrepreneurship at oxford university s said business school  together  seuk and oxford aim to develop the world s first  trustmark  for the sharing economy  laying down best practices and standards for sharing economy companies and consumers  u k business secretary sajid javid even commented on the sharing economy s vast potential to create new jobs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the united states  research on the sharing economy and its impacts is still divided  while the industry s growth is irrefutable  concerns like accessibility and the negative effects on existing industries are still real concerns  nevertheless  the partnership between oxford and seuk is an important step forward  especially as more mba programs face the question of how to adapt to this changing economy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in order for both consumers and companies to benefit most from this changing world  such partnerships are imperative to success  not only do today s mbas stand to benefit from the growth of the sharing economy  but companies stand to benefit greatly from these students  who possess a unique combination of yesterday s know how and today s ambition </paragraph>

  <title>integrated reasoning tip  more integral than you think</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the newest section of the gmat  the integrated reasoning  is often discounted by students as  less important  that the bigger beasts of the exam  the verbal and quantitative sections  but many mba programs have become more familiar with what the integrated reasoning examines and more than half of programs  particularly those that accept only   th percentile and higher students  are more closely evaluating the integrated reasoning as an indicator of applicant performance  the bottom line is that if you are looking to apply to a top tier school  then all components of the gmat are important </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what tends to be the biggest hurdle for students surrounding the integrated reasoning section is having a reasoning understanding what it covers  what the questions look like  and a few basic tips that lead to success </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the integrated reasoning section shows up after the awa and like the awa is    minutes in length  test takers are given    questions which can appear in one of four formats </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many of the questions can be multi part  with no partial credit given   a key  important point that many test takers do not recognize  that can make scoring well on the section difficult  considering the short amount of time given and the complexity of the problems </paragraph>
    <paragraph>however  there are some great advantages to the integrated reasoning section  it is not computer adaptive  unlike the quantitative and verbal sections of the exam  and is scored between a      meaning there is some room for error with the possibility of scoring a perfect   score </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the big key with the integrated reasoning section is to take full stock in how it can impact the rest of your exam  situated immediately after the awa means that walking away from the integrated reasoning unsteady can translate into a rocky start for more challenge computer adaptive components of the quantitative and verbal sections  when it is immensely important to feel decisive about problem set up and selection of answer choices </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a few tips for how test takers can prepare yourself for the integrated reasoning section  and some additional tips for success </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t fall into the trap discounting the integrated reasoning   consider it an integral part of your study plan </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the above gmat tip comes from veritas prep  since its founding in       veritas prep has helped more than         students prepare for the gmat and offers the most highly rated gmat prep course in the industry </paragraph>

  <title>admissions director reveals record darden round   results  encourages round   applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>sara neher  who heads admissions for the university of virginia s darden school of business  took to her video blog a few weeks ago to share details about round   results  talk about round    which was then still underway  and encourage applicants considering round   to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are very excited about those of you who have paid a deposit and decided to come to darden   she said in the february   th post  the group is very diverse  she continued  including students from chile to china  indonesia to finland and all over the united states </paragraph>
    <paragraph>record darden round   results in terms of women choosing to come to charlottesville she also shared that the group that had committed so far as part of round   was    percent women  bearing in mind that later rounds could cause that number to shift up or down  it is well above last year s entering class  which was    percent female  in a conversation with clear admit last summer  neher indicated that improving gender equity in the mba class and diversity in general was an important goal of hers  but that change had come slower than she hoped   we couldn t be more excited about all of those things and hope that those of you applying in round   will want to join them   she said in the post sharing the round   results </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the weeks since neher s post  hundreds of applicants have flocked to mba livewire to share their fate as part of round    consortium applicants began reporting offers of admission in early march  followed by a flood of acceptances last tuesday and wednesday  for those who are curious  here s a little of what livewire data told us about those who shared their darden round   admissions decisions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those who shared round   admissions decisions via livewire  the average reported gpa for those accepted was      and the average gmat was      those waitlisted reported the exact same average gmat score       but a slightly lower average gpa        those who didn t get in had a lower average gmat score       but the average gpa for rejected round   applicants  at       was actually very close to the average for those who gained admission and higher than the average for those placed on the waitlist  that some of these stats were so close across groups certainly suggests that other elements of the application process essay  interview  recommendations play a significant role in determining who makes the final cut </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because livewire data is subject to selection bias meaning that those who get in are far more likely to share the news than those who don t admission rates can be misleading  but it is worth noting that students reporting acceptances outnumbered those who were waitlisted by a factor of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>acceptances and scholarship money still to come in round   it s also not too late to apply in round   darden s final deadline is friday  april  th   i expect we ll have more scholarship funding available for round   than we have in the past  so i encourage you to apply i you are still trying to decide   neher said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also reminded applicants that darden provides feedback to those who don t get in   at darden  we give everybody personalized feedback over skype or the phone   she says   so if the worst happens and you don t get in you actually will still get feedback from an admissions committee member about how to improve your application for the following year  </paragraph>

  <title>hbs mba executive director weighs in on hiring of new gatekeeper</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  yesterday announced chad losee  hbs mba      as the next managing director of mba admissions and financial aid succeeding dee leopold  who has held the position since      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make sure to check out our initial coverage from yesterday for information on losee s credentials and background </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to learn more about losee and harvard s decision to select him as leopold s successor  we spoke with jana kierstead  executive director of hbs s mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  dee leopold has done such a wonderful job with the mba admissions process at hbs  building a reputation for innovation  transparency and fairness in mba admissions over the course of her    years in the role  in light of that  was there a particular strategy that you employed in conducting the search for her replacement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   we certainly used those tenants as part of the process  we conducted an open search and there were over     candidates involved  we hoped the next candidate would embody those qualities  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she then followed  saying that losee does possess these qualities and that his experiences as an hbs student would only lead to further improvements for applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for future candidates who fear that the admissions process will return to the opaqueness of pre leopold days  before she changed the game with her transparency and direct communication for now  such fears seem unfounded </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  how important was hiring an hbs mba for the role   was that a prerequisite for the job   it seems to have traditionally been the case </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   while this was discussed it was in no way a requirement  we spoke to many non hbs mbas  as a former hbs student   losee  has the ability to know the program and speak to the experience of what it is like to be a graduate  we know that he is passionate about hbs and business education  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it should come as no surprise that hbs chose to hire an alum for this position  as the insider knowledge of the admissions process certainly has its advantages  at the very least  hiring someone who is already familiar with the admissions process shortens the learning curve in managing the process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  given the length of leopold s career at hbs  how important was longevity  the likelihood that the person would stick around for the long term  as you contemplated hiring for this position </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   this was not necessarily something we looked for  but you always hope that when you find someone talented they will stay  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when we mentioned losee s age as part of the rationale behind this question  kierstead commented that while age in no way played a part in their assessment or served as a requirement for the position  his experience as a recent graduate certainly holds value in that he possesses knowledge on the current state of the admissions financial aid process  which will serve him in practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>his experience as an observer on the admissions board also grants him unique insight into the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  with leopold remaining part of the admissions team at hbs  in what capacity will she will she be assisting with the transition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   she will be involved in the transition as needed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she added that while leopold will be there if they need her  the training process and support will be primarily provided by a team of five senior staff members in the mba admissions and financial aid office </paragraph>
    <paragraph>given the stability in hbs  admissions office  the transition looks to be a smooth one  especially with leopold providing support </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  losee has been at bain   co since       has he remained active with harvard in any way over the last two years since he returned to bain </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   yes  he sat on the alumni board  which is a group of    alumni who help advise the school  dean and alumni body  he was also involved in recruiting hbs students for bain  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  other than losee s work with hbx and bain  were than any specific accomplishments of his that elevated him above the other candidates for the director of mba admissions position </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   i wouldn t say that it was any specific accomplishments  as much as specific qualities and characteristics  he has exceptional interpersonal skills  he is transparent and exudes confidence  which will serve him well in this position  he has excellent analytic and strategic skills  and he has a deep understanding of harvard s pedagogy  as demonstrated by his work developing the disruptive learning course with clayton christensen  hbs professor   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while it is unlikely to see any noticeable changes immediately  we are excited to see where losee takes things and how hbs continues to evolve the admissions process </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  a recent hbs alumna reflects on her business school experience</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the paths that people follow to business school can be remarkably diverse as can those they follow once they re done  mallory dwinal s interesting course to harvard business school  hbs  and beyond caught our attention  the recent hbs alumna  pictured above  far left  wound her way to the boston business school only after picking up a phd in education from the university of oxford and working for teach for america as a middle and high school spanish teacher at a charter school in washington  dc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the former rhodes scholar is now hard at work founding a school of her own oxford day academy a proposed public charter high school for the sequoia union high school district of san mateo county  california   slated to open in fall       its mission is to engage and develop intelligent  empathetic young leaders with the character  ability  and passion they need to create positive change in the world   her linkedin profile states </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students at oxford day will spend half of each school day in their local communities completing real world electives and internships  using oxford style tutorials  the school s teachers will help the students apply personalized academics to social issues that they care about   through this approach  our young people will develop not only deep content mastery  but also the open ended problem solving and interpersonal communication skills required to become impactful leaders for positive social change  both at home and around the globe   reads dwinal s profile  pretty cool  we think  our thanks to dwinal for letting us share her reflections on her time at hbs with clear admit s readers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   mba voices   the hbs student blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by mallory dwinal</paragraph>
    <paragraph>rc year is a lot more work than people are willing to admit  there s a ton of new material to cover and exercises to complete  especially during the first term  it s interesting and     percent manageable  but i didn t know to expect it and wasted a lot of time feeling like i was behind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make ec year work for you  and take the risks you want to take  there are tons of resources  financial and otherwise  to help you explore your interests find them and take advantage  i was trying to pull together financial and political support to open a new kind of charter high school in california  and hbs was very generous  from grants to covering plane tickets  to independent project  ip  credit for designing the school  they made it possible for me to chase that dream  they want to help  so reach out and advocate for yourself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the people from my class        who seem happiest with their time at hbs are the ones who were deliberate about prioritizing what was important to them and occasionally saying  no   you spend hours every day in open discussion with people you will still meet colleagues and make friends if you skip some parties  clubs  and networking events </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i wish i d let go of the guilt i felt about not going to every single social event  big  loud events were never my thing but i often felt like i was passing up an important part of business school  now  on the other side of hbs  i m very happy with the choices i made  and wish i would have owned them from the beginning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t be afraid to get off the beaten track  for family reasons  i split my time in rural areas between illinois and kentucky and did research remotely for an education non profit in new york  i also worked on school start up funding on the side  grants from harvard university paid for all of that work  there is no prescription for careers outside of consulting  banking  and a few other traditional business school fields  let yourself enjoy that flexibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i realized that i would probably never be happy working    in a routine role or    outside of k    education  this realization came through reflection over the course of two years of case discussions  simulations  and summer work  i ll be forever grateful for that opportunity to better know myself  clarity about the field you want to be in and the daily lifestyle you want from it is half the battle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the people are down to earth and caring in ways i never could have imagined  my dad passed away a few weeks after graduation  and the outpouring of love and support was indescribable  it s easy to get caught up in insecurities about how successful everyone there is  but you soon find they re also some of the most generous and compassionate people you ll ever meet </paragraph>

  <title>how nawmba supports businesswomen today</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this article originally appeared in its entirety on metromba com</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the national association of women mbas  nawmba  was founded in       and the organization has supported the education and professional development of many women since that time  with student and professional chapters of the organization located in regions all across the united states  nawmba has a large network of members dedicated to supporting female business professionals  to learn more about nawmba  i spoke with executive director virginia myers  who shared information about the organization s current offerings  as well as the exciting plans for future developments </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nawmba is a big supporter of educational opportunities  and the organization offers many webinars for professional development  some webinars are geared toward current mba students  whereas others are more suited to those who have already obtained an mba  this helps professionals continue their education after business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition  nawmba offers many professional development events throughout the year  for instance  chapters may host local and regional events to help provide leadership and networking opportunities for its members  and when a new chapter is established  the professional launch event brings together prominent businesswomen  corporate sponsors  and new members for great networking opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>furthermore  the yearly conference   career fair features high caliber speakers  networking opportunities  and a career fair with exhibitors from a variety of industries  the event takes place in a different city each year  most recently houston and the washington d c  metro area   which gives members the opportunity to network with women outside of their specific geographic location </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nawmba also provides the resources for women to further their professional education and meet with potential employers  the ability to interact with fellow members and other professional women may be the biggest benefit of joining nawmba </paragraph>
    <paragraph> most of what it provides is through networking with other successful women and professional development   said myers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>myers revealed that nawmba has exciting plans for a mentorship program in which both the mentor and mentee benefit from interaction </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the key thing i m interested in is to find a way for young people to also provide value to people who are mentors   said myers  the mentees could provide information about millennials  for instance  or offer insight into new technologies  furthermore  the mentors can act as a  personal board of advisors  to the younger women who are navigating different career phases </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nawmba s pilot program will ensure both parties benefit from a mutual flow of information  and that the mentees feel like they are also bringing something to the conversation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>myers discussed what skills mbas should master in order to stand out in the job market </paragraph>
    <paragraph> obviously  a lot of things vary in technical skills based on what your role is  but a few things are vital  regardless of what you re doing  being able to work cross culturally  as the world becomes smaller and economies more global  is important   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also stressed the importance of being able to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds  whether that person is from a different country  socio economic status  or even industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph> clear communication and being able to read people are vital   said myers  who noted that emotional intelligence  ei  skills are necessary in today s market  although electronic communication is the norm  more traditional means of reaching out are also critical skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph> communication is more electronic  true  but an important skill is often left on the table  where people need to be able to pick up the phone or write an actual paper thank you letter  a lot of people have social anxiety about interfacing with people in person  these are skills that can make people stand out in person regardless of industry   said myers  these people skills can be improved in sociable organizations such as nawmba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because nawmba is a relatively small organization  it is able to add programs quickly to meet market demand  the organization is implementing a lot of new and different programs in the near future  a revamped website is set to debut very soon  which will provide existing and future members access to helpful content  lastly  myers is planning to launch a podcast series to interview successful women about how they got where they are and their stories in general  overall  nawmba will continue to evolve and support the dynamic women who are leaders  entrepreneurs  and business executives </paragraph>

  <title>best business schools for social impact  part ii</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>on friday  we began our coverage of the rise of social impact among mba students and programs with a look at efforts underway at the yale school of management and nyu stern school of business  today  we continue our focus  looking at the countless social impact initiatives in progress at uc berkeley s haas school of business  sustainability measures harvard business school is implementing on its own campus  career resources for students seeking social impact roles at oxford university s said school of business and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas a heavy hitter in social impact arena the list of social impact initiatives at uc berkeley s haas school of business is long  the school s institute for business   social impact  ibsi   led by laura d andrea tyson  serves as an overarching hub for an array of programs and centers focused on finding creative solutions to some of the most challenging issues facing society and the environment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one  the center for social sector leadership  cssl   provides a wealth of resources for mba students looking to become leaders in nonprofit and public institutions  on campus  cssl initiatives include social sector solutions  s    which lets haas mba students hone their skills while providing valuable assistance as consultants to organizations in the nonprofit  public and social enterprise sectors  and haas board fellows  which gives students the valuable experience of serving on nonprofit boards </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an effort to provide social impact practitioners in the field with access to the same high quality leadership training afforded to haas mbas  cssl last year launched a first of its kind global initiative providing free online courses covering the foundations of what it takes to make a significant social impact  called philanthropy university  it features a unique curriculum developed and taught by haas faculty as well as industry leaders from mckinsey  hewlett  kiva and others  its seven foundational courses which cover topics including nonprofit strategy  global social enterprise and how to scale social impact  among others are available  for free  to individuals working in the very organizations where those skills are most crucial </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the institute for business   social impact is also home to the center for responsible business  crb   calling itself an  action tank   the crb is designed to unite students  faculty and the heads of companies to redefine business in ways that ensure a sustainable future  one of its most recent developments  the launch late last year of a human rights and business initiative combining coursework and outreach designed to help companies devise their own human rights strategies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the haas social impact fellows program  also launched last year  brings leading experts in the field to campus to mentor students  serve on panels and share their expertise with the school s programs  centers and faculty  among this year s seven fellows are marianne barner  a children s rights champion who for two decades worked to eradicate child labor in ikea s supply chain  paula goldman  global head of impact investing at omidyar network  which seeks to advance the impact investing industry  and jorge m  calderon  founder and managing director of premier impact management and investment consulting firm impact strategy advisors  isa  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and in less two weeks  haas will host its annual global social ventures competition  gsvc   taking place this year in thailand on april  st and  nd  gsvc is a unique competition founded by haas mba students in      that brings together teams from around the globe to learn how to scale their ideas for addressing some of the greatest social impact challenges of our day  thirteen leading business schools from the united states  europe  asia  africa and south america take part  and last year the competition drew     entries from almost    countries  successful social ventures such as kiva  revolution foods and ethos water got their start as part of the gsvc  this year s finalists range from u s  venture providing project management and financing for renewable energy projects in under served communities internationally to a taiwanese organization helping the elderly fight loneliness   sustainability starts at home at hbs harvard business school  hbs  claims to have pioneered the concept of social enterprise with the launch of its social enterprise initiative  sei  in       indeed  its more than    faculty members engaged in social enterprise and teaching have created more than     case studies on social enterprise that have been used to teach hbs mba students as well as mba students at other business schools around the globe  the sei s courses  cases and research center around two main pillars  nonprofit strategy and government and business for social impact  hbs students can choose from electives such as  entrepreneurship in the social sector  or  managing global health  and field courses including  social impact investing  and  social innovation lab   students lead the annual social enterprise conference  secon   which has grown since its launch in      to be one of the most popular conferences on campus  drawing hundreds of students  alumni and experts from the field  the school s new venture competition  nvc  also features a social entrepreneurship track  and teams in this track have made up a third or more of all entrants in recent years  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to the ever growing offerings within the sei  the school is also taking significant strides to ensure that it is incorporating sustainability into its own operations  by operating healthier  more energy efficient buildings  the business school has cut emissions on its campus by    percent and energy use by    percent  it has also implemented single stream recycling  composting in dining halls  reuse collection stations during move out and donation of leftover food to local shelters and food banks  as part of an mba student sustainability associates  ssa  program     first year hbs students contribute to ongoing initiatives and help educate their fellow classmates on the work being done and the ways they can play a role  and last spring  hbs brought composting to its commencement exercises for the first time ever </paragraph>
    <paragraph>social impact s global reach growing interest in social impact extends well beyond the business schools of the united states  in the united kingdom  oxford s said school of business reports that more than a third of its mba students are actively involved with social impact events at the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the skoll centre for social entrepreneurship at said provides a range of innovative social entrepreneurship electives designed to foster whole new approaches to social impact ones that extend well beyond any current regulatory requirements  one course   social entrepreneurship   innovation   looks at the subject matter through an international lens  another   social enterprise design   digs deep to understand the design and development aspects of social ventures </paragraph>
    <paragraph>said mba students can also take part in unique social impact projects  students can choose between the entrepreneurship project or the strategic consulting project  in the first  they are challenged to develop a business plan for a new venture providing a practical approach to addressing a real social issue  as part of the second  students work in teams of four as part of an eight week consultancy project over the summer  working with a range of organizations around the globe that the skoll centre identifies as worthwhile enterprises to benefit from the help provided by the mba student consultants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school also provides valuable resources to students looking to pursue social impact careers beyond graduation  last month  the skoll centre and the said careers centre teamed up to put on the fourth annual social impact careers conference  launch  thirty high impact speakers including penny fowler  head of the private sector team for oxfam  simon abrams  ey senior manager for climate change and sustainability services  and baljeet sandhu  founding director of migrant and refugee children s legal unit shared the varied paths they took to enter the social impact sector  the conference also included panels  workshops and career discussions designed to help interested students understand the less conventional recruiting processes used by some social impact organizations  as well as ways to make an impact in more traditional organizations  including multinational companies  government organizations and financial service providers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> launch aspires to help those seeking fulfilling  meaningful careers by exposing them to opportunities to listen to and learn from those currently pursuing positions in purpose led companies and enterprises   skoll center director pamela hartigan said in a statement   it s so refreshing to see so many organizations recognizing the valuable contributions mba students can make  especially as many mba students internationally are looking for careers which include creating positive social impact  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wave of the future  to save the future to be sure  the programs highlighted here are by no means a complete list of business schools infusing social impact and sustainability into their graduate management education  unc s kenan flagler school of business features a well regarded sustainability concentration  duke university s fuqua school of business offers students the opportunity to concentrate in social enterpreneurship and take part in multiple programs through its center for social entrepreneurship  case   and stanford graduate school of business is home to the center for social innovation  which brings together more than    faculty members who teach a wide ranging social innovation curriculum </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our recent profile of mit sloan alumnus omar mitchell showed how he s putting his mba to use to green the national hockey league  tuck mba students sat front and center at the december cop   paris climate summit  bringing what they d learned back to classmates in hanover  and the university of michigan s ross school of business boasts no fewer than     ways its mba students can make a social impact  from serving on its center for social impact student advisory board to taking part in the sanger leadership center impact challenge  designed to help support profitable ventures with social missions to serve the city of detroit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>student entrepreneurs  too  are increasingly focused on social impact  at northwestern s kellogg school of business  the zell fellows program which provides support to mba students who are trying to get ventures off the ground by graduation this year features multiple businesses with very strong social missions  as well as its first ever nonprofit  professor david schonthal  who heads the zell fellows program  also teaches the  discover  portion of the school s new venture creation track  a course in which students bring problems into the classroom that they are passionate about solving   having taught this class to i don t know how many groups of     students over the past four years  more and more every year and every quarter these problems trend toward things with high degrees of social mission  impact  community orientation   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for as long as social issues challenge our countries and our planet  we trust and expect that business schools and the mba students they teach will continue to rise to the challenge  responding with new and ever more innovative ways to confront and solve them </paragraph>

  <title>social impact and the mba  business schools where the two are synonymous</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph> oh  god yes   replied stacey rudnick when asked if interest in social impact is on the rise among the mba students she counsels  rudnick leads career services for the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin  but her emphatic reply is a standard refrain at any number of leading business schools when asked the same question </paragraph>
    <paragraph>student participation in mccomb s annual  business for good summit   held each february  has been steadily growing  rudnick shares  as has net impact chapter membership and overall career interest in social impact   and the higher interest is not just in non profits   rudnick says   students want to know  what is the ethos of the business that i am considering being a part of  is this a company that is doing good in the world  can i feel good about wearing its logo and its brand as a reflection of my brand   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the idea that the mba can prepare you not only to do well but also to do good has taken hold around the world in a big way  net impact  a nonprofit membership organization formed in      by a small group of socially minded mba students in san francisco has ballooned into an international organization of more than        members  boasting more than     chapters spread across business schools  undergraduate institutions and corporations  net impact s       business as unusual  social and environmental guide to graduate programs found that    percent of mba students surveyed cited learning about social and environmental business as a priority  sixty seven percent agreed or strongly agreed that their mba programs offered adequate career preparation resources for impact job seekers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why this increased demand for social impact focus among mbas  part of it is generational  as mccombs  rudnick points out   you have a generation of students that have been taught from a very young age about consciousness of the environment  energy savings  recycling  taking care of the planet  health and wellness as part of day to day living   she says   these students want the same values at the companies where they work  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to net impact  many of those students would take a    percent pay cut to work for an organization whose values align with their own     percent   to have a job that seeks to make a difference in the world either socially or environmentally     percent   or to work for a company committed to corporate and environmental responsibility     percent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and the focus on sustainability and social impact is expected to grow more and more mainstream not only among mba students but also at the companies they seek to work for  tuck school of business finance professor anant sundaram draws more students each year who want to take his class on business and climate change  which he says only makes sense   at many of the companies these students are targeting for post mba jobs  sustainability has become very central to how they operate   he says   we approach it in a very hard nosed way if you are the ceo of a shareholder value maximizing company  should you care about climate change and  if so  why  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>go into any major company and you will now find a chief sustainability officer  sundaram tells his students   not only is this a very senior manager in a policy making role  but it s also a new potential career path   he says   it s exciting  and it has all happened in the last decade in a significant way  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools leading the social impact charge so if student demand is high and the need for talent on the part of potential employers is poised for growth  which schools are best answering the call for an mba education firmly rooted in the tenets of social impact  we don t claim to offer a comprehensive ranking of the best schools for social impact   net impact devotes significant resources toward assessing the merits of different mba programs both in terms of sustainability and social impact and tells us the next  business as unusual  report is due out in fall        in the meantime  over the course of two articles  we re taking a deeper dive into some of what s on offer at a few of the schools doing it best  </paragraph>

    <author>Admissions Director Q&A</author>
  </authors>
  <title>admissions director q      a  maria pineda of umd s smith school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in response to our readers  interests  we are excited to have recently added a handful of new schools to the line up of mba programs we cover regularly on clear admit  the university of maryland s robert h  smith school of business is one of them  as part of our expanded coverage of smith  we caught up recently with full time mba admissions director maria pineda </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a    year veteran of the smith school s admissions office  pineda worked in undergraduate admissions in new york city before that   i wanted a change of scenery  so i was initially attracted to the smith school s location  with its traditional campus setting nestled next to a metropolitan city   she says  she s also a big believer in dean alexander triantis s vision of cultivating students to experience transformative change and then applying lessons learned to the workforce  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but it s the people that have kept her there   colleagues and faculty have the same mission  attract and develop students to be the next leaders  change makers or entrepreneurs   she says  the mba program s small class size also lets smith students build strong relationships while getting all of the benefits of a world renowned university   to me  one gets the best of both worlds  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>read on to learn more about just how the admissions process unfolds at smith  some of the most exciting things on tap  pineda s take on some of the shifts taking place in graduate management education and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what s the single most exciting development  change or event happening at smith this coming year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maria pineda  there are several things going on here at smith and at the university of maryland  both our women s and men s basketball teams are doing well  there is always a new building going up on campus  however  the most exciting thing to me is our internal curriculum alignment  outsiders probably do not see this  but this is exciting for us </paragraph>
    <paragraph>from admissions to faculty  from experiential learning to activities within the office of career services  we are aligning to ensure students are maximizing their two years here  we want students to experience everything they want in an mba program  but in the process of doing that  we want to make sure they are on track to meet their end goal  securing the job they want </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what is the one area of your program that you wish applicants knew more about </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mp  if i could pick one  i would say the tight knit community  here at smith  there is an innate desire to help others succeed  i know this may sound like a cliche  but it is true  for example  in the middle of finals week  one of our students who was transitioning from being a child advocate in a non profit organization to consulting was offered an interview for her dream internship  but she only had    hours to prep for it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after she told her career coach and one of her classmates about it  several people quickly volunteered to help  within a few hours  her classmates were conducting mock interviews and case based interviews with her  those who had contacts in the company and those who had worked for that same company prior to the mba helped her  she got the job  not only did she intern there  she was offered a full time position post mba with a lucrative salary and signing bonus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  walk us through the life of an application in your office from an operational standpoint  what happens between the time an applicant clicks  submit  and the time the committee offers a final decision  e g  how many  reads  does it get  how long is each  read   who reads it  does the committee convene to discuss it as a group  etc   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mp  once an application is submitted and all components are complete  an admissions committee member will read the entire file  this first reader will look at the applicant s strengths and weaknesses  noting anything unique and compelling  if the first reader sees fit and potential in this candidate  the applicant is invited to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before the in person or skype interview is conducted  the interviewer reviews the entire application including the first reader s notes adding other possible questions for the applicant  these can be simple  clarifying questions or they can be more complicated  like trying to understand the applicant s decision making process in regard to information found on the resume </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during the interview  our expectation is that we will gather more information about the applicant than what we have on paper  we want to get to know the real applicant  what are his her passions  what are his her goals  we intentionally ask questions that may seem challenging to make sure when one arrives in the fall  opportunities here align with the applicant s expectations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>post interview  the interviewer completes an interview report that includes any new information and confirms information found in the application  the interviewer is also asked to make a recommendation on the applicant  which can be admit  waitlist or deny </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after the interview write up is completed  the applicant is discussed in the admissions committee meeting  typically  after an interview  we will discuss an applicant within a week or two  yes  we sit together in a conference room and discuss each applicant  this committee is comprised of staff from admissions  student services and career services  everyone at the table has a vested interest in who we admit  so we have very honest dialogue about each candidate and his her potential  we spend hours every week in this meeting to ensure our outcomes align with our desired metrics and goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if an applicant is admitted  the application is sent to the umd graduate school  gs  for final review  the gs will look at the applicant s transcripts to review the academic record  international students do not have to submit transcript evaluations since all transcript evaluations are completed by the gs  they also ensure test scores are valid and that we are maintaining university of maryland standards in graduate level students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it usually takes a few days for the gs to get back to us  once they formally admit an applicant  we get to share the good news with the applicant  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>with so much buzz around this week s release of the      u s  news ranking of top business schools  we decided to devote this week s fridays from the frontline to a student perspective from one of the schools not even mentioned  because u s  news ranks only u s  business schools  some great schools elsewhere in the world get left out of the conversation  case in point  insead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>insead  with campuses in france  singapore and abu dhabi  boasts a remarkably diverse class made up of more than    nationalities  its accelerated    month program also appeals to students looking to gain an mba skill set without taking a full two years out from the work force  while not perfect for every prospective mba applicant  current student rayan dawud shares in the following post some of why insead  so far  feels just right for him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   the insead mba experience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when describing life at insead  students and alumni often talk about the world class courses and professors  the enriching extra curricular activities  and the outstanding career services  after an exciting kick off to the program these first two weeks with a variety of team building  orientation and preparatory activities  i thought it would be worthwhile to share some first impressions which i plan to reflect on at the end of the year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the people the insead mba class of december      is comprised of over    nationalities  my first reaction when i looked around the auditorium of my peers waiting for dean ilian mihov s welcome speech was to think about how incredible it was to experience this new meaning of the word  diversity  and to hear seven languages being spoken in my immediate vicinity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as i got to know my classmates  i realized that the diversity extended far beyond nationality  we had former doctors  lawyers  entrepreneurs  engineers  semi professional athletes  consultants  soldiers  bankers and even a member of an oscar winning movie production team  as someone who spent most of his life in one of the most multi cultural countries in the world and spent the past five years working for an international consulting company  i was extremely impressed with how well the admissions team had crafted our community  as dean ilian mihov stated in his welcome speech   everyone is a minority at insead  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the city   campus between talking to alumni and googling images  i thought that i had a pretty good idea of what to expect when i arrived  for the most part  i was way off </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fontainebleau is a bit of an oasis in the middle of the forest  but it s by no means a village  the town itself was much larger and developed than the sleepy french countryside i had originally pictured in my head  the school itself sits on a busy road about a    minute walk from the center of fontainebleau  and ch teau de fontainebleau  and neighbors several sports facilities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>although english is the language of instruction on campus  it doesn t hurt to pick up a few phrases in french to help with tasks like opening a bank account or getting a haircut  even if you fulfill your entry and exit requirements in two other languages </paragraph>
    <paragraph>orientation week activities if our first week was any indication of what to expect from insead  we re in for a challenging  exciting and rewarding year  the activities kicked off with campus tours and logistics sessions  how to apply for a residency permit  and was followed the next day  a friday  with a welcome address by insead dean ilian mihov and dean of degree programs urs peyer  the following monday many students sat for exemption exams where those with prior knowledge in specific topics could attempt to waive up to two core courses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>aside from logistics activities  the career center engaged with us right away to ensure that we began working with them to plot our career paths against our industry  geography and role preferences  we were immediately asked to schedule two meetings with our career advisors  one for cv review and one for career planning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>splash the splash program is a community service project whereby insead students take part in team based construction projects in insead s local communities  both in fontainebleau and singapore  we were divided into groups  by section  to build a playground at a local school for children with learning disabilities  pictured above   each section was tasked with setting and meeting specific goals with the support of the splash project team  as talented and diverse as we are  few of us had any real hands on construction experience  which made for an interesting day  the project was physically and mentally challenging  but it served as a crash course on how to communicate with a group of people from different backgrounds and work together on a tangible project  although the early bus and weather were challenging  the work was both personally and professionally rewarding and made many children happy  to get a closer look  check out this video </paragraph>
    <paragraph>start of classes by the time classes began  i was already so busy i had almost forgotten that i was here to study  my schedule for period   kicked off with  prices   markets  and  financial markets   valuation    although we had the option to sit for exemption exams in certain subjects and replace them with electives  the experience and levels of business acumen varied greatly among the classes  professors recognized this immediately and tailored their class discussions and assignments to strike a balance so that the more advanced students don t feel bored but the students new to business concepts don t fall behind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so far  so good here in fontainebleau  stay tuned in the coming weeks on how i landed at insead  the insead startup bootcamp and tips for a smooth transition when moving to fontainebleau </paragraph>

  <title>  things you need to know about the      u s  news business school ranking</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  reclaimed the number one spot in this year s u s  news   world report ranking of the nation s best mba programs after a two year stint in second place  stanford graduate school of business  gsb   which has passed the crown back and forth with hbs for more than a decade  took second  this year  tying with the university of chicago booth school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to the subtle movements of programs rising or losing a rank  there were quite a few surprises in this year s list  the clear admit team of admissions experts has sifted through the data and compiled a summary of seven key things to note this year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most shocking adjustment from      in terms of rank for an individual school was without a doubt nyu stern  which fell from the number    spot to number    this year  at first glance  it s hard to even imagine how this might happen  luckily   bob morse of u s  news was kind enough to publish a post explaining what caused this traditionally top    school to slide so precipitously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>morse explained that the reason for nyu stern s sharp decline was due to the fact that it did not submit its gmat gre scores on time    nyu  did not submit its data for the number of new entrants to both its full time and part time mba programs who provided gmat scores   he wrote  as a result  u s  news could not compute the school s average standardized test scores </paragraph>
    <paragraph>morse also states that while stern did provide the  omitted data points  later on  u s  news would not consider recalculating the scores  because  late is late </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while morse s blog post certainly possesses a whiff of passive aggression making one wonder if the drop in rankings wasn t more of a wrist slap  stern s inability to provide information by a deadline that every other school managed to meet does potentially raise questions about its administrative competence </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that said  the drop of nine spots on the list does seem harsh and  more importantly  incorrect  stay tuned to see whether or not this will damage the reputation of either u s  news or nyu stern  or both  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while a single position adjustment is no cause for alarm or debate about the difference in a program s worth  it marks the first time booth has ever outranked wharton  although the two did tie in      for fifth  and is also the first time the chicago school has secured a top three spot in the history of the u s  news rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to the rationale behind the program s movements on the list  chicago booth s climbing gmat average       and high employment numbers certainly played a part  furthermore  over the past few years wharton has been experiencing a mild slump on several rankings lists  most notably  financial times and businessweek   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>part of the problem may be rooted in wharton s admissions office and process   which can have a profound impact on a school s brand  in recent years  the school has experienced a high turnover of admissions directors  also  its reputation of having one of the most applicant friendly admissions processes has waned among potential students as well as alumni who are no longer called upon to interview applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the first time since       yale school of management  som  has ranked in the top ten  taking the number eight spot   its highest rank ever  the jump to number eight from last year s    spot is substantial  though not all that surprising upon inspection </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale has been making improvements on several fronts  in       the school hired dean edward snyder   the very same dean who sat at the helm of chicago booth during its meteoric rise in the rankings in the early     s  in addition  yale has been poaching high profile faculty from other schools over the last decade  notably  andrew metrick  professor of finance and anjani jain  current assistant dean  both were previously at wharton </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale has also achieved major progress with its facilities  completing the new edwards p  evans hall in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one more possible factor in yale s rise is its traditional strength and reputation as a leader in the non profit and corporate responsibility areas  which are in vogue with millennials </paragraph>

  <title>beyond business school  a sloan mba becomes the nhl s green guy</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>at clear admit  we are big believers in the intrinsic value of the mba not only in terms of graduates  earning power but also in terms of the myriad paths the degree helps prepare people to follow when they graduate  as part of a new series   beyond business school   we ll connect with alumni who have been out of school for a few years sometimes more to learn how they have gone beyond business school to make meaningful change in the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an architect with an mit sloan mba designs corporate social responsibility for the nhl</paragraph>
    <paragraph>how does an architect raised in florida who didn t even know how to ice skate come to lead corporate social responsibility for the national hockey league  nhl   for omar mitchell  an mba from mit sloan school of management proved the ticket </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mitchell knew from the age of four that he wanted to be an architect  and that s exactly what he focused on in college and graduate school  obtaining a master s in architecture from columbia university and going on to practice in a new york city architectural firm  the mid     s were boom years for real estate and  by extension  architecture   every half an hour there was a new building going up   mitchell says  at a firm focused on high rise residential and boutique hotels   we were flying high  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the financial crisis of      brought that to a screeching halt  forcing his firm to lay off    percent of its staff  even though mitchell was not among those let go in fact  he was being groomed to advance the unpredictability of architecture  so tied to the cyclical real estate economy  gave him serious pause   why would i want to subject my career to that kind of unevenness   he found himself asking himself  the idea of going back to school for his mba began to take hold </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  mitchell decided he wanted to study sustainability in real estate  his training as an architect had taught him that energy use in buildings accounts for    percent of energy use in the united states   if we can lower energy use in buildings we can make a significant difference   he says  in fact  that was the very pitch he used when applying to mit sloan   sloan s certificate in sustainability sealed the deal that sloan offers a certificate in sustainability was a major draw for mitchell   they have a curriculum established and developed specifically for folks with that interest   he says   and as a career switcher i wanted to make sure i would be able to message to the marketplace that not only am i an architect with technical expertise and an mba skill set  i also have this specialization   he says  other schools do feature joint programs  combining an mba with a master of environmental science or other advanced sustainably focused degree  but that didn t seem like the right route to him   going to the extreme of having another degree behind my name didn t seem necessary and i didn t need another year of grad school either   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mitchell felt like a kid in a candy store when he arrived at sloan  consulting  finance  technology  supply chain  operations so many paths presented opportunities where his skills as an architect would be transferable   architects are very rational and approach a problem in a very similar way to how you approach a business problem   he explains   you go from the biggest picture and drill down to the most intimate details like putting the guts of the building in you approach a business problem in the exact same way  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though consulting s rigorous and methodological way of approaching problems appealed to him  the expectation that you would learn entirely new industries in two to three months did not   i found myself much more at ease and comfortable being an expert within specific parameters  i began to realize that i wanted something defined  precise and in a single industry where i could leverage my architectural expertise  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so where does the nhl come in  of several summer internship opportunities mitchell had to decide between  one stuck out   the nhl had just started a program called  nhl green  and was taking one sloan student intern each summer to manage its environmental initiatives   he says  though just in its second year  the internship involved mitchell traveling to all of the different nhl arenas to evaluate their sustainability initiatives   it allowed me access to a lot of best practices and helped me see that what people were doing in the industry was trendsetting   he says   ice hockey is essentially played in a giant refrigerator so think about putting an energy star label on an ice rink  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> going into sloan i did not expect to go into pro sports at all   mitchell says with a laugh   what i realized is that professional sports have such a unique voice in telling an environmental sustainability story because sports have such a passionate following it presents a non political platform for spreading your message   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the roots of the ice hockey game  moreover  positions the nhl to advance a sustainability initiative in a truly authentic way  he adds   ice hockey players learn on frozen ponds or indoors where it costs a lot both in terms of money and energy to keep the rink cold   he says  fresh water scarcity is important to the nhl  climate change is important   they get it you can tell   says mitchell   the fans  the players  the league all understand   if my ponds don t freeze  i can t play   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>based on his findings during that summer internship  mitchell helped develop best practices for all of the nhl s clubs   they were very well received and showed the nhl as a premier leader in the space to advance this agenda   his internship landed him a full time job at graduation as the nhl s first ever director of sustainability   i essentially had a hand in writing my own job responsibilities   he says   because the job was so brand new it really gave me the opportunity to advance where the movement could head and how the nhl could be a leader    </paragraph>

  <title>gmat critical reasoning tip   mind the gap</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>let s start this post with a critical reasoning question </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when a group of people starts a company  the founders usually serve as sources both of funding and of skills in marketing  management  and technical matters  it is unlikely that a single individual can both provide adequate funding and be skilled in marketing  management  and technical matters  therefore  companies founded by groups are more likely to succeed than companies founded by individuals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before we dive into the answer choices  let s start by wrapping our heads around what this critical reasoning question is asking us  find the statement makes or breaks the conclusion of the argument   the gap in logic  the gmat likes airtight arguments  so they are looking for you to find and identify the hole </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to illustrate how we are going to mind the gap  let s start with a simple example </paragraph>
    <paragraph>matt is a lawyer   premise  matt went to law school   conclusion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sounds reasonable  right  of course  lawyers go to law school  well  not necessarily </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in some u s  states  paralegals who have been working for a period are eligible to take the bar exam and  if they pass  can become lawyers  same goes for patent attorneys  they are often required to have a terminal degree in engineering or science in combination with field experience to sit for the patent exam  many patent attorneys never darken the doors of a law school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alas  we have found the hole </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in concluding that matt went to law school  the assumption is made that all lawyers go to law school  without the argument stating that all lawyers go to law school  the conclusion that matt went to law school is not necessarily true   the argument falls apart  if there were multiple choice answers to the question  the one that references that assumption that all lawyers must attend law school would be the correct one to select </paragraph>
    <paragraph>easy enough  right  answering our practice question should be a piece of cake </paragraph>
    <paragraph>heading back to our question  when evaluating the hole  most students are going to fixate on the  single  versus  group  situation  but of course  a company started by a group of folks with varying skills is going to be more successful  you need a ceo  a cfo  and director of marketing  the head of it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>anyone ever heard of jeff bezos  michael kittredge  walt disney </paragraph>
    <paragraph>those test takers are going down the wrong path  the assumption being made is  actually  that good marketing  management  and technical skills equal success </paragraph>
    <paragraph>turns out  both mitt romney and donald trump have a few failed businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in theory  these types of critical reasoning questions should be as simple as our lawyer example  but clever wording and neatly disguised answer choices enough many gmat test takers to take the road often taken  where they select an incorrect answer choice  plus  they let the gmat prey upon assumptions they have made based on knowledge they have outside of the exam </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t be one of those test takers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the key to being successful on these questions to not only mind the gap  but aggressively  anticipating not only that a gap is already there  but that it looks like platform     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now that we have figured out truly the assumption on which the argument rests   that marketing  management  and technical success result in business success  let s evaluate the answer choices </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a  a new company is more likely to succeed if every founding member contributes equally to the company s initial funding than if some members contribute more funds than others </paragraph>
    <paragraph> b  some founding members of successful companies can provide both funding and skills in marketing  management  or technical matters </paragraph>
    <paragraph> c  new companies are more likely to succeed when their founders can provide adequate funding and skills in marketing  management  and technical abilities than when they must secure funding or skills from nonfounders </paragraph>
    <paragraph> d  founders of a new company can more easily acquire marketing and management abilities than technical abilities </paragraph>
    <paragraph> e  a new company is more likely to succeed if its technical experts are also skilled in management and marketing than if they lack management or marketing skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the correct answer is  should be  very obvious    c  is the only option that addresses that marketing  management  and technical skills equal success </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking for further guidance on how to mind the gap in critical reasoning questions  check out this video from brian galvin  director of academic programs  at veritas prep </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>

  <title>gmac debuts new executive assessment test designed specifically for emba candidates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>six leading business schools are piloting a brand new entrance exam designed specifically for applicants to executive mba  emba  programs  called the executive assessment test  ea   it was developed by the graduate management admission council  gmac   maker of the gmat  as an alternative to the gmat or gre that would require less preparation time while still allowing emba programs to effectively evaluate applicants  business school readiness </paragraph>
    <paragraph> because you are busy juggling the demands of work and home  the assessment is easy to schedule  short in duration and requires only modest preparation   reads the gmac website  the six schools participating in the ea launch are columbia business school  london business school  the university of hong kong  hku   the university of chicago booth school of business  insead and the china europe international business school  ceibs   gmac expects it to open to the rest of the industry a year from now </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because it is designed as more of a diagnostic assessment of analytical abilities than a rigidly scored exam  test takers should only need to plan for modest preparation in advance of taking the ea  ninety minutes in total  the exam will be divided into three    minute sections integrated reasoning  math and verbal  together  the sections are intended to measure skills critical both in an emba candidate s career and classroom experience  such as higher order reasoning  critical thinking  analysis and problem solving </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond serving as an evaluation tool for schools  results of the ea test are also intended to help prospective emba students identify which areas they might want to spend time focusing on before beginning their business school program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac developed the test with extensive input from peer schools  not only to provide a simpler option for test takers but also to more accurately measure the more extensive professional knowledge emba students bring to classroom   while the gmat is a strong predictor of success in core courses for our full time mba program  we discovered it was not as accurate a predictor of success for emba students   michael robinson  senior associate director of mba admissions at cbs  wrote in an announcement about the new offering   we believe the executive assessment will become the new standard for all executive mba programs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the exam will be administered at the same     gmac centers worldwide where the gmat exam is currently offered  prospective emba applicants who have already taken or still want to take the gmat or gre have that option those scores are still valid as part of the emba admissions process </paragraph>

  <title>global private equity challenge  oxford said vs chicago booth</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last month  students from two of the world s leading business schools took part in the first annual meeting between teams from the oxford said and chicago booth schools of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dubbed the oxford chicago global private equity challenge  this new finance competition brought representatives from the private equity institute at oxford said and the polsky center for entrepreneurship of chicago booth together for three days of discussion and case competition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the challenge is designed for students who are looking to develop careers in private equity and investment banking  participants from both institutions take part in a case competition where they are tasked with assessing the potential for a leveraged buyout of a publicly listed company and compete for a cash prize </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>well  it wasn t easy  to participate in the challenge  booth students had to create a team  prepare a proposal and financial model based on cases that were posted early in the fall term  and apply  from that pool of applicants  a selection of teams were asked to interview with a panel of private equity investors and academics  following the interview process  three teams were selected to compete in the chicago booth semifinals  the best booth team was sent packing for england where they went head to head with the top team from oxford </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  oxford students who wished to participate in the challenge had to take part in the bridgepoint private equity challenge  which aimed to find the smartest assessment of leveraged buyout opportunities in the united kingdom  andreas angelopoulos  executive director of the private equity institute and program director of the finance lab in oxford said  then chose a team of five from more than     students that participated in bridgepoint and mentored them for five weeks in the run up to the oxford chicago global private equity challenge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>both teams selected for the finals received a new list of possible cases and chose one to prepare a proposal for  the oxford team looked at moleskine  an italian notebook company  and put forward an investment thesis that looked at growth scenarios  marketing transformation  financing  valuation and returns  meanwhile  the team from chicago booth looked at the american gym company planet fitness  teams presented their final proposals to a committee comprised of chicago booth and oxford alumni </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to angelopoulos  the challenge was much more than just  well  the challenge  saying </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the three day program began with angelopoulos and tiago dias  corporate finance vice president of altice  presenting a seminar on acquisition finance modelling  this was followed by a presentation of a private equity case on the lbo acquisition of teamsystem in italy by luigi bartone  director of intermediate capital group  luca bassi  managing director of bain capital  federico leproux  ceo of teamsystem  and roberto ippolito  managing partner of riverrock  ippolito also happened to be an alumni of chicago booth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>then  after presenting their proposals to the investment committee panel  the teams had an opportunity to attend the   th annual private equity forum in oxford  which brought together academics and investors like blackstone gso  goldman sachs merchant bank  ardian  advent and cdc group to discuss challenges and opportunities facing the private equity sector </paragraph>
    <paragraph>humphrey battcock  managing partner of advent international  said </paragraph>

    <paragraph>the apartments are great  they are not high end  but are very well maintained  with      service  the kitchens  mostly kitchenettes  are equipped with a fridge  stove  dishwasher and sometimes a microwave  and are  a fair size to allow for cooking great meals  the apartments are not furnished so you have the ability to create your own home from the provided space  and ikea is only a    minute drive away   utilities and heat are included  the leases are approximately a year long for the first year  they start at varying dates and all end on june   th   for the second year they re for a whole year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs is a residential campus  how does that impact student life </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this means hbs is not only a school  it s a community  you have an opportunity to get to know your classmates  and their families  in a deep and real manner  these are the people you study with  live next to  eat with  party with  and lean on  for me  the impact is really feeling a part of something  hbs is far more than a place where you go just for an education  or a place you go to class in  its the place you meet new friends that over time  become your extended family </paragraph>
    <paragraph>is it possible for couples and families to live on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>definitely  living on campus amplifies the partners  part in the hbs community and family  the inclusive environment of hbs makes partners an integral part of the section  and living on campus allows them to attend more gatherings and partake in more activities with less logistics involved </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for families  the effect is even greater  hbs has a very active families club called crimson parents that arranges activities for families and children in a wide variety of ages  arranging everything from baby massage classes  through apple picking trips  and all the way to holiday parties   crimson parents also provides a resource for assistance from finding babysitters to meal trains when required  and creates a support structure for families that are away from their extended families </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how does the housing lottery work </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is one lottery for hbs housing that results in a dorm room offer being made in one of the rounds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is another lottery for harvard university housing  huh  apartments  both on and off campus  that result in assigned view and select windows  where applicants go online to look at available housing and can choose one  each lottery has a swap time at the end of it  students are encouraged to sign up for both lotteries to give them more of a chance  but if any student is coming with a partner or children  they can look at the huh apartments only  huh also gives priority to applicants with one or more children </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what advice would you give prospective students new admits as they think about their living options at hbs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make sure you understand what you really need  all options are good  it just depends on your personal requirements and preferences  if you can  come on campus for asw to see for yourself and get a better understanding of the options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for more information about housing options at hbs you can read the following blog posts </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit and prodigy finance host webinar on financing your mba abroad</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>late last month  clear admit teamed up with community funded loan provider prodigy finance to share information and answer questions as part of a free webinar for prospective mba students looking to study outside of their home country </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we were pleased to draw    registrants for the february   th webinar  and participants took part in a lively q a session at the conclusion of the presentation  today we re going to recap some of the key points for anyone who may have missed out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>financing your mba abroad poses specific hurdles the costs associated with pursuing an mba program at a leading business school today routinely reach six figures  which means that financing the degree can pose a significant challenge to almost any prospective applicant  but students looking to study outside the country of their nationality or residence face unique issues that can make financing business school even more difficult </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that s because traditional banks are reluctant to lend across borders  since doing so can make it harder to track and enforce loan repayment  many u s  banks  for example  won t lend to foreign students without a u s  co signer someone local the banks can go after to recoup their debt if the borrower fails to repay  and the same is true for u s  students looking to study in  say  spain </paragraph>
    <paragraph>enter prodigy finance a decade ago  a few mba students at insead found themselves facing precisely this predicament  realizing that they were probably not alone  the students came up with a solution  launching prodigy finance in       their answer  a community funded model in which international students attending mba programs abroad receive loans made possible by investments from alumni of the school they attend </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for instance  alumni who attended insead will invest in a bond to fund current insead students  additional investors often include the business schools themselves  the school community and other investors or institutions interested in higher education or social impact  by investing in these current international students  they are also investing in the value of the given school s mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today prodigy has grown to have offices in new york city  cape town and london  funded more than       mba students worldwide and given out more than      million in loans  more than     countries are covered as part of prodigy finance loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what does it mean for borrowers  this was at the heart of the february webinar  after an intro by clear admit co founder eliot ingram  prodigy finance student relations manager zach hirschfeld outlined some of the key benefits for mba students who receive loans through prodigy finance </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for starters  no cosigner  collateral or guarantor is required for any prodigy loan  loan recipients have a six month grace period after graduation before loan repayment starts  while the loans do carry an administrative fee  equal to     percent of the total loan amount   it is amortized over the lifetime of the loan  with nothing due up front  loans for students attending business school in the united states are disbursed in u s  dollars  finally  there is no fee or penalty if you decide to pay off your loan early instead  you ll simply benefit from a lower overall repayment expense thanks to savings on interest </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hirschfeld also drilled down into some of the things prospective applicants need to think through as they begin to contemplate financing their mba  first  says hirschfeld  consider your budget  most schools  financial aid offices provide an official cost of attendance figure  which is a great starting point  but also consider how you ll travel to and from the campus  where you plan to live during school and how many social events or trips you hope to take part in while a student  he suggests   try to talk to a student who is already at the school they will give you the best first hand perspective of how much it actually costs to attend so you can make a really informed decision about  in total  how many funds you need to properly afford the duration of the program   suggests hirschfeld </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the next step in the process is to take stock of your available funding sources from savings to scholarships  company sponsorship to help from friends and family   once you have taken this into consideration  sometimes you will need to fill the gap that remains through a loan   hirschfeld says   if you come to the conclusion that you will need to borrow either a little or a lot of that amount  prodigy can be a really great resource for you  </paragraph>

  <title>mba livewire lights up with stanford gsb dashed hopes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba livewire has shown interview invitations trickle in from round   applicants to stanford graduate school of business over the past couple of days  but it was today when the flood gates opened to let a wave of disappointed applicants spill forth sharing their news of rejection </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite some grumblings about how mean it was of stanford to reject people on march  th international women s day the school  in fact  was simply adhering to the date it had always said it would release round   applicants from consideration  had that date been a week later  applicants of irish descent might just as well have grumbled  and a week earlier could have upset the welsh </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those who are wondering  the pool of applicants invited to interview in round   by stanford gsb boasted an average gpa of      and an average gmat score of      the stats for those who didn t make the cut couldn t really have been much closer to identical  those reporting rejection today had an average gpa of      and an average gmat score of      and yes  those figures have been triple checked  for every round   applicant who reported an invitation to interview  two more faced rejection </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always with our mba livewire analysis  we should stress that the sample size is small and likely subject to some selection bias </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the commentary about international women s day  the notes and comments people have shared amid the wave of rejections today has ranged from understandable disappointment to relief that the wait is over to gracious encouragement for those prepping to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some of our faves  </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>as reflected in the remarkably parallel stats of the candidates invited to interview and those rejected today  strong scores and grades are a requirement to get into stanford gsb  but they are by no means a guarantee </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a hearty congrats to those who did receive an invitation to interview  don t forget clear admit s stanford gsb interview guide and the interview archive  both of which can help you prepare  best of luck </paragraph>

  <title>the growth of international indian mba students</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it shouldn t be a surprise to anyone that top mba programs are being flooded with applications from indian candidates  according to the graduate management admission council  the number of indians taking the gmat increased by nearly    percent from      to       and more than half of those gmat scores were sent to american business schools  in fact  from      to      a total of        indians took the gmat  third in the world behind the united states          and china          </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though most u s  business schools do not offer applicant information by geography  data gathered through alumni networks by the economic times provided some insight  for example  northwestern s kellogg school of management admitted    indians last year  and for the      application year its intake is greater than     the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  too  has increased the number of indian mba students it admits from approximately    to    last year to approximately    to    this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while schools such as harvard business school and wharton did not reveal their applicants  geographical backgrounds  kate smith  kellogg s assistant dean of admissions and financial aid  noted that india is a focal point for the school   we have seen many strong applicants from this region   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at some prominent business schools  international applicants now outnumber those from the united states  for example  at washington university s olin school of business     percent of candidates in      were non u s   but only    percent of the entering class was made up of international students  this is a large discrepancy and can make it difficult for indian mba applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these indian candidates are at a severe disadvantage for the best mba programs in the united states  many of the top schools are over saturated with indian applicants  so much so that it can be difficult to stand out  the average indian candidate has a high gpa  high gmat score and a background in computer software  while this is impressive  for indians it can mean that they are just one in the crowd </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indian applicants face far higher rates of rejection  for example  acceptance rates for indian applicants can be as low as   percent  while u s  applicants have an acceptance rate four to five times higher at    percent  there are many reasons for this discrepancy  ranging from the admissions committees  need to craft a more balanced and diverse class to language difficulties faced by some non u s  applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many indians are seeking mbas in the united states due to rapid growth back home  even if an indian already has an mba from an indian institution  he or she may apply to u s  programs to obtain a highly regarded american degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an mba from an american business school can help the indian young professional gain a high demand job as a skilled manager  setting him or her apart from the overwhelming number of technical and engineering focused applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another reason indians are heading to the united states for their mba is the perceived difference in educational quality from indian business schools  only one school  the indian institute of management in ahmedabad  made it onto the economist s ranking of mba programs this year  were it placed   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the big issue is that most indian business schools still struggle with teaching techniques that go beyond basic grading and assignments  unlike american schools  there s less focus on hands on experience  which puts graduates at a significant disadvantage  also  graduates only make         post graduation  about a quarter of the salary of graduates from the university of chicago booth school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the fact that indian mba applicants face steep competition  they also face the major obstacle of paying for their mba in america  thankfully  there are many top u s  business schools that offer mba scholarships specifically for indians students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  the average merit based scholarships given to indian students have increased by nearly    percent this year over last year at duke s fuqua school of business  yale school of management has also increased its indian scholarships </paragraph>
    <paragraph> round three of the admissions cycle is still in progress  and we don t release enrollment figures until the new class arrives  but overall  applications to yale have increased by about    percent year on year  and applications from india have increased too  all applicants are automatically considered for merit scholarships  and the school has increased its scholarship support overall   bruce del monico  yale som assistant dean and director of admissions  told the economic times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for where indian applicants should head to school if they re looking for a scholarship or fellowship  there are quite a few schools that offer financial aid for indian mbas  notably </paragraph>

  <title>career services at georgetown s mcdonough school  q a with doreen amorosa</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>five years ago georgetown university s mcdonough school of business convinced doreen amorosa to take over as associate dean and managing director of career services  despite the fact that she lived in new jersey  not washington  dc  and didn t plan to move  she did commute for the first few years  returning to central jersey to spend weekends with her husband  but they ve since sold that home and divide their time between dc and cape may   the center of the universe has shifted a little bit   she says with a laugh </paragraph>
    <paragraph>amorosa had spent all of her career working in new york city  including the first    years with merrill lynch  in her later years at merrill  she migrated into running recruiting and retention for the firm  discovering that was what she really loved  she went on to head recruiting for a range of other firms  including american express  traveling to the mcdonough campus in that capacity to recruit mba students  that s how the school recognized her talents and eventually wooed her to its side of the fence </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  amorosa reveals some of the latest techniques and technology she and her team have deployed to prepare mcdonough mbas for success whatever their chosen career path  read on to learn more about the jump start mcdonough students get on the job search process   hint  things get rolling in mcdonough s mba career center long before classes start   and don t miss the the new online community tool that connects current mcdonough students with alumni around the globe in a truly innovative way </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a proud hoya who earned her own b s  in management at georgetown  amorosa also shares how the jesuit ideal of  men and women for others  shapes not only the school  its students and its alumni  but even mcdonough s career services offerings   clear admit  what s new at mcdonough s mba career center since we spoke last </paragraph>
    <paragraph>doreen amorosa  a lot  we have rolled out several innovations in career services recently that i would love to talk about  first  we have put a set of protocols in place that begin as soon as a student accepts our offer  as soon as students say they are coming to mcdonough in the fall  we invite them to take part in our mba career ignition summer webinar series  which is designed to set them up for success in their eventual job search process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of this series  incoming students are tasked with a number of different deliverables  while not mandatory  taking advantage of them is definitely going to be in the students  best interests </paragraph>
    <paragraph>essentially  there are four deliverables on incoming students  plates between june and july  first  we ask them to complete an accomplishments record  which becomes the basis for the stories they are going to tell as they talk about their experiences and begin their elevator pitch development  the second deliverable is a value proposition  we want them to be able to formulate an answer for the question of  why am i going to get an mba and what am i going to do with it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>third and this was entirely new this past fall we have asked students to create an mba career inventory  more and more there is a need by incoming students for what we call  career clarification   they come in the door  and they are not really sure what they want to do or how to get clear on that  at the same time  employers want access to students earlier and earlier and earlier  so the sooner students can get clear about what they want to do  the more successful they are going to be in terms of their internship search  to this end  we have created an in house self assessment tool that helps students assess    different functional roles  we have to help them think multi dimensionally they should be thinking about not only an industry focus but also a functional focus  the tool is designed to help them make an informed choice about what direction they will pursue </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the tool provides a one page questionnaire about each of the    functions  where do you have experience  what are your interests  what s your prior background  your temperament  say a student has an interest in consumer behavior  using the tool  he or she can help determine some developmental goals and gauge how they will mesh with the position  students can take as many or as few of these functional inventories as they want  what do i know about private equity  it consulting  cpg marketing  universally  the feedback we have received is that these new tools prove really helpful because they open up a window for students of what s possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph>everyone knows about consulting  finance  marketing but often they don t realize all of these other functional specialty areas  many of which present possibilities they never thought of before  it s been a really big win for us in terms of helping incoming students get a sense of what s possible and create the tools needed to take it to the next step </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the final deliverable happens in july with the creation of their resume  so when they start school at the beginning of august  they have done all of that self reflection already  all of that work is done before they even get to campus  we have run the summer webinar series beginning in june for the past four years and found it to be very useful students tell us they are so happy to have the opportunity to do this work ahead of time when they could really focus on it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that s a best practice i brought with me to mcdonough from the corporate world  between when you give someone a job offer and they start employment  you have great mind share  and with students  since they haven t started school yet  we actually find we get better mind share now than we do when they hit the campus in august </paragraph>

  <title>round   at kenan flagler school of business  admissions director weighs in</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>for the right candidates  applying in round   to the university of north carolina s kenan flagler school of business is by all means a worthwhile endeavor  the school s admission director assures us  we spoke yesterday with sherry wallace  who has led admissions at the chapel hill business school for close to two decades   every year we get as many as    to    percent of our applicants in round    and we fully intend to admit from this round   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  the school will continue to accept applications beyond the march   th round   deadline if the class is not set at that time  and most of the time it s not  wallace says   we don t want to discourage anyone who happens to find us late to apply even then   she says  to be clear  there are not a ton of seats still available after the round   deadlines  she says   but for the right candidate who finds us late  there can definitely still be a spot  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school s final round is positioned by design relative to the enrollment deposit deadlines for the second and third rounds  wallace explains  kenan flagler s deposit deadline for rounds   and   is april   th  as it is for many schools   so by the time we are making decisions on round    we know what we have yielded for the other three rounds   she says   i can remember maybe one year in the    or so that i have been doing this when we were overflowing and couldn t make any offers in round     but she absolutely does not want anyone to believe that there is no chance of admission in round     wouldn t that be kind of mean to offer a round if no one would be accepted   she asks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wallace also wants to address concerns on the part of international applicants about applying in the final round   i can say that international students who are admitted in our last round should have no problem getting visas we haven t had that be an issue   she says   now  if they don t react right away if they sit on the offer for a while then they may have issues   she says   but as long as they act as soon as they get a late round acceptance  they should be fine  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wallace is very pleased with application volume so far  noting that it has matched last year s volume  resulting in a second consecutive year of double digit increases   our domestic pool is slightly bigger this year  but we still also have really strong candidates from outside the u s    she says   i am happy with the quality of the students who have accepted thus far and have every reason to believe we will have a really strong class   she continues   if i were looking and thinking about whether i might want to join kenan flagler  i would think this is a great year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t miss our latest admissions tip for more on applying to business school in the final rounds </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  kellogg student reflects on mba recruiting process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week s fridays from the frontline comes to us from kellogg school of management second year mba student rohan rajiv  a regular contributor to kellogg s full time mba student blog  in a series called mba learnings  rajiv has chronicled his progress through kellogg s mba program  in today s post  he shares candidly about mba recruiting  which he says  is probably the single hardest piece of the graduate school puzzle   peer pressure and self doubt can combine to make the process of landing a post mba job fraught with stress  read on to learn some of rahiv s tips for staying cool under pressure   the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   the inside perspective   kellogg s full time mba student blog   mba learnings  the recruiting journey through self doubt the mba learnings series has two objectives  the first is to develop the discipline to synthesize and share some powerful concepts i ve learned while at school  with about four and a half months left at school  i m hopeful that i ll continue to do this after i graduate as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the second has been demystify what the journey is really about  i have been surprised at the lack of really good resources on this topic  and i hope to have a definitive list of eight to    posts on the topic that will be helpful to prospective  admitted and current students after i graduate  i ve listed five posts i ve written so far on the topic at the bottom of this post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today s topic is one that aims to demystify an important part of the mba experience finding a job or to use a one word description  recruiting  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my experiences both as someone going through the journey myself as well as someone attempting to help others through the experience have shown that recruiting is hard  it is probably the single hardest piece of the graduate school puzzle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is easy to laugh this is almost as privileged a place to be when it comes to finding a job  some of the best employers around the world make it a point to invest hours and days on campuses to talk to students about what life at their firm is like  all definitely true  but i don t think life gets any easier when you are bill gates  sure  you take away worries about shelter  sustenance and the like </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but the kind of challenges you face are in no way inferior to everyone else  in fact  it is my belief that challenges of the mind tend to be the hardest to talk about and deal with  as evidence  i have learned that students from the law school and business schools at most universities are the biggest users of on campus counseling services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think this part of the experience is particularly hard for three reasons </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   every person going through the process has a track record of success that got them into school  it feels natural to expect this to work well with relative ease  and  in a few cases  it does  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   the fact that you re going through it with so many classmates some of whom do better than you by balance of probability increases the pressure </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   and finally  most of these folk have received really bad career advice in the past that has led them to believe that there is that one  dream company  out there for them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in my case  i think the peer pressure involved with the experience definitely made me question my own competence and abilities more than once  i made a couple of unusual choices and those came back as questions did i do the right thing  what if i had done things differently  it also took what seemed like ages for any progress to come through </paragraph>

  <title>decline of the unicorns  a startup tale </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in advance of his upcoming course   how to finance and grow your startup   without vc   set to start    april       london business school s blog recently spoke with management practice in marketing and entrepreneurship professor john mullins to gain insight into why we are starting to see a sharp decline in the value of so called  unicorn  start ups   mullins explained at a recent regent s park campus event that a combination of hysterical marketing  excessive funding  and untenable appraisals have caused the so called unicorns businesses valued at more than    billion to go extinct  hence the term  unicorpse  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mullins cites social messaging app snapchat and online marketplace app living social as two prime examples of the  unicorpse  phenomenon   venture capitalists were enamored with  living social s  ability to support local businesses through daily deals   mullins explains to the london business school blog   the company explored going public but living social never filed for an initial public offering and its workforce  fell  from some       at its peak in      to around     today   living social s more imposing nemesis groupon eventually went public to the morose tune of an     ipo discount </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mullins hopes to use the unicorn unicorpse phenomenon as a case study to debunk the notion that budding entrepreneurs need only seek out venture capitalists as their sole fund raising tactic  he explains that the behavior of doing so is motivated by a myth the venture capital community perpetuated due in part to the overwhelming value this method has generated in the past </paragraph>
    <paragraph> taking the time to find the right type of capital to match the specific needs of your company can be a much better idea   mullins elaborates in the london business school blog  customer funding  mullins argues in his      book the customer funded business  wiley   is a more stable yet highly misunderstood alternative to venture capital funding  richard branson  bill gates  and michael dell all know the reality  mullins posits   it s about time entrepreneurs started to question how appropriate vc funding is for their business and look to alternatives  like their customers  instead   otherwise we ll have mass extinction to look forward to </paragraph>

  <title>there s no biz like demographically diverse show biz</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>columbia business school  cbs  s website recently published new research that offers tangible solutions for increasing workplace diversity  this is an especially hot button topic in the realm of show business ever since the      oscars contenders were widely decried throughout the media as demographically homogeneous </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>the cbs research group confirmed a number of obvious assumptions regarding workplace diversity but uncovered specific strategies that both impeded and fortified diversity </paragraph>
    <paragraph> demographically diverse groups make better decisions and produce more innovations  because they bring in different perspectives   explains cbs professor katherine phillips  co author of the study </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite slightly higher rates of conflict  which can  impair group functioning and performance   diverse workplaces generally inspire greater efficacy and creativity while spurring economic growth on both national and global scales </paragraph>
    <paragraph>adam galinsky  lead author and fellow cbs professor  warns that  skin deep  diversity company policies are ineffectual without discrete strategies for implementation   the benefits depend not just on encountering unfamiliar situations  but on wanting to learn about and integrate them   he writes  galinsky also mentions that the efficacy of these policies must be supported by  incentives and resources to increase and manage diversity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the cbs research group recommends several strategies for expanding workplace diversity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the cbs website  the first course of action to creating a more diverse hollywood is to invite more diverse members into the academy of motion picture arts and sciences  there is already evidence that suggests that this is the direction tinseltown is heading  for instance  abc entertainment group president paul lee recently stepped down perhaps partially in response to the uproar and was replaced by former vice president of drama development channing dungey  the first african american woman to ever lead a major u s  broadcast network  star wars  the force awakens director j j  abrams remarked recently to e  news   i think the movies will get better  the stories will get stronger and audiences will respond bigger and that s good for the bottom line  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the article is quick to note that diversity within hollywood s industrial ranks will not necessarily guarantee that diverse perspectives will crop up more frequently in mainstream movies or that the nominees for the      oscars will necessarily be more diverse   real change requires more opportunities for under represented groups at every level of film making   notes the article on the cbs website </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  goizueta mba student shares emory s many healthcare focused opportunities</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this week  we featured an article highlighting some of the best mba programs for students interested in the intersection between business and healthcare  in reporting that piece  we came across a terrific recent blog post by a student working concurrently toward her mba at emory university s goizueta business school and her master of public health  mph  at emory s rollins school of public health </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that student  claire cooper  has generously given us permission to republish her piece here for the clear admit audience  read on to learn how cooper has sought out opportunities to gain hands on healthcare experience in the course of her time as a goizueta mba student and the advantages emory offers to other prospective healthcare focused business school students  the five semester  dual mba mph degree program in which collins is enrolled is one of three dual degree programs offered at emory for healthcare focused students  goizueta also offers its students an mba healthcare concentration that helps prepare them for a range of career paths in the healthcare industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   life at goizueta   the emory mba student blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>six ways to get hands on with healthcare by claire cooper</paragraph>
    <paragraph>considering its status as a top growing industry in america  it s no surprise that the business of healthcare is an area of growing emphasis at goizueta business school  in addition  atlanta is an ideal location to study healthcare  with world renowned medical research and treatment facilities and the center for disease control located steps from campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those considering concentrating in healthcare during their mba  i wanted to highlight how attending emory has helped me to delve into this field in exciting and hands on ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the dedicated healthcare management practice course  students are tasked with evaluating the prospects of commercial success of    medical device innovations competing for translational research funding  daily guest lecturers with years of experience evaluating such products mentor us and guide our thinking in determining which projects should be presented to funders  our work will directly inform the awarding of one million dollars of grant funding from the coutler foundation  associated with emory medical center </paragraph>
    <paragraph>goizueta students are allowed to take classes across campus at any of the other graduate schools or undergraduate classes for no additional fee  and for credit toward their mba  for example  i recently took a weekend long course at rollins one of the top ranked public health schools in the nation focusing on preparedness and planning for emergencies  taught by practitioners at the cdc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alternatively  if you plan ahead  you can complete both your mba and your master of public health degrees in only five semesters </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this semester alone i attended a phenomenal lecture and discussion led by naz modirzadeh  a law professor at harvard  on international law and ethics regarding the provision of healthcare and humanitarian aid in crises  there was as well a day long environmental health conference led by both local decision makers and international stakeholders </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kevin manion  a classmate from the class of       has begun a mentoring program that pairs biotech startup companies involved with an incubator program locally with mba students  we ve supported them in developing their market research and pitch and in targeting their messaging </paragraph>
    <paragraph>major players in the healthcare industry such as mckesson  genentech and emory healthcare actively recruit and interview on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond these opportunities  my healthcare focused classmates have taken courses such as  the business of healthcare  and  healthcare product and brand   many have participated in healthcare case competitions hosted by consulting companies  giving students the opportunity to delve into common problems faced by the industry and to show off their acumen to potential employers  several of us attended vanderbilt s healthcare conference </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as a major focus in goizueta s strategic growth plan  i look forward to seeing even greater opportunities in coming years for the development of those students interested in shaping the future of healthcare in this country and abroad  to me  it s critically important to combine my interest in business with my passion for healthcare  i hope to keep finding ways to build on this intersection </paragraph>

  <title>could nike s phil knight pay for your stanford gsb mba    </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>nike inc  co founder philip knight has given      million to stanford university to establish a scholarship program that will fully fund     high achieving students each year in their pursuit of graduate degrees at any of stanford s seven graduate schools  including stanford graduate school of business  gsb   the new knight hennessy scholars program  announced yesterday  is co named for stanford s outgoing president john l  hennessy  who will become the program s inaugural director when he steps down as president later this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> john and i dream of a future        or    years from now  when thousands of graduates who can think outside the box as skilled problem solvers will be working together for a more peaceful  habitable world   knight said in a statement  his gift is intended in part to honor the outgoing president s    year tenure leading stanford  he added  calling hennessy  one of the great academic leaders of our time  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>knight hennessy scholars to rival rhodes scholars stanford portrayed the new program as a rival to other distinguished scholarship programs such as the rhodes scholarship program  incorporating their best aspects but going beyond them  to offer a diverse  multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary education that is a hallmark of stanford  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we wanted to create something enduring  that would be unlike anything else currently available to the world s brightest minds  and that would make the biggest impact possible toward solving global challenges affecting the environment  health  education and human rights   hennessy said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program will seek to recruit students from a wide range of backgrounds and nationalities who demonstrate leadership and civic commitment  knight hennessy scholars will receive funding for three years to pursue master s or doctorate level degrees at any of stanford s seven top ranked graduate and professional schools  including the schools of law  business  medicine  engineering  humanities and sciences  education  and earth  energy and environmental sciences  stanford noted that scholars pursuing phd or md degrees will have the option to receive funding beyond three years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>complete admission and curriculum criteria are not yet available  but stanford has shared that prospective applicants must be nominated by their undergraduate universities and have completed at least three years of their undergraduate education  although they can apply up to four years after they have graduated  the first applications will be accepted in summer       and the first knight hennessy scholars will be admitted for fall      </paragraph>

  <title>the business of healthcare  mba programs that best prepare students to tackle a challenging industry</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>shaan patel s path to business school was a little different than most  with three years of medical school under his belt  the las vegas native traded the university of southern california  usc  for yale school of management  som   where he ll complete his mba before returning to usc for his final year of med school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> as a medical student  i wanted to learn more about healthcare management   he says  yale som has been great  he continues  offering plenty of healthcare electives as well as opportunities to collaborate with the yale school of medicine   one of the problems with medical school is that you become so focused on the pathophysiology of disease and clinical medicine that there s not much exposure to the business side of medicine  healthcare administration  insurance   he says  one yale som class in particular  healthcare  economics  finance and policy  helped him learn about things like medicare  medicaid and the roles played by pharmaceutical and insurance companies   most medical students have to learn those things on the job after they are in practice   patel notes  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while med students who take a leave of absence to pick up an mba along the way are not all that common  business students looking to specialize in healthcare make up a solid slice of the student body at several leading business schools for a host of reasons  for starters  healthcare is a recession proof industry offering a range of potential career paths  mba graduates can go on to work as administrators in hospitals  long term care facilities and rehabilitation facilities  as senior managers at insurance  biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms  or in increasingly prevalent healthcare focused roles in investment banking  consulting or venture capital  and with the digital health market expected to reach        billion by       it should come as no surprise that healthcare entrepreneurship is hot  too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>climbing healthcare costs have made identifying ways to generate profits while benefitting both providers and patients a constant challenge  aging populations in both the united states and europe ensure that strains upon the industry will only increase  and the introduction of the affordable care act  aca  in the u s  has shifted the paradigm of how doctors and hospitals are paid and how they deliver care  creating both new complexities and opportunities for innovation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as you can see  the question isn t why prospective applicants are seeking out mba programs that can teach them the business of healthcare  the question is which business schools do it best  </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan alum s app combats hiring biases</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an interview conducted for a recent press release published by mit sloan  alumna stephane lampkin  mba      discussed blendoor  an innovative new mobile app she designed to counteract hidden hiring biases related to gender and race </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lampkin  a stanford and mit sloan alum with five years  experience at microsoft under her belt  interviewed for an  analytical lead position at a major tech company   after eight separate visits  lampkin was told she was not an ideal fit for the company  the recruiter lamented   you re not quite technical enough  we ll reach out if a sales or marketing position opens up   lampkin told mit sloan news that the rejection provided the creative fuel to dream up blendoor   it s not necessarily overt racism  it s the way we re wired as human beings  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lampkin envisioned blendoor as a mobile access point to enable tech industry recruiters to find diverse  qualified applicants namely underrepresented people of color  women  and veterans and vice versa  according to a wall street journal study featured in the sloan press release  women make up less than a quarter of the workforce at the leading technology companies  the american economic association found that employers were twice as likely to respond to cvs with  white sounding names  in a      study entitled  are emily and greg more employable than lakisha and jamal    time and time again we see people being discriminated against because of the way their name sounds or the color of their skin   lampkin explains </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the  tinder like  gui anonymizes job seekers so companies are presented with  nameless  faceless profiles  that provide only the candidate s cv  lampkin explains   by hiding name and photo  we are basically showing recruiters how well a candidate meets the requirements of the role  and create opportunities for people who many have otherwise been overlooked because they didn t look the part  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in turn  blendoor job hunters are given access to a database of employment opportunities  once potential employers find a match  they can connect with candidates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so far  lampkin has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the tech industry  between direct investments and pitch competition prizes  blendoor has pulled in a respectable          in funding  lampkin is initiating a full throttle pr campaign that will hopefully increase that figure to    million by april  down the line  lampkin envisions blendoor s impact could extend to housing  finance and beyond </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  ross mbas get investment tips from warren buffett</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how would you like to trade investment tips over lunch with warren buffett  a group of mba students from the university of michigan s ross school of business had just that opportunity last month  two of them  cazzie palacios brown  mba ms      and michelle gross  mba ms       shared their experiences and some of what they learned from the value investing giant in a recent post on the ross student voices blog  they have generously allowed us to repost their piece here for the benefit of clear admit s readers  read on to learn how buffett classifies investments  his views on social impact investing  why he still uses a flip phone and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  ross student voices  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>warren buffett gave us a few investment tips over lunch</paragraph>
    <paragraph>warren buffett made his first investment at age     just five months after the bombing of pearl harbor  when we spoke to him last month  he said this was his biggest missed opportunity   not starting to invest earlier  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it was the first of many lessons we would hear from mr  buffett during several hours spent with him in omaha last month over lunch and a fireside chat with    other michigan ross students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite his wealth  fame and success  mr  buffett was incredibly humble and relatable  he shared insights and lessons from his professional experience and also offered us advice for a life well lived </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mr  buffett lives by the investment thesis   the world will do well over time   he pointed out to us that  despite two world wars  flu epidemics and other challenges  the dow jones industrial average has risen from    at the beginning of the last century to more than        today </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of what to buy  mr  buffett classifies potential investments into four categories </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he sticks to investing in the  important and knowable  category  and does not believe in getting sidetracked by microtrends like the internet bubble  it s worth noting here that he s so committed to this  he continues to use a flip phone and is still figuring out the voicemail function </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we toured three of the    subsidiaries that mr  buffett has invested in through berkshire hathaway  all of which he considers part of his  important and knowable  quadrant  oriental trading company  otc   borsheim s jewlery and nebraska furniture mart  there we met with executives such as borsheim s cfo erin limas and otc ceo sam taylor  who also happened to appear on an episode of undercover boss  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the issue of impact investing  or investing in businesses with a social cause  he  disagrees with many of his friends  because he believes  you can only maximize one variable at a time  profit or impact   mr  buffett told us he focuses on profit  though emphasized the incredible value of good business and integrity   but he has big plans to use most of his accumulated wealth for philanthropy  you ve heard of the warren buffett and bill gates giving pledge  right </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mr  buffett s views on impact had us thinking about and discussing what social impact means and how it can be created by organizations  corporations  communities and society as a whole  it sparked us to discuss and debate about where responsibility lies to create a positive impact in the world  and it raised questions about personal leadership styles and the types of impact we seek to create in the world </paragraph>

  <title>mba decisionwire entries reveal interesting applicant journeys</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with just a little over a month since mba decisionwire debuted  we re delighted that hundreds of applicants have already chosen to submit their admissions stories via this new resource  for the uninitiated  mba decisionwire is a crowdsourced companion tool to our hugely popular mba livewire  but distinct from mba livewire  which provides up to the minute insights from applicants at each stage of the admissions process  mba decisionwire is designed to capture an applicant s complete journey reflecting every school applied to  acceptances received and each applicant s ultimate revealing decision of where to actually enroll </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i was an absolute addict on livewire when i just had to know who was hearing what from which schools   shared one site visitor   but decisionwire  by virtue of reflecting how people are actually making the final call when faced with some tough choices  has been just as useful to me in a different way  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  the stories shared via mba decisionwire give valuable insight into the challenging decisions applicants face when presented with multiple acceptance offers and the factors that contribute to their decision of where to actually attend business school  of course  by gathering gmat and gpa data as well  mba decisionwire also lets those just beginning the application process benchmark themselves against those who have come before them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what really matters when choosing where to enroll  so  what matters most to applicants when it actually comes down to deciding where to enroll  the results are varied  not surprisingly  pedagogy  school reputation and perceived career opportunities are significant considerations for many  for instance  wharton s strength in marketing and entrepreneurship together with its alliance with insead proved more compelling than the university of chicago booth s international mba  imba  program for this applicant with a strong finance background looking to head into general management </paragraph>
    <paragraph> another applicant from this year applied to dual degree programs at each fuqua  ross and kellogg   chose northwestern s jd mba   the candidate shared   ultimately  business school ranking and career opportunities were the greatest influencer despite having received very generous scholarship opportunities from duke and michigan  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden s case method and small class size made it the better choice for this      applicant  who was deciding between charlottesville and charlotte after a rejection by nyu stern </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>show me the money money  of course  has made a difference in many decision making processes  here  chicago booth was the clear choice over dartmouth s tuck school of business when the former offered scholarship money and the latter did not </paragraph>
    <paragraph> but when both wharton and columbia business school offered fellowships to this      applicant  wharton s winter welcome weekend and its strength in leadership made the difference </paragraph>
    <paragraph> location  location  location sometimes  though  it really comes down to location   london is just an amazing city that i d love to spend     years living in not to mention the networking opportunities   wrote an applicant from this year who has enrolled at london business school  choosing it over cambridge s judge school of business and hec paris  which also offered him or her admission </paragraph>
    <paragraph>school x or bust certain applicants  of course  have a single minded focus on one school and one school only  we love to see them attain their goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  even entries that don t offer explanations within the notes section still present the dilemmas applicants have faced when confronted with acceptances at multiple top schools while also giving prospective applicants useful data points against which to benchmark their own candidacy </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph> super cool tool  i wish this had been around when i was making my decisions about where to go to business school   one early user told us  to be clear  we re excited to receive submissions from applicants just as they are making their decisions as part of this admissions season  but current students and alumni are also invited and encouraged to weigh in  an  entering year  field lets you select any of several recent application years  and those who have been out of school for a while can simply indicate  other  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>quick  easy and anonymous as the data continues to roll in  mba decisionwire will help prospective applicants just beginning to process extract valuable data points  as with mba livewire  mba decisionwire is completely anonymous and designed to be intuitive and easy to use  most users tell us that entering a submission takes a minute or less  and the search functions allow for easy filtering of previous entries </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph> while most candidates for this year have not yet made their final choices  deposit deadlines for round   are rolling along  so we are hoping that those who are finalizing their decisions will now add their  story    says clear admit s alex brown  who helped develop the new tool   we re thrilled at the early response to mba decisionwire thanks to everyone who has already submitted an entry   he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  mba decisionwire stands to grow even more interesting and valuable as more submissions roll in  so check it out  share your story and tell your friends and classmates to do the same </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a frequently asked questions page provides additional information about the tool  but if you have any additional questions or feedback  please contact dw clearadmit com  </paragraph>

  <title>columbia uncovers how honest faces often correlate with credibility</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>columbia business school  cbs  recently announced via press release its fascinating research into the relationship between faces perceived as trustworthy and whether or not those faces can actually be trusted  columbia business school professors and psychologists daniel ames and michael slepian explain that our knee jerk rulings of certain faces are more often than not accurate but for reasons one might not expect </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the press release  slepian explains   we found that people who looked trustworthy were in fact more likely to act trustworthy  finding evidence of the link between faces and honesty led us to dig deeper into why this link might emerge  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in ames and slepian s clinical survey  the duo requested that one collection of test subjects evaluate photos of individuals based on their perceived level of trustworthiness  this group of test subjects engaged in person with a different set of participants than the ones featured in the photos  in advance of the face to face engagements  the participants predicted the frequency at which the test subjects would trust them  these in the flesh participants also had financial motivation to avoid telling the truth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ames and slepian ventured that most of us have internalized expectations of how people expect us to behave and we act in accordance with these impressions  confirming the psychologists  suspicions  they found that the value judgments that test subjects made based on faces they encountered in the photos were a reliable prediction for how frequently the other group would lie in person </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the expectations that participants had for how test subjects would engage them correlated with their behavior based on others  perceptions of their level of  facial trustworthiness   it turns out that faces are accurate predictors of credibility because people tend to act in accordance with the judgments of others that they have learned to anticipate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ames elaborates in the columbia press release </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while the findings propose that faces may or may not convey certain signals  both ames and slepian insist that the major conclusion of the research relates less to signals that we subconsciously evaluate and more to the cumulative  internalized responses to others  expectations </paragraph>

  <title>nyu stern s center for sustainable business launches with    million from citi foundation</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>new york university s stern school of business today launched its new center for sustainable business  aided by a    million investment by the citi foundation  with leading environmentalist and former rainforest alliance president tensie whelan at the helm  the center will work to educate a new generation of business leaders capable of and committed to doing well by doing good </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern and the citi foundation have collaborated for more than a decade on programming to educate students on ways the private and public sectors together can help tackle some of the greatest challenges facing the planet today while driving sustainable economic growth  the new center s launch promises to expand these efforts through coursework  thought leadership and research  and stakeholder engagement and projects </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the citi foundation is helping us to get this whole center off the ground because it has a strong history of both inclusive business and innovation around sustainability   whelan says  in addition to its major investments in sustainability  the foundation also has a specialist on staff who works with teams around biodiversity and is even developing a new asset class around energy efficient loans  she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern  meanwhile  makes perfect sense as a home for the new center for sustainable business   business schools are the place where the future business leaders learn and we are at a phase in our global history where we need a new generation of leaders who adopt the idea that their businesses need to contribute value to society  not simply extract and deliver value to shareholders   whelan says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that stern sends large proportions of its graduates into finance and management consulting is also favorable in terms of the reach of the center s initiatives   we need more business leaders in finance who are looking to incorporate sustainability into their investment decisions   whelan says   on the consulting side  i believe that more and more consulting efforts will be focused on helping companies transition to become more sustainable   she adds   it is exciting to have students going into these sectors where they will have real impact  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new center s location in an urban area  too  is advantageous   we know that much of the future s growth will be coming in cities  and there will be a series of sustainability challenges associated with that growth  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a running start since stepping into her new role early last month  whelan has worked to establish an advisory board for the center that can help forge additional connections between academia and the corporate world  the board includes citi global head of productivity david chubak  raphael bemporad  founding partner of bbmg  nespresso usa president guillaume le cunff  and john d  williams  president and chief executive officer of domtar  creating an ongoing dialog with companies that understand sustainability can no longer be pushed to the periphery and that lead by example is one of her primary areas of focus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she s also focused on programming  specifically developing core sustainability classes for undergraduate and graduate business students   these will be very practical and hands on covering what you need to know to run a company in a way that is sustainable and bringing in guest speakers who are actually doing that   whelan says  the center will also provide executive education  working with companies interested in specially designed courses to help their executives learn sustainable practices  longer term  whelan hopes to also set up consulting projects with partner companies that will give students an opportunity to take what they are learning out of the classroom and into the boardroom   </paragraph>

  <title>entrepreneurship  kellogg  newest zell fellows settle in</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>though best known for producing a steady stream of crackerjack consultants and marketing mavens  northwestern s kellogg school of management is also making inroads when it comes to educating entrepreneurs  through the kellogg innovation   entrepreneurship initiative  kiei   the school is pioneering a lean methodology approach to launching new ventures that is steeped in experiential learning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to complement its  new venture creation  track  coursework that takes students through the full life cycle of new ventures from ideation to launch  kellogg also features a special program offering support to mba students who are trying to get ventures off the ground by graduation  called the zell fellows program  it is open to students who are either founding a startup or looking to grow an early stage venture  in december  nine students were selected as the newest cohort of zell fellows  with ventures ranging from a service that takes the stress out of packing lunch by delivering customized  allergy friendly meals directly to families  homes to a platform that creates interactive guides that hotels can give their guests at check in </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to david schonthal      program director and clinical assistant professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at kellogg  more than     students expressed interest in the program this year and roughly    submitted applications to be considered for participation  the cohort size remains small  though  because that s part of the program s unique  intrinsic value </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the fact that they go through this program together as a nine person cohort is super powerful   schonthal says   they develop strong relationships with each other  enhance and support one another they really become an advisory group for themselves almost like a young presidents  organization   he says  referring to the global peer network of ceos and business leaders  the support continues well after graduation  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the financial support zell fellows receive is another main benefit of the program   it provides a lot of resources that are often hard to get as you re just starting a business   schonthal says  with approximately         in funding per student  the program helps pay for business services ranging from graphic designers and coders to prototype shops and legal assistance   we believe their first job is to be a good student  so if we can provide services to help them advance their businesses while still focusing on being students first  that s great   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and then there s exposure to entrepreneurship beyond kellogg  in addition to treks to the san francisco bay area  students go on a trek every year to israel where they spend time with the program s benefactor  equity group investments chairman sam zell   we want them to get a sense that as zell fellows they are part of a global network of entrepreneurs   schonthal says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new this year is an executive coaching component  pairing zell fellows with seasoned entrepreneurs who serve as mentors and advisory board members and provide coaching tailored to individual entrepreneurs  needs   we offer lots of different resources to support each of them on their path   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now it its third year  the zell fellows program counts    fellows     of whom are running or have founded businesses  collectively  they have raised more than    million in funding  and    of the student founded ventures are still active </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>we know  tom petty  waiting is the hardest part  and some schools cough  stanford graduate school of business  gsb   cough certainly aren t making things easy on round   applicants  the stress is high  the updates are few and the results are pure poetry </paragraph>

    <paragraph>adele s popularity flat grammy performance notwithstanding is clear  but lionel richie  notorious b i g   jack johnson  aloe blacc  richard marx  ice cube  drake  taylor swift and warren g lyrics have also all provided points of departure for our creative in the face of anxiety crowd  eclectic musical tastes  we ll give you that </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>adding to the mix have been a haiku or two  a random non sequitur completely apropos of berkeley and a clever tuition payment plan </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  waiting for bolton of course  stanford gsb mba admissions director derrick bolton has received a couple of call outs by name  we ll check in with him to see if he has a favorite and report back </paragraph>

  <title>haas school of business grants seed money to mba student entrepreneurs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>uc berkeley s haas school of business awarded the first round of grants in a new program that intends to inspire mba student entrepreneurs to grow early stage startups </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the berkeley haas entrepreneurship program  bhep  awarded these first ten grants in december       and the next round will be bestowed in april      </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph> we re off to a great start with these ideas that attack pain points in industries ranging from agriculture to healthcare   bhep director rhonda shrader said in a statement   our student teams are so excited to begin testing their concepts  and this fund is generating a fresh level of enthusiasm among our student entrepreneurs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one concept that earned funding from the bhep is clima  which was initiated by mba student saharnaz safari  mba       during a road trip from san diego to the san francisco bay region  safari was struck by the drought ravaged landscape  she and her travel mate  an aerospace engineer  began to brainstorm about how drone technology might be used to help farmers in their plight to keep crops going amidst the drought  thus spawned clima </paragraph>
    <paragraph>safari and her colleague imagine a fleet of drones that could create rain and snow that would provide the moisture the land needs to rejuvenate  while these drones would be costly  at about         apiece  safari and her partner will use the grant to procure a smaller model that can be used to develop the concept and raise capital for the larger effort </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the fund has been very important in helping us build a minimum viable product   safari said in a statement   it also paves the path to receive additional funding  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other grant recipients will use their funding to develop an app that helps diabetics make healthy food choices  while another group is creating an app to provide assistance for citizens of impoverished communities in india </paragraph>

  <title>new startup marketplace matches haas mba students  scientists via speed dates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba students at uc berkeley s haas school of business have been taking part in speed dating of sorts with faculty and scientists at the university of california san francisco s school of pharmacy  have no fear this is not a story about anti fraternization policy violations or scandal  instead  it s a tale of creative matchmaking that gives haas students valuable experience with early stage science startups that need their business know how </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the idea was born out of a conversation last year between haas dean rich lyons and ucsf school of pharmacy dean joseph guglielmo  abby scott  associate director of emerging initiatives at haas  took the idea and ran with it developing it into the pilot startup marketplace  which launched in september      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the startup marketplace brings interested mba students together with ucsf faculty and scientists for a live online session in which each side delivers a brief elevator pitch to the other  after a series of online  speed dates   parties on both sides rank their top choices and matches are made </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the haas students devote between    and    hours during the semester consulting with the science startups  in the fall semester  seven mba students took part  many of them from haas s evening   weekend mba program  anita lal  ewmba      helped develop a roadmap charting potential business paths for alaunus biosciences  a startup that has developed a profiling technology to identify new drug targets and diagnostic biomarkers  alaunus was co founded by ucsf pharmaceutical chemistry professor charles craik </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s perhaps no surprise that craik saw something in lal as part of the speed dating process  in addition to work experience as a program manager at siemens healthcare and the business knowledge she s gained as a haas mba student  lal also happens to hold a phd in biochemistry and molecular biology  but the relationship has equally worthwhile for lal   for me  it s just exciting to see how a startup evolves and the hurdles that it faces   she said as part of the haas article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mentors provided by haas offer support to the mba students participating in the startup marketplace program  participating mentors have included startup advisor deepak gupta of the berkeley haas career management group  cmg  and rhonda shrader  who directs the berkeley haas entrepreneurship program  bhep  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with positive feedback from both parties in many of the matches made last fall  haas is expanding the pilot program with a new crop of participating students and startups this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we d like to see where we can take this next   said scott   in the future  we can bring together students with partners developing all kinds of different technologies  i can imagine us going to other departments  perhaps even working with incubators directly  or even moving it beyond just berkeley  </paragraph>

  <title>five tips for keeping love alive in business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as any business school student will tell you  the pressures of a top tier mba program can be overwhelming  and as anyone who s been in a romantic relationship can attest  care and attention are required to keep things on track  trying to tackle both simultaneously definitely presents some challenges  but couples from a range of leading schools assure us it can indeed be done </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in honor of valentine s day  they ve generously shared their tips for keeping love alive in business school  read on to learn what s worked for them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>be honest with yourself and each other about expectations nick arnold  who spent    years in the marine corps before heading to georgetown s mcdonough school of business  stresses the importance of understanding as a couple what you want to get out of business school before you get there  he and his wife  melissa  arrived at mcdonough with a six week old daughter  camille   i faced a couple of learning curves   the new dad jokes   we were very fortunate that we were clear with each other about our goals and expectations  which i think was key to navigating any of the challenges we ve faced   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it has been an exercise for my wife and me in terms of having clear priorities around what s important for us   he says   first and foremost is our daughter head and shoulders above all else   mcdonough  in washington  dc  was a top choice because it felt like a good place for a family  combining the advantages of urban life with lots of green space  melissa was also able to get a job working at medstar georgetown university hospital  an obstetrician gynecologist  she s fortunate to have highly transferable skills  nick notes   there will always be babies being born all over the world  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the decision to come to business school wasn t made overnight  he adds   it was something we thought about for a couple of years beforehand  so we had a good idea coming into it of what to expect  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>communicate and share calendars for mark schmid and brittany frye  who moved to charlottesville for mark to attend the university of virginia s darden school  keeping communication channels open has been key  the two are engaged to be married on july          at a charlottesville winery </paragraph>
    <paragraph> mark has always been really transparent  sharing what he is doing  what he s working on  keeping me in the loop   brittany says   it s also been a big advantage for us that brittany works here at the school   mark adds  as soon as mark got accepted  brittany began looking for a job in charlottesville  ultimately securing a marketing position with darden s executive education program   we carpool in together in the mornings  which gives us a chance to talk about whatever s going on   mark says  they also frequently have lunch together or meet up for first coffee  which takes place each morning at      in darden s pepsico forum   it s just downstairs for brittany   mark says   we are very lucky that we can do a lot of our communication in person   he adds  and if it s a particularly crazy day and they aren t able to see each other  they remain in touch via text </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we also make appointments on our outlook calendars for each other   brittany says  quick to confess that more often than not she is the one putting events on the calendar for him   as long as i put it on his calendar that we have dinner plans with friends  then that time is reserved  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg school of management couple jill and zac seidel also swear by shared calendars  zac is a second year mba student at kellogg and jill is in her first year of the dual degree mmm program  from which graduates receive both a kellogg mba and an m s  in design innovation from the segal design institute at the mccormick school of engineering and applied science   we share each other s calendars on our phones and send each other calendar invites for quite literally everything   jill says   if i have a group meeting one night  i send a calendar invite to zac to watch our son   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even valentine s day plans were set up by calendar invites  jill says   i am a lucky girl   she teases   i got a calendar invite two days ago for a dinner date on sunday  and zac arranged a babysitter for us   their    month old son david will become a big brother in april  when jill is due to give birth to their second child  which promises to ratchet up their reliance on shared calendars and babysitters even more </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  an mbalauncher shares her round   application process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>today s friday from the frontline features an interview with lisa atufunwa  a    year old denver native who submitted applications to five schools as part of round    business school has always been a part of her plan  and she s hoping the mba will help her pivot her career </paragraph>
    <paragraph>currently working in communications for a range of tech companies  startups and public holding companies  atufunwa is targeting schools with strong programs in marketing  her post mba goal is to become an assistant brand manager in the personal beauty sector  working for a company like l oreal  sephora or estee lauder   that s always been a personal passion of mine   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>taking part in the forte foundation s mbalaunch program helped atufunwa navigate the mba admissions process  read on to learn some of what she discovered in the process and the advice she has for future applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what business schools did you apply to  why did you choose them   lisa atufunwa  i applied to emory s goizueta school  vanderbilt s owen graduate school of business  the university of rochester s simon school of business  duke s fuqua school and the university of michigan s ross school of business  i chose them primarily because of the size of the programs  i was not looking for a program that had a large class small medium was my focus  i was also looking for a school that was not necessarily top ten  but that had a strong marketing program  location was a factor as well i would like to try to live in all parts of the united states  and most of the schools i applied to are in the south  which is a region i have yet to visit or live in  finally  speaking to alumni about their experiences also played into where i decided to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how did you hear about forte s mbalaunch program  what did you find most valuable about it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  i heard about it during my initial research into mba programs  i attended an mba fair here in denver  and a lot of the schools there brought it up to me  i had never heard about mbalaunch or forte before  so i did a little bit more research and contacted krystal brooks  who heads the launch program  to learn more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i became a launcher in       what i found most helpful was that it meant i wasn t alone going through the process  i was part of a group of like minded women trying to obtain the goal of becoming an mba candidate  i didn t feel like i was going through this by myself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the resources were also really valuable  we had access to a range of test prep and mba admissions consultants  first hand meetings with admissions officers at many schools and we got to meet with current students who had also gone through the forte program or are forte fellows  these were all very helpful </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what did you most enjoy about the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  writing my essays  i know a lot of people find that the most challenging part of the application process  but i enjoyed digging through my past and pinpointing the stories that i wanted to highlight </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of my favorite webinars as part of the mbalaunch program was delivered by angela guido  she led a session breaking down how to brainstorm and pick topics for your essay  it was very intriguing to see how to take a broad topic and narrow it down to who you are as a person  for example  she took the topic of family and asked everyone if family was a passion  she then broke down this very broad topic into discreet aspects  are you close with your family  why it is important to you  how do you prioritize family  she showed exactly how to take a general topic most applicants would write about and tailor it to who you are as an individual </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for one of my essays i chose to focus on the fact that i am bi cultural  i am nigerian american  in my essay i talked about the difficulties of growing up in two different cultures  for example  i don t speak my parents  native language  which means i am not able to communicate directly with my grandmother  i need to have a parent or relative with me whenever i talk to her  right now i am trying to achieve my goal of learning igbo so that i can talk to her myself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i shared in my essay how that s one of the things i am most proud of  but i also focused on the challenging aspect of learning a new language  highlighting how it has helped prepare me to go back to school for my mba  when you re learning a language  you are in a new territory trying to find your way  which i think offers parallels to what business school will be like </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how was your gmat experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  to be perfectly honest  i did not have a very good gmat experience  i had to take it multiple times  i felt it was the most challenging part of the application process  but the good thing about this time around was that thanks to the forte program i had a study partner  when i first took it was just me studying by myself  but i met a friend as part of my launch group and we ended up studying together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  did schools  female enrollment percentages factor into your decision of where to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  yes  i would say it was a factor into my decision of where to submit my applications  because of forte i did find myself asking a lot more questions about different aspects of how the schools focus on the growth of women applicants and what initiatives they have to help get more women into business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i plan to have continued involvement with forte  i am in constant conversation with krystal  and i am hoping to see if there are any volunteer opportunities i might participate in  i ve also made a point to participate in interviews like these  and i ve been sharing my experience informally with other current applicants as well telling them about forte and why they should sign up for the launch program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  is there anything you would change about the launch program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  actually  forte started an inaugural consulting core  inviting participants to propose ways the program could be made better  it was designed as an opportunity for launchers to get some hands on consulting experience while also giving back first hand  one of the recommendations we came up with was to make the gmat module longer  the mbalaunch program is broken into two different modules  but we felt the gmat section should be extended because the test is a major pain point for many applicants  based on our feedback  this is something forte has already changed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what made you choose to apply as part of round    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  i initially wanted to apply in round   but i didn t have the gmat score that i thought i needed  so i made the decision to push my applications to round   and take the test again  my advice for future applicants is that that s okay  even if you have a set plan for your application process  it s okay to deviate from that plan if it will help you prepare the strongest possible application </paragraph>

  <title>tops for tech  the best business schools for careers in technology</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>here s a fact you may not have known  several of today s leading technology innovators share one thing in common a montessori education  yep  google s larry page and sergei brin  amazon s jeff bezos  wikipedia founder jimmy wales  and simcity creator will wright were all educated as children using the self directed  hands on  collaborative teaching model developed by italian doctor and educator maria montessori  alas  though  not a single one has an mba so perhaps not a very useful factoid when you re trying to determine the best business schools for a career in technology </paragraph>
    <paragraph>facebook s mark zuckerberg  microsoft s bill gates  apple s steve jobs  michael dell  biz stone of twitter none of them has an mba either  and facebook second in command sheryl sandberg  who does have an mba from harvard business school  is famously on record recently saying the degree isn t necessary for success in tech  nevertheless  a growing tide of students are looking to use business school as their launch pad to successful careers in tech and the top tech firms  including those founded by non mbas  are snapping them up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why  you ask  part of it has to do with the blurring of lines between technology and more traditional business  one no longer exists without the other  as technology becomes central to accessing services and products  period  demand for the skill set of the mba with a technology specialization has become pervasive  facebook needs skilled general managers who understand strategy  operations  marketing and logistics but are more than conversant in tech   increasingly  for that matter  so do most any consumer packaged goods or manufacturing firms  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the same time  some of what draws a growing crop of mbas to technology firms is not completely divorced from montessori  in a      interview with barbara walters  google s co founders attributed their success in part to the latitude they had as young learners to follow their interests and decide for themselves what to learn   i think it was part of that training of not following rules and orders  and being self motivated  questioning what s going on in the world and doing things a little bit differently   page said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in this converging world  as tech companies must increasingly operate like traditional companies and vice versa  there are a handful of business schools that lead the pack in terms of preparing their graduates to land jobs at the top tech firms while also providing the flexibility and self direction that appealed so much to the earlier tech innovators  read on to learn about a few of the very best </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cmu s tepper school of business carnegie mellon university s tepper school of business sends a greater percentage of its graduates to work in the technology industry than any other leading business school a whopping       percent of the class of       consulting  the second most popular industry for tepper grads  draws just    percent  these stats may not come as a surprise to those acquainted with tepper  which has a long history of churning out quant wizzes with tech prowess  even so  it represents significant growth even for the traditionally tech focused school  as recently as       tepper sent just    percent of its grads into tech </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are several aspects of the tepper mba program that set students up for success in the technology field  for starters  any tepper mba student can choose to pursue a specialization in business technology  which combines technical and managerial coursework with experiential learning opportunities  the    faculty members who teach in the business technologies department boast an array of research and expertise between them  from big data and it management to e business and the economics of information systems  there were no fewer than    technology courses on offer this semester  </paragraph>

  <title>business school deposit deadlines  decisions  dilemmas  do tell </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the time has come for many round   applicants to make a decision about where they will attend business school in the fall  monday was the round   deposit deadline at harvard business school  hbs   and tomorrow deposits are due at chicago booth  duke s fuqua school  northwestern s kellogg school  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and yale school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for many  plunking down the cash to indicate to a school that you can t wait to join their mba class is as straightforward as it can be  no doubt there are quite a few triumphant applicants to hbs who sent in their        payments on monday or before with glee  if you were gunning for hbs all along  getting the news you d been accepted was possibly one of the happiest days of your life  and making your first payment felt like an unequivocal investment in your future </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for others  though  having to actually pull the trigger can cause some cognitive dissonance   you ll find some applicants saying   s     now i need to invest     k with significant opportunity cost  is it really worth it    notes clear admit s alex brown  who saw some of this when he worked in admissions at wharton  indeed  coming face to face with the reality of two years of lost income on top of already steep tuition fees is enough to give anyone pause  weighing this personal investment against the long term pay out both professionally and personally is an important process for all prospective business school students  some will have conducted complete return on investment  roi  calculations before even applying  but for others  this step comes later   before this time  all their energy was focused on getting into the best school they could  but now some of that energy is focused on how they will pay for it   brown says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>deposits to hedge your options  let s say  though  that you applied to hbs  chicago booth and wharton  but only chicago booth guaranteed you a seat in its class of       with hbs and wharton putting you on the waitlist  here s where things can get tricky  should you put down        at chicago booth to reserve your spot  even when you re holding out hope that hbs or wharton will accept you off the waitlist   nb  the deposit at booth is broken into two payments  one part due when you accept and a second later in the process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>faced with this scenario  many applicants will simply deposit at one school while waiting to hear from the school they want to attend more  forgoing the earlier deposit if they do indeed get in  brown says   schools know this   he adds  for some applicants  this is absolutely worth the potential loss of a few thousand dollars </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you could also ask for a deposit extension  although it s rarely granted  brown says   some will ask for family reasons say  you re waiting for a partner to get a decision on his or her career or school   he offers   that  of course  is dishonest if the real reason is that you are waiting for hbs   but deposit extension requests that are genuine and for a reason other than hedging your options are more likely to work  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in some cases  an applicant will request a deposit extension because he or she hopes to attend admit weekends at multiple schools to truly assess their fit within the culture   there is no risk to requesting a deposit extension   brown says   if the request is denied  then you simply pay your deposit    it s not like a school can rescind an offer because you asked for more time to make a decision  </paragraph>

  <title>beyonce  red lobster and harvard business school  unlikely bedfellows </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>what do mega star beyonce  seafood chain red lobster and harvard business school  hbs  have in common  for a brief stint earlier today  a little more than usual  an enterprising reporter at boston com stumbled upon a quirky little tidbit of not quite news namely  that typing  red lobster boston  into google maps returned a result suggesting that a branch of the chain restaurant glorified in bey s latest song could be found on the hbs campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s not true   i had no knowledge of this and don t understand how it could happen  because there s no red lobster on this campus   jim aisner  hbs director of media and public relations  told the boston com reporter with a laugh reportedly after typing the search term into the map tool himself and seeing the business school pop up </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>source  boston com</paragraph>
    <paragraph>in case you haven t been following along  beyonce released a new song and video entitled  formation  a day before performing it live at the super bowl halftime  in the song  she sings about taking a man to the sit down seafood chain for post coital cheddar bay biscuits   for what it s worth  she tackles a few weightier issues as well  including race in america  hurricane katrina and police brutality  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to a cnn com report  the restaurant chain saw a    percent increase in sales on sunday over the previous year as a result of the star s surprise endorsement  which occasioned        twitter mentions in a single hour and propelled the brand to trending status for the first time ever   a couple of hours after the halftime show  red lobster tweeted out this gem   cheddar bey biscuits  has a nice ring to it  don t you think   formation  beyonce   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs  for its part  wasn t going to be left out of a potential trending opportunity   as we confirmed this morning  there is no red lobster on campus   sorry  beyonce fans   read the school s twitter feed not long after the boston com story ran </paragraph>
    <paragraph>neither red lobster nor google returned boston com s request for comment on why hbs might have popped up in search results for boston area outposts  as of this writing  the anomaly has been corrected  red lobster s own website offers the following message in response to the same query   we re sorry  there are currently no red lobster restaurants located in your area  we look forward to serving you in the future as we continue to grow and expand across the country  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an hbs case in the making  what remains to be seen is whether more of a true connection could emerge between the former destiny s child star  the lakeland  florida born restaurant chain and the boston business school  will hbs employ its famed case method to examine the marketing phenomenon that unfolded around the super bowl  formation  performance  its biscuit endorsement and red lobster s resulting spike in sales  or perhaps around how red lobster could have made even more of the opportunity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s certainly plausible  in fact  beyonce has made her way into hbs classroom discussion before  an august      case by hbs professor anita elberse and stacie smith examined the december      release of the star s eponymous album  that case dug into the unorthodox release of the album by beyonce s company parkwood entertainment in partnership with sony music s label columbia records without any prior promotion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>elberse  for her part  specializes in studying the power of top tier entertainment stars   she even teaches a course as part of the school s executive education offerings called  business of entertainment  media and sports  bems   in which real celebrities sit side by side with entertainment executives to examine how to turn a star s brand enterprise and influence into profit  according to a forbes piece last week  basketball star dwayne wade  linebacker brandon marshall and supermodel karlie kloss  among other celebs who chose to remain anonymous  have taken part  elberse has used the beyonce case as teaching material in the bems course </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wouldn t it be a coup if elberse could convince bey herself to drop by when she next teaches the bems course  slated for june   to          hbs  that gives you a few months to find a spot for a red lobster on campus </paragraph>

    <paragraph>to help you bide the time as you wait  we thought we d share some of what livewire data told us about wharton s round   applicants  in round       percent of applicants who shared their results via livewire were accepted to the class of       another    percent were rejected  and the remaining   percent were placed on the waitlist  of those who got accepted in round    the average gmat score was     and the average gpa was     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we should note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who were accepted to wharton may have been more likely to share the news publicly  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan alumnus and partner attempt first round the world solar flight</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mit sloan alumnus andre borschberg and balloonist bertrand piccard are currently attempting the first round the world flight using only the power of the sun  both men co founded the solar flight project  named solar impulse  which is based in switzerland </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the aim of the voyage is to travel around the globe at high altitude using no fuel and releasing zero pollutants  the airplane  solar impulse    is constructed from carbon fiber and weighs no more than an average car  with the wingspan of a jumbo jet and the engine power of a small motorcycle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pair completed the first of part of their journey in july of      traversing the pacific from japan to hawaii  traveling       miles over     hours before experiencing battery malfunction and landing in hawaii  they plan to resume flight in april      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while the first flight around the world without the use of fuel is an incredible feat in itself  borcshberg and piccard have greater ambitions outside the act itself  they hope to demonstrate the power of solar energy and inspire others to make use of renewable energy  the poetic ambitions of flying for change are fitting for the two men  who have chosen to pursue innovation beyond the domains of aviation and engineering alone  as if that weren t enough   seeking further to change the world at large </paragraph>
    <paragraph>their website reads  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the environmentally conscious and adventuresome spirit that imbues the men s mission is one of family tradition for bertrand piccard  whose father and grandfather are both famous explorers  bertrand s father  jacques piccard oceanographer and engineer took part in the first exploration of the mariana trench  whereas august piccard  bertand s grandfather  twice claimed the record for highest altitude reached in an air balloon  bertand himself also earned fame for being the first person to fly around the world in a continuous air balloon flight </paragraph>
    <paragraph>given piccard s prior accomplishments and borschberg s    plus years of pilot and aircraft construction experience  one is hard up to imagine a duo more capable of shaping the future </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg marketing students award super bowl win to toyota s prius</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>you may have heard that the denver broncos won the super bowl on sunday and even that the team s star peyton manning became the winningest quarterback in national football league  nfl  history  but according to marketing students at northwestern s kellogg school of management  bragging rights go to toyota for its ad promoting the prius  which ran during the game </paragraph>
    <paragraph>super bowl advertising is big business  according to ad week  advertisers paid as much as    million per    second spot as part of sunday s game  which aired on cbs and drew       million viewers  the prius commercial  entitled  the longest chase   clocked in at one minute and    seconds which based on the ad week figure would add up to more than     million in ad spend </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>for toyota  at least  it was money well spent  according to the    kellogg mba students who scrutinized each ad during the big game as part of the school s   th annual kellogg school super bowl advertising review  led by kellogg professors derek d  rucker and tim calkins  the highly anticipated event draws dozens of students each year eager to put what they re learning as part of their marketing coursework into practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the students employ a strategic framework  which goes by the acronym adplan  to evaluate the effectiveness of each super bowl commercial according to six criteria  attention  distinction  positioning  linkage  amplification and net equity </paragraph>
    <paragraph> toyota s prius was a clear winner in this year s super bowl because it kept our attention  had strong linkage to the brand and showcased its benefits   rucker said in a statement  starring former characters from the television show the wire posing as bank robbers escaping police  the ad pokes fun at the stereotype of the prius as a slow car </paragraph>
    <paragraph>doritos  with an ad depicting a birth induced by a chip eating dad  also received high marks from the kellogg team  as did budweiser  t mobile  audi and turbotax </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maybe not the best spent marketing dollars comedians keegan michael key and jordan peele teamed up to promote website builder and blogging platform squarespace  but the kellogg students deemed that ad a flop  giving it a grade of  f   it marks the second year in a row that squarespace has ranked at the bottom of the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is not a surprise as our panel found it both confusing and lacking a clear point of difference   rucker said  also coming in toward the bottom of the ranking although slightly above squarespace with a  d  grade were acura  apartments com  buick  jublia  lg  persil  sofi and suntrust </paragraph>
    <paragraph> while many advertisers played it safe  our panel found most of the overall advertising worked well with strong branding and many companies communicated a clear point of difference   calkins said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba student courtney firestone was thrilled to take part   as a student  getting to participate in kellogg s super bowl ad review was a great experience to apply what we ve learned in class   she said in a statement </paragraph>

  <title>approaching the mba team based discussion or group interview  advice for wharton        ross interviewees</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>did you receive an invitation to interview as part of round   at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  are you gearing up for an interview at the university of michigan s ross school  in either or both cases  congratulations  now  it s time to prepare for the mba team based discussion  tbd  or group interview  as the schools refer to their unique group evaluations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is the team based discussion  a few years ago  the admissions office at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school partnered with the wharton innovation group to launch a new evaluation method  the team based discussion  tbd   as its name suggests  as part of the tbd  applicants are placed into a group with five to six other applicants for an interactive discussion about real life business scenarios  designed to reveal to the admissions committee how each applicant approaches and analyzes specific situations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our hope is that this will give applicants a glimpse into wharton s group learning dynamic  which is central to our program   karl t  ulrich  vice dean of innovation at wharton  said about the tbd when it launched as part of the         application season   we believe that this type of assessment also serves as a tool to take prospective students  off the page  and allows us to see firsthand the ways in which they can contribute to our community of diverse learners and leaders   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>deputy vice dean of admissions  financial aid and career management maryellen lamb echoed ulrich s sentiments in a post on the school s mba admissions blog   our goal was to give our potential students an opportunity to show us who they are how they think  lead  communicate and interact   she said   at the same time  we wanted our applicants to experience who we are a highly collaborative culture that cultivates persuasive rather than positional leadership  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the way teams of applicants are assembled is simply a function of who signs up when  the school reports   there is no  crafting  done on our end   lamb says  each participant will receive a prompt for the tbd in advance  and wharton recommends spending about an hour in advance preparing for the discussion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the majority of tbd interviews will be held on wharton s philadelphia campus and conducted by admissions fellows  a select group of second year mba students  but tbds will also be held in various cities around the world as part of each round  these sessions will be conducted by admissions officers   on  and off campus team based discussions will be conducted in the same way and considered equally   wharton s website states   there is no  advantage  in choosing either option  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here s the prompt received by applicants who were invited to interview as part of round    identical to the round   prompt  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the diversity of interests and backgrounds of the wharton mba community is reflected in the variety of programs that we support  the african american mba association  private equity and venture capital club  wharton women in business  entrepreneurship club  and the veteran s club are five of the more than one hundred student run clubs here at wharton  each year  many of these clubs run conferences  providing unique and exclusive opportunities for students to engage with business and thought leaders around the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the purpose of this discussion  picture yourself as a core member of a student run club s conference committee  feel free to consider yourself part of an existing club or one that has not yet been created  in this role  you and your team must create and deliver a one day  high impact conference on the topic of your choice keeping in mind that the event s aim is to provide a forum for students  faculty  alumni  thought leaders  and executives to explore and challenge ideas related to the topic at hand  please take a moment to learn more about the current wharton mba student led clubs and conferences </paragraph>
    <paragraph>please come prepared to share your thoughts with the group in one minute or less before moving into the team discussion  you should plan to spend no more than one hour in preparation for this part of the process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  what s the best way to approach the tbd  you ask  we consulted our resident expert  alex brown  who worked in admissions at wharton for several years  here s his take </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  kellogg mbas gear up for super bowl ad review</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s time for the super bowl and at northwestern s kellogg school of management  that means it s also time for the super bowl ad review  brands spend more than    billion each year to advertise their products through super bowl commercials  some more effectively than others  for the   th year running  kellogg marketing students will apply their unique framework for evaluating an ad s brand building potential as part of the      kellogg super bowl ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the players take the field on sunday  more than    kellogg mba students will team up with marketing professors tim calkins and derek rucker to determine the winners and the losers in the battle of the brands  they ll us the adplan framework to evaluate each ad according to six critical criteria  attention  distinction  positioning  linkage  amplifications and net equity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a recent post on the kellogg mba student blog  four students share why they are excited to participate  and for anyone who wants to follow along on game day  the kellogg ad review team will be tweeting live using the hashtag  kelloggsb </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   the inside perspective   kellogg s mba student blog  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in anticipation of sunday s event  we asked four students why they wanted to participate in the ad review and what they re hoping to take away from this unique experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jillian fishman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>why did you want to participate in the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now that i am recruiting for roles in marketing and branding at kellogg  the super bowl ad review was a unique opportunity to apply a strategic framework to the real world and evaluate advertising objectively  not just whether it tugged at my heartstrings  in addition  several companies debuted ads this year colgate  lg and paypal so it will be fascinating to see whether they can effectively build their brands during the most watched tv broadcast in the u s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you hoping to learn from the experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the cost of advertising continues to skyrocket  the super bowl has become more high stakes than ever  brands need to be able to justify the multi million dollar investment for mere seconds of airtime  for this reason  i was eager to learn kellogg s strategic adplan framework and apply it in real time during the super bowl  it is an honor to be a part of this longstanding kellogg tradition that determines the super bowl s winners and losers  aside from the actual game  of course  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>andrea sanchez ferro</paragraph>
    <paragraph>why did you want to participate in the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>coming from a different region latin america the super bowl ad review is a must experience for me  i consider this event an opportunity to bring a different point of view to the table  grounded in my previous knowledge from working with cpg brands back home  while using the adplan strategic tool that i have learned here at kellogg  i am really looking forward to seeing the impactful ads and messages that many companies want all of the u s  to see during one of the highlight events of the year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you hoping to learn from the experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sharing time with my kellogg peers while learning from top kellogg professors who have a lot of experience with evaluating advertising is really valuable for me </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leslie kwang</paragraph>
    <paragraph>why did you want to participate in the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are many amazing opportunities available at kellogg  but the super bowl ad review is one of the ones that really stand out as a quintessential kellogg tradition  i wanted to participate not only because of the uniqueness of the opportunity  but also because i was interested in being part of something big within the kellogg community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you hoping to learn from the experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the super bowl is the single biggest advertising event of the year when companies spend millions of dollars on a tv spot  under the pressure of high stakes and large viewership  companies go all out on their super bowl ads   and some fly while others flop  i am excited to be part of evaluating these ads and learn what makes a promotion effective  the brand managers and creative agencies that create the super bowl ads are all smart  but why don t some of their ideas don t go as planned  what makes a super bowl ad truly great while another misses the mark  these are the types of questions that i hope to resolve from my experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hannah park</paragraph>
    <paragraph>why did you want to participate in the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prior to kellogg  i was an account supervisor at grey advertising for the nfl  two of my campaigns aired during the game last year  so i am familiar with how much thought and work goes on behind the scenes  i m excited to be on the other side this year and to analyze the ads from a marketing perspective  part of what makes the kellogg experience so unique is the ability to participate in collaborative and experiential learning opportunities like the super bowl ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you hoping to learn from this unique experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>having been so close to the creative in my prior job  this will be a great way to step back and think like a marketer  it s important to not only entertain and break out from the crowd  but to also drive business  i ll be interested to see which brands can seamlessly merge good storytelling with brand positioning  it s the   th super bowl this year  so i m excited to see how marketers will up their game </paragraph>

  <title>livewire analysis reveals strength of rejected hbs round   applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  sent out the second and final wave of interview invites for round   candidates yesterday   a quick analysis of the status updates received on mba livewire in the past    hours suggests that the rejected hbs applicants are incredibly impressive  of the     candidates who shared a status of rejection  the average gmat was     and the average gpa was      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  lessons from the mba livewire data in round   tell us that those making the cut for interviews and ultimately admission do not look terribly different where the raw statistics are concerned  here s a quick recap  roughly one third of round   applicants who reported results on mba livewire received an invitation to interview  among those  reported gpas ranged from     to      with an average of      the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      the ranges and averages were much the same for those who got a rejection  the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all of this to say that hbs has many more qualified candidates than it can possibly accept   at the end of the day  while you clearly need great scores and grades to stay in the running at hbs  the difference comes down to several other factors  like leadership experience  employer caliber  caliber and nature of undergraduate experience  career sector  current location  future plans  outside activities  emotional intelligence  letters of recommendation and ethnic social socioeconomic diversity   notes clear admit co founder eliot ingram </paragraph>

  <title>innovative fund gives columbia business school mba students hands on value investing experience</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>where should you go to business school if you want to pursue value investing  a new student led fund at columbia business school  cbs  established with a       million donation by investment guru thomas russo makes the new york city mba program a good bet </paragraph>
    <paragraph>value investing the philosophy favored by warren buffett  among others  of buying undervalued assets and then exercising patience as their long term fundamentals reveal greater value can be hard for mba students to grasp in a tangible way in the two short years they spend in business school  indeed  most academic research suggests that value investing works best over the long run </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo  a student of buffett s  wants to help groom the next generation of value investors  and so he s created the  x x  student value investment fund to give mba students the real world experience he believes is required </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  five by five by five  arose from my long held belief that students ought to have an opportunity to derive deep and lasting lessons from student investment funds   russo  who is a managing member at gardner russo   gardner llc and an advisory board member for cbs s heilbrunn center for graham   dodd investing  said as part of an article on the cbs website   the biggest lessons occur over time   the fund is  trying to get investors  horizons stretched out beyond five minutes  five days or even five quarters  i want the  x x  portfolio to succeed and underscore the message that long term investing is actually a worthy and profitable pursuit  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo says he chose cbs for the project and not his own alma mater stanford gsb because of the the school s strong legacy of value investing  indeed  the investment paradigm was developed by cbs professors ben graham and david dodd in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the fund s name reflects its unique structure  five students each select funds based on their ability to deliver compound returns over a five year holding period providing five  or fewer  clear  understandable and succinct reasons for their choices </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in investing  you learn by doing   mallory downing  mba      said as part of the news article  downing s recommendation of cummins inc   cmi   a power and automotive equipment manufacturer  was one of the five selected for the first year s portfolio   a lot of our coursework is pitching stocks  but we ve never actually put money behind them  we haven t had to live with them  this is different  sticking with your investment for five years takes a lot of work  it s dealing with the ups and downs  it s so much of a learning experience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>downing s recommendation  along with    others  were selected by professors bruce greenwald and tano santos as part of their spring course   value investing with legends   the fund s investment board voted on five of the    to receive         investments and be included in the portfolio  in addition to downing  the board also chose patrick enriquez fisher  mba      for his selected position in john deere  de   oystein kvaerner  mba      for his selected position in the weir group  weir   richard taddonio  mba      for his selected position in qualcomm  qcom   and brian waterhouse  mba     for his selected position in cdk global  cdk  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in each of the four upcoming years  five new investments will be added  so that the fund will ultimately be comprised of    total investments  when each selected investment reaches the end of its five year holding period  it will be liquidated to provide funding for future  x x  fund participants to invest  investment amounts in year six and beyond will be increased to adjust for inflation  with any additional profits will help fund scholarships for columbia business school students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of participation in the fund  russo has asked that each student commit to returning to cbs each year of their investment s five year holding period to personally interact with newly selected student managers  current year students will benefit from learning how the selections of prior students performed and also receive constructive feedback on their own selections </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we hope students will learn to be long term investors with the full benefit of hindsight as to what has worked and what has not worked from investments selected by their predecessors   meredith trivedi  administrative director of the heilbrunn center  said in the cbs article  networking opportunities between current and prior fund participants will also prove useful to those interested in global value investment management careers  the school hopes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo  greenwald and trivedi  together with    students  will make up the  x x  fund s board  eventually  the students will be those with the most recent stock picks in the portfolio  but since only five students have so far invested  the other five currently on the board were elected by their peers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the opportunity to sit down with people like tom russo and bruce greenwald and have such personal attention is very  very rare  learning from investors like them  on a very intimate basis  has been an unparalleled opportunity   downing said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo hopes the unique nature of the fund will give business school students an opportunity to learn what it s like to invest for the long term   investment funds run by students typically fail       because they typically just focus on investments popular for the short term   he said  driven to find the fastest way to maximize near term results  positions are sold at the end of each term  which means that subsequent students then engage in their own short term portfolio trading   that way of investing reinforces all the worst conduct on wall street   russo said   most importantly  subsequent student participants never gain the benefit of learning from their predecessors  investment mistakes  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo  whose own son  christopher russo  is a      cbs graduate  reiterated his admiration for the school s value investing legacy   i wanted to respect columbia business school with this gift for the great  education  that has been offered to so many people i have revered within the value investment community over so many years   he said </paragraph>

  <title>tuck students attend december s paris cop    bring climate talks back to campus</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>four mba students from dartmouth s tuck school of business sat front and center for the climate talks in paris  cop     that grabbed the world s attention in december  now those students are back on campus sharing what they learned with their classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  students from tuck have attended five of the past seven climate summits in copenhagen  cancun  doha and warsaw in addition to paris s cop   with professor anant sundaram   honestly  it continues to surprise me that more schools don t do this   he says  but to his knowledge  tuck is alone in having mba students attend  he suspects part of it is inertia the united nations doesn t make it easy to take part  requiring that those who want to attend formally apply for non governmental organization  ngo  observer status  additionally  only a handful of slots are awarded to each ngo  and he suspects that they have gone to students outside of the business schools at places like harvard  columbia or yale </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>sundaram s own interests propelled him to begin teaching a course back in      on business and climate change  which tuck says was the first of its kind to be offered at a u s  business school  today  many leading business schools offer options for students interested in sustainability  from unc s kenan flagler school of business  which features a sustainability concentration  to yale school of management  which offers a joint degree in business and the environment with the yale school of forestry   environmental studies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>corporations  not countries  produce emissions as sundaram sees it and argues in his classes businesses and individuals are the ones that produce emissions that lead to climate change  not countries  corporations must drive change  he continues  by developing efficiency technologies  shifting to renewable energy sources and implementing carbon capture and sequestration systems  the idea to send students to the climate talks was a natural outgrowth of his classes  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>still  the tuck students  presence there surprises many   people always kind of do a double take and say   what is a business school doing here    sundaram says   and i say   who is causing the emissions  corporations  and who are the people that run those companies  mbas   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as he sees it  the careers of today s mba students are going to evolve in a world where two things are true  first  climate change will happen in a far more significant way  and second  there will be a global price on carbon  which will have stunning implications   for these reasons  it makes complete sense to have business school students attend climate talks   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>winning student essays snag spots at summit the program that allows tuck students to do just that is run through the school s center for business   society  interested students there were about    this fall apply to go  each writing an essay about why they should get to take part  the four selected to attend the cop   in paris in december were tuck alumna christine hou  mba      and second year mba students patrick turevon  nell achtmeyer and kelsey maceachern  as official observers at the talks  the students got to waltz in and out of breakout sessions  roundtable discussions and press conferences taking place behind the scenes at the headline making climate negotiations last month </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in one instance  maceachern and achtmeyer found themselves with front row seats to a press conference where former new york city mayor michael bloomberg and bank of england governor mike carney unveiled a new task force charged with developing ways to measure the financial exposure companies have to climate change   for me  it reinforced how important these issues truly are for all types of business leaders  no matter the industry   achtmeyer says   it was certainly one of the most impactful events i attended   </paragraph>

    <paragraph>hbs managing director of admissions and financial aid dee leopold is on record saying that the timing of an interview invitation whether as part of last week s first wave or today s second wave is not a reflection of your candidacy  that said  she didn t address applicant speculation about the significance of interview invite timing head on this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last year  she was a little more direct  here s what she shared then </paragraph>
    <paragraph> how many in each wave  we really don t know yet and that s because we re not actually finished with reading the written applications  so best guess might be     in the first wave and     in the second  i ve said this before  but please don t speculate or develop theories or algorithms about first vs  second  it doesn t work that way  and it has nothing to do with when you submitted  where you live  or the first letter of your last name  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and the year before  she shared this </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i m aware of all the speculation about how many invitations go out in each wave and if certain geographies or backgrounds are more likely to go out in the first vs  second wave  how we split up these waves varies from year to year and to avoid a lot of algorithms being built out there by those with far more sophisticated quant skills than we possess in dillon  i d rather just leave it at  many  and  some   i can assure you that geography and background have nothing to do with the waves it s all about human beings here in dillon reading a lot of applications thoroughly  we devote a great amount of effort to finding the right balance between minimizing your wait time and maximizing the care and attention we give to each application  we are not running your applications through any kind of machine we re reading them  and reading again  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one way or another  you should all know with certainty in a matter of minutes whether you ve made the cut  we re wishing everyone good luck </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a reminder to all  hub cities for round   interviews this year are london  paris  mumbai  dubai  tokyo  menlo park and new york city   remember  where you choose to interview has no bearing on the evaluation process all of our interviews are conducted by members of the admissions board   leopold shared in a recent blog post  she added that even those who interview in a hub city should feel  warmly invited  to take part in campus interview days in boston </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those of you who do get a coveted interview invitation today  don t forget to download the clear admit hbs interview guide or scroll through past applicants  accounts in the interview archive as you prepare </paragraph>

  <title>consulting career prep at nyu s stern school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you want to earn an mba with the end goal of pursuing a consulting career  new york university s stern school of business should be on your radar  stern had    percent of its      graduates accept jobs in the consulting field  furthermore  eight prominent consulting firms hired three or more graduates from the stern school each in       consulting employers include the boston consulting group  mckinsey   company and pricewaterhousecoopers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to prepare its students for these consulting careers  the stern school offers a variety of classroom instruction  extracurricular activities  and career preparation options for its students  to learn more  we contacted roxanne hori  stern s associate dean of corporate relations  career services and leadership development </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how does stern help prepare students for careers in consulting </paragraph>
    <paragraph> nyu stern mba students have access to extensive programming  mentors and networking through the school s office of career development as well as the management consulting association  one of our popular student clubs   said hori </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the management consulting association  which aims to help students prepare for a career in the management consulting industry  offers stern school students corporate presentations  networking events and casing boot camps  the boot camps are designed to help students prepare for and practice casing interviews for consulting roles </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern also has an office of career development to help students manage their career growth  as well as a global alumni network of more than          resume reviews  on campus recruiting and industry panels are regular features of stern school career development  furthermore  students gain access to top consulting firms at a variety of formal and informal events that are held both on campus or hosted by the companies themselves  this gives students the chance to get to know the firms  office culture and find the company that is the best fit for their career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and all of this preparation is paying off  hori noted that  over the past decade  the percentage of graduating full time mba stern school students who accepted consulting jobs has doubled  furthermore  for the most recent graduating class  class of        more students went into consulting than investment banking  the consulting field is increasingly attractive to mba students  and stern school graduates are successfully obtaining consulting jobs in record numbers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what skills do consulting firms value most  and how can stern mba students gain those skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the nature of consulting work is a great match with our student profile   said hori   we seek applicants who possess both strong intellectual and interpersonal strengths what we call iq   eq   she also noted that consultants must be very smart  good with clients and effective managers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she added that many stern school students hone their skills through the stern consulting corps  board fellows program  leadership development program and club leadership roles  the stern consulting corps encourages students to apply classroom knowledge of consulting to clients such as carnegie hall  city harvest and the william j  clinton foundation  meanwhile  the leadership development program offers students personalized leadership and experiential learning opportunities to help them grow as business leaders </paragraph>
    <paragraph>again  this extensive preparation pays off career wise </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the consulting firms acknowledge the value of this winning combination by hiring our students   said hori </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what makes consulting jobs so appealing in today s job market </paragraph>
    <paragraph> consulting roles are intellectually demanding  consist of rotating short term engagements and require a quick ramp up period   said hori   as a result  management consultants are pushed to learn at a faster pace compared to other industries and functions  embrace diverse subject matter  be nimble and adapt readily to change  </paragraph>

  <title> fridays from the frontline  yale som mba student tests his mettle on shark tank</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week in fridays from the frontline we re featuring an exclusive interview with shaan patel  a    year old  second year mba student at yale school of management  som  who tonight will appear on abc s shark tank  patel  who is taking a two year leave of absence from medical school to get his mba  also runs a company on the side that helps high school students prepare for the sat and act college entrance exams  the las vegas native launched the company called      expert sat prep to teach others the strategies that helped him achieve his own perfect      sat score </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  he shares how business school prepared him for shark tank and why he thinks the mba is a valuable path for entrepreneurs  he also offers tips for business school students who want to try their hand at getting on the show   even thought he had to wait in line for nine hours for the casting call missing a pitch competition taking place back on campus as a result he thinks it was worth it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though his shark tank episode taped in june  he s contractually prohibited from sharing how things went when he pitched to the panel of formidable business tycoons  will he get the venture capital he needs to transform a small business into something big  or will he have to keep bootstrapping  if you re curious  tune in tonight at   p m  est to find out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  tell us about your business  what does it do and how did it get started </paragraph>
    <paragraph>shaan patel  i founded a test prep company that runs six week sat and act prep courses in    cities across the country and online  the way it started was actually a really circuitous path  i never planned to start a test prep company  back when i was in high school i studied quite a bit for the sat myself after initially getting an average score  i ended up getting a perfect score a feat achieved by only     percent of students  it really changed my life i got into great schools  was offered scholarship money and even got to meet the president </paragraph>
    <paragraph>initially i set out to write a book  i pitched     publishers with a book proposal but was turned down  i had all this material and was wondering what to do with it  and so i decided to teach a course  the courses ended up being very successful resulting in an average score improvement of     points  that s pretty unheard of and can really change someone s life </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think it was so successful in part because i know some of the roadblocks  challenges and thought processes students have when approaching the test inappropriately  i was in their shoes  i have also learned some tricks along the way  here s an example of a strategy that i teach that i have never seen taught anywhere else  if you see the word  being  in an sat answer choice  it s probably an incorrect response  i instruct my students to just get rid of answers that have the word  being  in them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i have also developed a template for students to follow so they can prepare in advance for the writing portion of the test  without knowing the topic  they can practice this template and be prepared to tackle the written portion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we really just make things really simple for them to understand  that s why our courses work for students starting at any level  honestly  i have spent more time developing the material thousands of hours than i did even studying myself  and i was the perfect score sat student who studied in the library all the time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  describe your path to business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sp  my path to business school is probably different than most  i have already completed three years of medical school at usc  i then took a two year leave of absence to complete business school at yale school of management  som   i am almost done with business school  and then i ll return and finish my last year of med school at usc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there was a dual purpose to my decision to take a leave of access from med school  first  my business was growing organically in vegas  and i was in med school and so didn t have a lot of time to focus on it or think about expanding  also  i was a bio premed major in college  not a business major  i thought business school would help me learn how to scale my business  second  as a medical student  i wanted to learn more about healthcare management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale som has been great for me  there is a great entrepreneurship community that is really growing there  the new building evans hall is also magnificent  it s really a great place to be  and there are also a lot of cool healthcare opportunities and chances to collaborate with the yale school of medicine </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how did business school prepare you for shark tank </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sp  i am very involved in entrepreneurship classes and in the startup community at yale  one of the great things about business school is that students interested in entrepreneurship pitch a lot  i have had tons of practice pitching ideas and learning how to make them as succinct as possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one really tangible way business school helped me prepare for shark tank was perfecting my    second pitch  you have only    seconds to impress the casting call director in order to get a call back  i spent hours with my fellow business school students practicing my pitch  and it paid off  something like        people a year audition for shark tank and only     end up getting on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how did yale som in particular prepare you for shark tank </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sp  one of the most significant classes that i have taken at som was a management software development course taught by kyle jensen  it taught me the importance of lean methodolgy as it applies to agile development of software  as a result of that class  i decided it was important to have a web developer on our staff  which helped create a better user experience both for visitors to our website and for people who enroll and take our classes  this will also be particularly important when shark tank airs  we expect at least         hits after seven million people watch me on the show </paragraph>

  <title>    million alumni gift to expand  rename wharton leadership program</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>believing firmly that leadership can be both taught and learned  wharton alumna anne welsh mcnulty  mba      has pledged     million to the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania to expand its efforts to train leaders who impact the world  in recognition of this generous gift  the wharton leadership program  launched    years ago  will be renamed the anne and john mcnulty leadership program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcnulty met her late husband john  mba      well before they were classmates at wharton  they both grew up in philadelphia and were sweethearts at cardinal o hara high school  but it was wharton that would train them to become leaders  before his sudden death of a heart attack in       john rose through the ranks at goldman sachs to become partner  then co head of the asset management division and ultimately to lead the creation of its investment management division  anne  previously a managing director at goldman and a senior executive of its hedge fund strategies group  today is the co founder and managing partner of jbk partners  an investment management firm and private philanthropic foundation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we didn t have leadership classes per se when we were at wharton  but you learned by example   she recalls   the biggest change was suddenly being exposed to people from not only around the country but around the world   she says   it changed the context in which you thought about problems  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an inherent belief that leadership can be learned and taught  the most important thing about wharton is that there is an inherent belief there that leadership can be learned and can be taught   she continues   though some of us may think there are natural leaders in preschool  generally people can learn and get better at it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the newly christened anne and john mcnulty leadership program is founded on that very idea and employs a unique combination of coursework  coaching and experiential learning to help its students develop leadership skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the wharton approach first of all is about presenting the core concepts and the foundational research that exists in the realm of leadership and teamwork   says jeff klein  who has served as executive director of the wharton leadership program for the past    years   we begin by getting students familiar with it  and then we work on getting them into situations where they can test their ability and effectiveness as leaders  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton also encourages students to surround themselves with coaches  mentors and trusted colleagues  klein says   leadership is a social experience the process of learning and developing needs to occur with other people  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>seek and accept stretch experiences believing in a  learn by doing  philosophy  klein and his team tells every student to seek and accept stretch experiences   you will hear students say   well  my stretch this semester is i am going to serve as the non profit board fellow for a local philadelphia organization    he says  others might lead student trips to climb a mountain in the andes or trek antarctica   if we have number one  the scholarship  and number two  the coaching  we get such impact from putting students into situations where they put these ideas into practice  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcnulty s gift will allow wharton to continue to expand and innovate in the field of leadership education while also adapting processes that have been successful in the mba program  such as the wharton leadership ventures and the executive coaching and feedback program  to new students and the public   it will also raise awareness of our approach   klein says   the school believes that this approach to leadership development is significant and has implications for leadership development around the world   </paragraph>

  <title>livewire data provides insights into hbs interview invitation results</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with round   interview invitations imminent at harvard business school  hbs   we decided to look back at what happened in round   for a little perspective  clear admit livewire reports gave us the following insights </paragraph>
    <paragraph>roughly one third of round   applicants to hbs who reported results on livewire shared that they received an invitation to interview  among those  reported gpas ranged from     to      with an average of      the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      notably  the ranges and averages were much the same for those who got a ding   the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of        after those round   interviews were conducted  here s what the data revealed </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>reported gpas for those who were admitted to the class of      at hbs ranged from     to      with an average of       the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      for those waitlisted  the ranges and averages were much the same   the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>those who didn t make the cut  meanwhile  had gpas between      and      average        and gmat scores between     and      average        those rejected from hbs were at least in good company representing    percent of livewire reports  acceptances accounted for    percent  and waitlisted applicants comprised the remaining    percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we should note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who were accepted to hbs may be more likely to share the news publicly  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t forget to look to livewire at    noon today  when invitations are slated to go out  good luck and let us know how it goes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and for those of you who got accepted to hbs in round    don t forget to check out decisionwire  our new tool that let s you share where you decide to enroll after everything s said and done </paragraph>

  <title>hbs launches new competition to improve precision medicine clinical trials</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>     billion and more than a decade of trials that s what it takes for a typical precision medical therapy to gain fda approval  the health care initiative at harvard business school  hbs   an alliance of mba students  alumni  faculty and practitioners  is hoping to drastically reduce both the time and expense of getting innovative therapies to market with a new competition designed to reimagine the clinical trials process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>precision medicine  a growing movement in patient care  allows scientists and physicians to use genomic and other information to understand diseases based on their biological mechanisms  enabling them to precisely diagnose and develop tailored treatments  the precision trials challenge  announced today  invites ideas from the medical  science  business and patient communities for ways to reinvent the clinical trials process  the goals  more rapid innovation  better targeted medicine and more effective treatments </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs is leading the charge as opposed to  say  harvard medical school  because the greatest challenges facing precision medicine are business challenges  according to hbs professor richard hamermesh   how can we develop business models that support the advancement of precision medicine  how can we get new therapies to market faster and at a lower cost  our precision trials challenge will help answer these questions by encouraging conversation and helping to put leading edge ideas into practice   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the competition is open to anyone  and applications will be accepted until march           one winner and two runners up chosen by a panel of judges will share          in prizes  and the winner will get to present his or her idea at the      personalized medicine conference  a winner will be announced in april </paragraph>
    <paragraph>funding for this new competition comes from the kraft endowment for advancing precision medicine  established last fall by a     million gift from the kraft family foundation under the leadership of its president  robert k  kraft  myra kraft  robert s wife  died of ovarian cancer in       and the family hopes through its support to help save others  lives by accelerating breakthroughs in precision medicine </paragraph>

  <title>choosing a business school for entrepreneurship</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>typing  startups are hard  into google returns approximately    million results ranging from  startups are hard in     different ways  to     reasons startups are     ing hard   perhaps that has a little something to do with why more and more savvy entrepreneurs are choosing top business schools as their training ground </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with expanding entrepreneurship curricula  cool campus startup accelerators and ever increasing numbers of business plan competitions to say nothing of the all important access to powerful networks of potential investors the mba is becoming the preferred path for many would be founders </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it stands to reason that business schools would become startup hotbeds  especially those that share a few key traits  namely a campus wide culture of collaboration and innovation  institutional support for programs that encourage technology research and interdisciplinary collaboration  and a location near a technological hub  combine these ingredients and stir  the result is a self catalyzing cycle in which campus support for commercializing technology generates local technology startups  which then draw more skilled technologists and managers to the area  who in turn provide the human resources needed to commercialize additional technologies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not surprisingly  business schools that offer some of the most robust programs to support entrepreneurship among students and alumni include those like stanford graduate school of business and uc berkeley s haas school in silicon valley  mit sloan school of management  harvard business school and babson college s f w  olin graduate school of business in the biotech hub of boston  and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  nyu stern and columbia business school along the pharmaceutical corridor between philadelphia and new york city </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but make no mistake  entrepreneurship is on fire  and even schools outside of these hubs are expanding entrepreneurial offerings in a bid to attract the next warby parker or rent the runway founders  the university of michigan s ross school of business  for example  got every first year mba student into the startup mindset by challenging them all to a business plan competition as part of orientation  northwestern s kellogg school launched an accelerator for student startups called the garage last june in a parking garage on campus  and just yesterday  ucla anderson celebrated the launch of its own anderson venture accelerator </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the pages that follow  we ll offer snapshots of the entrepreneurial programs at a few of the business schools leading the charge to support entrepreneurial students be it through courses  student clubs  business plan contests  startup incubators  mentoring programs or some combination thereof  and in the weeks ahead  look for our new series  entrepreneurship   where we ll dig deeper to uncover other ways leading business schools are supporting the founders of tomorrow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs s rock center serves as home base for entrepreneurs in an article entitled  mba programs that get you where you want to go   the new york times last spring named hbs the place to go if you want to start your own company  citing its    entrepreneurial courses     entrepreneurship professors and an annual new venture competition that awards more than          in cash and in kind prizes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and that just scratches the surface of what s on offer  supported by the arthur rock center for entrepreneurship  hbs also boasts an entrepreneurs in residence  eir  program that brings seasoned entrepreneurs and investors to campus for year long counseling engagements  the rock      a network of high impact early stage alumni entrepreneurs willing to share experiences with each other and current students  a summer fellows program that provides financial support to mba students who choose to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities between their first and second years  and a loan reduction program that awards one time  need based loan reductions between         and         to students committed to pursuing their own for profit entrepreneurial ventures upon graduation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there s also the rock accelerator program  which supports    to    founding teams each year with up to        in seed capital to apply the lean start up methodology toward developing a minimum viable product and testing out their value proposition or business model  over the course of two    week terms  teams consult with student and professional mentors  attend peer exchange workshops and focus on rapid prototyping in a race toward a final demo day wrap up session  where they share what they ve learned </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and just this month  hbs added yet another new offering to its entrepreneurial bag of tricks  with the opening of the hbs startup studio in new york city  designed to double as a co working space for eight to    hbs alumni ventures and a meeting place for hbs alumni involved in the nyc startup ecosystem  the startup studio opened in a temporary midtown location until its       square foot silicon alley space is ready later this spring  to apply  companies must have at least one hbs alumni founder  at least          in seed funding and no more than seven employees </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs s efforts to incubate successful ventures seems to be paying off  a february      analysis published by seed stage venture capital investment firm nextview ventures identified more than     founders from the hbs classes between      and       together they ve raised more than      billion for the    companies they ve launched between them  among them are u s  based e commerce trailblazers rent the runway and blue apron  health insurance disruptor oscar and an uber competitor for southeast asia called grabtaxi </paragraph>

  <title>wharton adds online specializations in entrepreneurship  financial modeling</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>touting its pioneering role in the massive online education space  the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania this week announced that it will add two new online specializations to its series of coursera offerings  one in entrepreneurship and another in business and financial modeling  this brings the school s total to    individual online courses making up four distinct specializations  more specializations than any other business school on the coursera platform  the school notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton blazed a trail in      as the first business school to offer a massive open online course  mooc   and again in      as the first to offer an online specialization  that specialization   business foundations   includes courses in marketing  accounting  finance and operations  which form the bedrock of a wharton mba  to date  more than     million students around the globe have enrolled in wharton s online offerings  says anne trumbore  director of wharton online   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school also boasts the largest number of certificates awarded to students online  with more than        going through the additional identification verification steps to certify their completion of a wharton course  trumbore adds   we have really been just thrilled with the response globally   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chance to identify unique talent why is wharton working so hard to deliver its course content to the world for free    we have the ability to provide the wharton learning experience at scale  and we feel that it is our duty to share this world class education   trumbore says  in a video about wharton online  dean geoffrey garrett cites the same primary motivation and adds two more  the opportunity to innovate with technology and a chance to draw the best students to wharton from wherever they are in the world   we probably can t always find the very best students   he says   i think that our online specializations give us the chance to identify some unique talent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  approximately    of the     students who completed the  business foundations  specialization capstone project in its first round will be offered an admissions fee waiver to apply next fall as part of wharton s round   mba application cycle  while far from a guarantee of admission  the fee waiver demonstrates wharton s commitment to helping the strongest of its online students have an opportunity to become on campus students  and for those who successfully navigate the competitive admissions process  wharton will also award up to five         scholarships </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the final course in wharton s second specialization   business analytics   was only launched last week  so students haven t had an opportunity to take part in a capstone project and no reward has been designated for the highest performers  trumbore says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>top entrepreneurship students to score audience with vcs the new  entrepreneurship  specialization announced today will also offer a reward to the top online performers  the learners with the top scores on the capstone project will be introduced to the most appropriate venture capital  vc  firms in wharton entrepreneurship s network  according to region and sector </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the process to select these students will mirror the one used for the  foundations  specialization   students will be peer reviewed they will use a rubric developed by the professors to evaluate one another   trumbore says  the teaching staff will hand grade the highest scoring of this lot to identify an elite group to present to the entrepreneurship professors  who will make introductions to appropriate vcs  she continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>entrepreneurship was a natural next addition to wharton s coursera offerings given the school s deep history of innovation and entrepreneurial success stories such as indian online marketplace snapdeal and online eyeglass retailer warby parker  trumbore says   we also have some of the world s best professors  so it seemed like that would be a really good specialization to bring to a global audience   its courses will tackle key topics in the conception  design  organization and management of new ventures and be taught by superstars on the wharton faculty  including karl ulrich  lori rosenkopf  kartik hosanger  david hsu  david bell  laura huang and ethan mollick </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton s not worried about cannibalization that is  online learners eating into a population of students who might otherwise apply to and enroll in the school s premier two year mba program   i really don t think that someone who has the commitment to even consider coming to an mba program for two years would be satisfied with a    week course of study online   trumbore says   they are just very different types of learners   the more likely outcome  she says  is that the specialization will draw people who have an entrepreneurial idea they want to develop  who then decide they want to apply for the full mba program   it s not an  either or  situation   she says </paragraph>

  <title> insead knocks hbs from top spot in financial times      global mba rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>insead jumped three spots to claim no    in the financial times      global mba rankings  released today  knocking reigning harvard business school  hbs  to no     the global business school which features campuses in france  singapore and abu dhabi has been on an upward trajectory over the past few years  sidling from sixth to fifth to fourth  but this year marks the first time it has claimed the top spot   incidentally  it s also the first one year mba program to ever do so  hbs  for its part  held steady at no    each of the past three years and has taken top honors six times since the ft s rankings debuted in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs wasn t the only school displaced by insead s upward climb  london business school  lbs  was knocked back down to third from the second place spot it claimed last year  the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania also backslid a spot  to fourth  and stanford graduate school of business  which shared fourth with insead last year  fell to fifth   the ft compiles its annual global mba rankings based on two surveys  one of the business schools themselves and another of their alumni   for this year s rankings  alumni who graduated in      were surveyed   based on the responses to these surveys  the mba programs are ranked according to the career progression of their alumni  the school s idea generation and the diversity of students and faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the average salary for insead alumni three years out from graduation was           amounting to almost double     percent  pre mba salary  the other schools in the top five were in roughly the same ballpark on both measures  but insead left them in the dust in terms of  value for money   here the difference between insead s one year program requiring less time out of the workforce and lower program fees and the other top schools  two year programs was stark  insead ranked   th overall for value  while the four runners up were all in the bottom quarter  insead  which calls itself  the business school for the world   also ranked well for its international course experience  fifth  and for the international mobility of its graduates  third  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>across all schools  mba graduates from the class of      earned an average salary of          three years after graduation  up just slightly from last year s           but the pay increase associated with completing the degree jumped more significantly  graduates surveyed as part of this year s rankings reported earning an average of    percent more three years out than at the start of their programs  compared to    percent last year  seven schools reported average salary increases of more than     percent  contributing to the jump  still  it s off from past pay hikes  which reached a high of     percent in      and      and     percent as recently as      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>insead s top performance aside  u s  schools dominated the rankings much as they have in past years  accounting for    of the     schools in the global list  that said  this year s list did include nine new entries from six countries  and global schools have a strong foothold among the top     with insead and lbs joined by spain s iese and ie  as well as china s ciebs and hkust  the united kingdom s judge school of business and france s hec paris </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  those of us here at clear admit encourage prospective applicants to use a school s performance in these and other rankings as just one of many measurements to determine the mba program that will best fit your individual needs </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  triumphant reapplicant gains admission at ucla anderson</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>if at first you don t succeed  try  try again  our fridays from the frontline contributor this week took these words to heart  reapplying in fall      after an unsuccessful application process the year before  a young female indian engineer  she had relatively strong scores and grades  but not a ton of experience under her belt  read on to learn some of the steps she took to strengthen her application the second time around gaining admission at ucla anderson </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while happy to share her story with the clear admit audience  she wants to remain anonymous until she actually matriculates  so until then  we ll just refer to her as the pull that mba trigger blogger   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  pull that mba trigger </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what changed this time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>okay  so let s look at the cold  hard facts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my gmat score stayed the same       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my gpa is the same as well        </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the last time i checked  i was still an indian engineer </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my work experience moved up from about    months to    months </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my job title is now  product manager  and not the dreaded  software engineer  it was before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my post mba goal looks legit now because i have the experience to back it up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a senior colleague at my new job wrote what i can only assume was a stellar letter of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>let me tell ya  i had to work my butt off to transition from being a code monkey to someone making actual product decisions  i must have applied to nearly a     places and interviewed at about    until i finally got the job i wanted  but i persevered because i knew that mba or not  this was where i wanted my career to go </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i guess the lesson here is  don t let the fact that you got rejected bring you down  if you are a reapplicant like i was   the lofty goals that you d written about in your essay  you can still get closer to achieving them without an mba  by self selection  most applicants are ambitious  go getters who honestly don t need an mba to get where they want to go  of course  if you still think business school is right for you  then your application will be stronger than it ever was before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>apart from switching jobs  i also narrowed down my goals even further  previously  my short term goal was to  work in company x as a pm   i changed that to  work in company x s y division as a pm   i backed it up with very relevant experience that i had and tied it in neatly to my long term goal  i m sure it wasn t a huge distinction  but it became super relevant during my interview  where surprisingly enough i spoke to a second year student who had a ton of knowledge about my field of interest  odd because it s quite a niche area   i believe that this worked in my favour since i was immediately able to establish common ground and our conversation centered more around the latest developments in that industry than the usual  tell me how you   stuff </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  in my reapplicant essay  i called out what i believed were the weaknesses in my application  i addressed the age work experience thing head on  i made a stronger connection between my short term and long term goals and finally  i mentioned in passing the gazillion students  alums and admissions officers i d spoken to over an entire year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  i do want to caveat this by saying that i did pretty much the same things i mentioned above in my reapplication to fuqua as well  but surprise surprise  i got dinged without an interview  there is a pretty big element of luck involved  plus the relative quality and composition of the applicant pool  so there is no  fool proof  method to this madness  it s just doing the best you can and hoping for the best </paragraph>

  <title> hbs hypes gender initiative launched last spring</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  today took to its mba voices blog to introduce the hbs gender initiative to those who may not be familiar with it  established in fall       the initiative s public launch took place in may       coinciding with the release of interesting research coming out of hbs related to gender issues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that research included a study published last spring by hbs professor kathleen mcginn that pinpointed advantages enjoyed by children of working mothers  surveying        adults in    countries  she and her colleagues found that the daughters of working mothers completed more years of education  had higher rates of employment and were more likely both to supervise others and earn higher incomes than those of moms who stayed at home in a staggering    of the    countries studied  sons of working moms  while their careers were not measurably impacted  were found to contribute more time each week to childcare and housework which research has shown to increase women s involvement in the workforce and perhaps impact the stability of marriages   there are very few things  that we know of  that have such a clear effect on gender inequality as being raised by a working mother   mcginn said in a statement when the research was released </paragraph>
    <paragraph>later that same month  hbs senior associate dean for culture and community robin ely released her own research on the toll that a      work culture takes on families and gender equality   these      work cultures lock gender inequality in place  because the work family balance is recognized primarily as a women s problem   ely told the new york times   the very well intentioned answer is to give women benefits  but it actually derails women s careers  the culture of overwork affects everybody  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gender initiative seeks to bring research findings to bear on discussions of gender ely leads the new gender initiative at hbs  which is designed to bring together precisely this type of research taking place at harvard and help ensure its dissemination throughout the hbs community  placing this rigorous research at the fingertips of hbs s students will equip them to ground discussions about gender in fact  helping people make better informed decisions as they relate to themselves  their families  their companies and their communities  ely said in may </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on a grander scale  the gender initiative s mission is  to accelerate the advancement of women leaders and promote gender equity in business and society   according to the recent mba voices blog post  but recognizing that gender shapes the lives of both men and women and often intersects other axes of inequality race  ethnicity  class  sexual orientation  to name but a few those involved with the initiative view their work as extending beyond simply addressing women s underrepresentation in leadership </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to supporting related research and its dissemination  the gender initiative will also focus on course development  case writing and building a community devoted to advancing women leaders and gender equity  a conference that in fact predated the gender initiative the gender   work symposium  held each spring will help with the community building  bringing together academics and practitioners to share research and ideas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition  the gender initiative is working to develop new ways to share insights via video  print and social media  its webpage serves as a central repository  the initiative is also leading a major  ongoing study of the career and life paths hbs alumni choose  called  life and leadership after hbs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to today s post on the mba voices blog  one of the greatest challenges facing the hbs gender initiative s efforts are stereotypes that misinform public opinion about gender   unfortunately  much of the conventional wisdom about gender and other identity categories are rooted in stereotypes and other beliefs that are not supported by the evidence   read the post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as an example  the research released last may by hbs s mcginn showing clear advantages for children of working mothers flies in the face of still prevalent perceptions that the increase in working moms is bad for society  indeed  a recent pew research study found that    percent of adults held the negative view  compared to only    percent who saw more working moms as a positive  these kinds of discrepancies between public opinion and fact borne out by research are precisely what the gender initiative hopes to combat </paragraph>
    <paragraph> grounding the conversation about diversity in rigorous research is essential to moving forward and making meaningful progress in our organizations and society more broadly   read today s post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the hbs gender initiative has the staunch support of hbs dean nitin nohria  nohria  appointed in      by drew gilpin faust  harvard s first ever female president  has pledged since joining the business school to help redefine gender relations on campus  in january       nohria promised to increase the number of female protagonists in hbs case studies from   to    percent by      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when the gender initiative launched publicly last spring  he noted hbs s leadership role in defining the roles and functions of business and effective business practice   with the launch of this initiative  we want to have a similar and lasting impact on the way the world understands and acts upon gender related matters   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stay tuned for subsequent posts  in which we ll drill down to see whether and how the hbs gender initiative is measurably changing the experience of mba students at the school as well as what other leading business schools are doing as they square off against the issue of gender equity </paragraph>

  <title>darden partners with bunker labs dc to support veteran led companies</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>making up between seven and nine percent of the mba class each year  military veterans are a significant part of the university of virginia darden school of business fabric   veterans enrich our learning community   wrote darden professor and dean emeritus bob bruner in a veteran s day blog post a few years back   we actively seek excellent students from the ranks of the military   that s because like other leading business schools  darden recognizes that many skills honed in the military such as leadership  discipline  teamwork and decision making transfer seamlessly to the mba classroom </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but why stop at the mba classroom  as part of a pilot program launched last semester  darden faculty  alumni and second year mba students have partnered with a veteran focused business accelerator to offer entrepreneurship training to veteran led companies in and around washington  dc  led by darden professor greg fairchild  a rotating group of alumni and students started teaching entrepreneurship courses at bunker labs dc in august  seven veteran led businesses graduated from the program in december  and a new cohort will start in february </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the child of a career army artillery office  fairchild has first hand insight into both the challenges veterans can face and the unique strengths they can bring to bear as entrepreneurs   i knew that  basically  things were challenging for veterans  more than most people recognize   fairchild said in an article on the darden website   on the other hand  i knew that it was a population that includes people who move people and machinery and have led  and so you can see the ways that people who are veterans make a lot of sense as business people  and more specifically as entrepreneurs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fairchild  who also teaches entrepreneurship courses with darden students to inmates in area prisons  is always looking for ways to broaden the darden circle   this is what we re about in terms of bringing high quality education to people who are really at a life inflection point   he said as part of the article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden network helps launch capitol post bunker labs is housed at capitol post  an organization designed to unite the dc veteran business community  capitol post director emily mcmahan  a      graduate of darden s executive mba program  was approached by fellow emba classmate stephanie landrum  president and ceo of the alexandria economic development partnership  to launch the organization   when i met emily  she had already made her transition from military service to entrepreneurship and as cfo  i saw how she used the darden curriculum to help grow the company   landrum said in the darden website article   with her background as a veteran  an entrepreneur and a darden grad  i knew she was the perfect person to help design  build and launch the program  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to landrum  capitol post evaluated a number of programs as potential partners for running the entrepreneurship courses before choosing darden   we were very excited to find a way to include darden and work with the faculty and students to customize some of the best parts of our darden experience to now share with the veteran business owners we are working with   landrum said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcmahan stressed to the seven companies in the initial cohort that it was a pilot program   we have a product and an offering  and we told them we would be tweaking it   she said as part of the darden website article   for our next class in february  we are really excited for the programming and line up of companies we ve attracted  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to mcmahan  bunker labs is seeking startups led by veterans or veteran spouses that have an innovative concept and address a clear market need  the hope is that with the accelerator s support  they will grow into sustainable  scalable businesses  while intended as a resource for the veteran community and active duty military  the next cohort will also include a few civilian led startups </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among those companies in the first cohort were one startup designed to help military families find places to live and another that helped train schools to prepare for and handle threatening situations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applying the case method to real life businesses using the case method darden is known for  the student instructors teach the participating entrepreneurs business concepts and theory  which they can then immediately put into action in their businesses   it s amazing to be able to bring darden to a program where the rubber meets the road   said mcmahan   they re really applying what they learn from these cases in the now  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fairchild agrees   these people are really dealing with real things   he said   we ve worked closely with emily on figuring out how to get the right mix of theory and case and workshop  but i think we have a great partner who s open to learning how to do that best  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second year mba student bryan yoon  one of the current teachers in the program  is also a veteran himself  having spent eight years as an intelligence officer in the u s  army before coming to darden  a member of the darden military association  he appreciates the opportunity to remain connected and give back to fellow veterans   there s a particular set of experiences and a vernacular that accompany those experiences that only the people in that room are going to be able to understand  and there s a unique opportunity to connect that to businesses   he said in the darden piece </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fairchild hopes the program will only continue to grow  aided by the large veteran population in washington  which provides a rich talent pool </paragraph>

  <title>new mba decisionwire feature debuts on clear admit</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>for all the devoted livewire followers out there  we ve got some exciting news to share  clear admit this week has added a new feature designed to let mba applicants  students and alumni share more information with their peers specifically where they decide to attend business school based on where they applied and were accepted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this new tool  called mba decisionwire  provides profiles and school selection information updates in real time from your peers as they make the all important decision of where to actually pursue their mba  users can filter others  submissions by the schools applied to  admitted to and enrolled at  as well as by application year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of the people who got into both harvard and stanford in round    where are most ultimately planning to go  how does that compare to previous years  when deciding between columbia  nyu stern and chicago booth for investment banking  who chooses which school  how many schools did other applicants apply to  of those  how many did they gain admission to  these are but a few of the data points decisionwire helps you extract </paragraph>
    <paragraph>decisionwire also invites those who submit to share their gpa and gmat scores  as well as their intended post mba career  a notes section lets people include any factors that may have influenced their final decision  such as financial aid  size of student body  location or a given school s track record for placing graduates in a chosen industry  in essence  each entry will tell an individual s story from starting the application process to setting foot on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though only just launched  decisionwire has already drawn dozens of submissions revealing a range of interesting details   culture fit was a deciding factor for me as was sloan s emphasis on entrepreneurship   wrote a      applicant focused on tech who enrolled at mit sloan after applying to haas  hbs  mit sloan and stanford gsb and gaining admission to all but stanford </paragraph>
    <paragraph> london is just an amazing city that i d love to spend     years living in not to mention the networking opportunities   wrote an applicant from this year who has enrolled at london business school  choosing it over cambridge s judge school of business and hec paris  which also offered him or her admission </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another applicant from this year applied to dual degree programs at each fuqua  ross and kellogg   chose northwestern s jd mba   the candidate shared   ultimately  business school ranking and career opportunities were the greatest influencer despite having received very generous scholarship opportunities from duke and michigan  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we re thrilled to launch decisionwire and hope you ll enjoy using it  of course  it stands to grow even more interesting and valuable as more submissions roll in  a frequently asked questions page provides additional information about the tool  but if you have any additional questions or feedback  please contact dw clearadmit com </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontlines  kellogg mbas take silicon valley</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>welcome back to fridays from the frontlines  where each week we feature the perspectives of current mba applicants  students and recent alumni wherever they are in the trajectory of business school  today we re pleased to feature a post from luke murphy  a first year mba candidate at northwestern s kellogg school of management  who recently led a group of fellow students on a trek to san francisco startups  he was a good one to help organize the trip  having grown up in the bay area and worked there for years before business school  most recently as director of business development at nasdaq in san francisco  but as you ll see in the post that follows  even he was surprised by some of what the trip revealed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though places like stanford graduate school of business and uc berkeley s haas school provide some distinct advantages to those targeting silicon valley as a post mba career destination  kellogg s trek and others like it organized by schools elsewhere in the country and the world help make this attractive industry attainable to a wide array of graduates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  the inside perspective  kellogg s full time mba student blog   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>behind the scenes with san francisco startups over thanksgiving break this year  i helped lead a group of    kellogg mba students to visit eight startup companies in san francisco  zenefits  nerdwallet  stitchfix  dropbox  hoteltonight  doubledutch  toutapp and instacart  the trip was a way for us to learn about the well known silicon valley startup culture  network with employers and squeeze in sightseeing of a city many students had never visited </paragraph>
    <paragraph>raised in the bay area and having worked in san francisco for the previous six years  i thought i knew what to expect from the meetings we set up  i expected   and did hear   terms like    x thinking  challenge conventional wisdom  no competition  industry disruption and ride together die together  seriously   but there were also themes that surprised me  here are a few </paragraph>
    <paragraph>value of an mba before going to business school  i read countless articles about whether to get an mba before joining a startup  many said the best route is to dive right into a startup and  learn by doing   thus  i was surprised to hear that almost all the startups we visited were actively hiring mbas  in fact  many of the executives we met with also came from the consulting industry  we were told the demand for mba talent stems from the need for  consumer iq   as well as an operational mindset  and the ability to think strategically  analyze data and motivate team members </paragraph>
    <paragraph>relentless focus on the customer  every company we met with was aggressively focused on the customer  which reminds me of the first thing i learned in my core marketing class  if you don t know the answer  ask the customer  doubledutch co founder and ceo lawrence coburn discussed his difficult  yet keen decision early on to do one thing really well and focus on that  it would be impossible and expensive to serve multiple markets well  likewise  he advised that future founders document values early  this was refreshing to hear at a time when the tech industry has received bad pr regarding privacy  data collection and gender discrimination  the focus on values resonates with today s consumers who are more concerned than ever with corporate social responsibility  for example  hoteltonight doesn t collect any data it doesn t need  and nerdwallet ceo tim chen recalled sacrificing short term profits from google ads for long term growth and brand equity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>big company experience is good i thought startups would value other startup experience  but it turns out they value big company experience just as much  at stitchfix  a personalized styling platform for women  the executives previously worked at companies like gap  old navy  macy s and sephora  toutapp recently hired frank swain  the former vp of sales at appdynamics and splunk  as chief revenue officer to take the company to the next level  the rationale was that you get formal training at big companies  while at startups you get on the job training with the need for resourcefulness and a sense of urgency </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here is some other advice we received </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on company fit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on interviewing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on founding </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the alumni we met with reinforced the value of kellogg s experiential learning opportunities to build our resume while at business school  private equity lab provides hands on experience with private equity firms  while venture lab offers exposure to venture capital firms and their portfolio companies  in  nuvention  courses  students can explore entrepreneurial business concepts in areas such as social impact  medical innovations  energy  web  analytics and nanotechnology  kellogg even has designated co working space at      in downtown chicago where you can work alongside other founders </paragraph>

  <title> best bets for banking  business schools that help land jobs at prestige firms</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>admittedly  the percentage of mba students clamoring for jobs in investment banking is not what it once was  thanks       global financial crisis  nevertheless  the allure of exciting  highly compensated work that provides an opportunity to advance at break neck speed in terms of both responsibility and pay still makes many a job seeking mba student weak in the knees </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with annual starting salaries around          to say nothing of standard bonuses and other compensation investment banking draws a significant portion of graduating mbas at many top schools  and it s not just about the money  heading into investment banking also lets you work with c level executives right from the start  involves rubbing elbows with some of the most powerful people in business  provides a well defined career path for those who opt to stay in the industry and offers an array of jumping off opportunities  be it with client companies or starting your own firm </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we get it  there are a lot of great reasons to want to work in investment banking  so  if that s your prerogative  how do you choose a business school that will help you land the best possible job  good news  we ve dug into the data to help you figure it out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>latest school placement statistics there are many factors to take into consideration when you re trying to decide which business school will best position you to get the investment banking job you want  a good place to start can be looking at which schools send the greatest percentage of their students into the industry  while it can be argued that more students vying for spots in a given industry may mean greater competition  student appetite can also influence the resources schools allocate toward placing graduates in said industry  as well as the recruitment dollars spent by investment banking firms looking to snap those students up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>long gone are the days when investment banking rivaled consulting at most top schools as a prized destination for mba grads  columbia business school  cbs   which sent a whopping      percent into banking in       sent just      percent in       slightly outpacing cbs was the university of chicago booth school of business  where      percent followed the investment banking path  representing a slight uptick over the prior year s class       percent   but while certainly a more distant second to consulting  investment banking still remains the second most sought after career path at both schools  and many others  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of salaries  cbs      grads boasted a median starting salary of          with median other compensation totaling          at chicago booth  the median starting salary was also           and the median starting bonus was          here  too  investment banking holds its own against almost every other industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the front runner by far in terms of percentage of students heading into i banking was new york university s stern school of business  where the industry drew almost one in four      graduates     percent   that school s physical proximity to new york s famed financial district surely can t hurt  we should note  though  that this is down from    percent in      and    percent in       bucking the trend at cbs and booth  where interest in investment banking seems to be on an upward trajectory after a precipitous fall following the great recession  in terms of earning power  the mean base salary for      stern grads heading into investment banking was           together with a mean signing bonus of         and mean other guaranteed bonus of          this made for average overall compensation packages north of          </paragraph>

  <title>pepsico ceo endows yale som deanship with landmark gift</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>pepsico chairperson and ceo indra k  nooyi this week became the most generous lifetime benefactor in the history of her alma mater  the yale school of management  som   endowing the deanship of the school and kicking off the fifth decade innovation fund  the school announced yesterday </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my experience at the yale school of management forever altered the course of my life   the      yale som graduate said in a statement   my gift to this wonderful institution pales in comparison with the gift that yale gave me the fundamental understanding that leadership requires an expansive worldview and a deep appreciation of the many points of intersection between business and society   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ceo of pepsico since      and chairman since       nooyi has spearheaded  performance with purpose   the company s promise to integrate sustainability and social impact into its pursuit of exceptional financial performance  as part of this initiative  pepsico has diversified its product portfolio to meet changing consumer needs so that just    percent of its global revenue comes from carbonated soft drinks and    percent comes from the company s nutrition businesses  nooyi has also helped pepsico become a leader in sustainability  including reducing operational water use by    percent and improving operational energy efficiency by    percent since      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>edward snyder  who has led yale som since      and was reappointed to a second term as dean earlier this month  is the inaugural indra k  nooyi dean   having the deanship named in her honor communicates to the world the school s model of purposeful and broadminded leadership   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale som did not disclose the amount of nooyi s gift but shared that it will not only endow the deanship but also inaugurate the fifth decade innovation fund commemorating the school s entry into its fifth decade  the fund is designed  to advance the school s aim of developing leaders with the broad global mindset and multi disciplinary approach to business that is needed to succeed in   st century capitalism   according to the yale som website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it will fund the development of technology and other infrastructure to support innovative initiatives such as the school s focus on the connections between the private and public sectors  its integrated curriculum and its participation in the global network for advanced management  the fund will also help support the school s recently launched one year post mba degree  the master of advanced management  and increased emphasis on entrepreneurship through the program on entrepreneurship </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business issues are never just business issues  and my most ardent hope is that this endowment will teach future generations of leaders that the most successful companies of tomorrow will do more than make money   nooyi stated   they will make a difference and create shareholder value by improving the quality of life in every market in which they operate  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nooyi s most recent gift is the first by a woman to endow deanship at a top business school  yale som notes  though far from her first gift to the school  her prior contributions help fund construction of edward p  evans hall  which opened one year ago  and included gifts to name the nooyi classroom and the isaacson classroom in memory of professor larry isaacson </paragraph>

  <title>wharton professors examine what makes mbas happy</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>professors matthew bidwell and ethan mollick of the wharton school of business of the university of pennsylvania were recently acknowledged for their historic study on the happiness of entrepreneurs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the team discovered  after surveying        mba graduates over a span of years  that those who ended up running their own businesses ranked themselves happiest  a recent article by martin zwilling in forbes noted the professors  research  along with a list of tips for those entering the workplace as entrepreneurs </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>these pieces of advice include  do what you love and love what you do  stay in the present  possess realistic expectations  prioritize family time  keep track of successes  practice positive health habits  have an outlet for stress  trust your employees  pay attention to both sides of the brain  and have an optimistic approach </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bidwell and mollick found through their research that business owners who created startups that weren t initially successful even reported greater happiness with their decisions  their study  originally published in         contradicted the old saying that money cannot buy happiness  the more money someone earned  the happier they tended to be  the older respondents also tended to be happier than the younger ones  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mollick said   people tend to view entrepreneurship as an end state  that doesn t seem to explain what people actually do   noting that people tend  in the real world  to fluctuate between working for someone and running their own business  one of the most striking aspects of the team s study was the reality that in the modern economy  change is a fact of life </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even workers with high prestige credentials  including mbas from schools such as wharton  should expect to remain adaptable and should understand the necessity of reinvention in an unpredictable economy </paragraph>

  <title>anderson mbas win big in renewable energy competition</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this article has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a team of mba students from ucla s anderson school of management won first place last month in the renewable energy case competition  recc  at the university of michigan s ross school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>competitors included mba candidates from top schools in the united states and internationally </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>this year s case study centered around an issue that is facing the renewable energy industry that of the development of community solar projects  community solar provides retailers and consumers with the opportunity to purchase a portion of a solar  garden  which is shared among people who aren t able to install solar panels of their own due to the expense or to the nature of their property ownership </paragraph>
    <paragraph>teams in the recc were challenged to form a startup company that would fill this niche in the solar energy industry  they were asked to make two presentations to a group of venture capital investors in advance of the competition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perfectstorm  anderson s team  was comprised of three first year full time mba candidates  makibi takagi  dan komula and akhil modi  and two second year femba candidates  manoj rawat and alex wehrmann  the team s solution to the case study was to enlist retailers such as target and walmart in states that provide renewable energy credits to their residents  the proposal involved the retailers installing solar gardens on the rooftops of their stores and allowing customers to purchase portions of the energy from them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the anderson mbas noted the mutual benefit to customers and the retailers themselves  who would drive up loyalty through this unique program    installation of the solar gardens  would also demonstrate  the retailers s  corporate social responsibility to the customer and allow the customer to benefit from this   notes an article on anderson s blog </paragraph>

  <title>choose your own gmat adventure  gmac pilots new  select section order  option for exam</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>for many  feeling like you re in the driver s seat can make almost any experience better  but even the gmat  the graduate management admission council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmat exam  plans to find out as part of a new pilot program that will give a select group of test takers the ability to choose the order of the exam sections they complete </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit has obtained a copy of an email sent by gmac to recent test takers inviting them to participate in the  exclusive  invitation only opportunity   the testing period of the pilot is limited and expected to run from february   rd through march  th        according to the email  although exact test dates will vary depending on test center availability and other logistics  apart from participants getting to choose the order of the sections  the pilot exam experience will be identical to any other gmat exam  with standard test center policies and registration fees in place  as long as you accept your score at the conclusion of the pilot  it will be recorded as a legitimate score and included in all future score reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>small sample size for select section order pilot   participants in the pilot will get to choose from four options in terms of the order in which they tackle the respective quantitative  verbal  analytical writing and integrated reasoning sections of the test  optional breaks will be offered before and after each of the longer quant and verbal sections  the table below represents the four available options  with corresponding optional breaks </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>source  www mba com</paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to an faq page about the pilot on www mba com  invitations to participate were sent to a randomly selected subset of candidates who had registered on mba com with previously canceled gmat scores  the invited pool represents less than   percent of the total testing volume the minimum required to obtain meaningful results  according to gmac  given the small sample size  the pilot is not expected to impact the admissions pool for schools  since the chance that any individual school will receive a substantial number of pilot scores is  extremely unlikely   notes gmac </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the wider launch of the select section order feature will depend greatly on the results of the pilot   gmac wrote in its invitation to participants   gmac may decide not to launch the feature for any number of reasons  including candidate dissatisfaction   depending on participation levels  gmac may opt to send out additional invitations to take part at a later time  no schedule for further release of the select section order feature has been determined </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>how many times have you heard someone liken pursuing an mba to drinking from a fire hose  between the coursework  student clubs  networking  recruiting there aren t enough hours in the day  now imagine doing it as mom to a three year old </paragraph>
    <paragraph>katie colgary is a second year student doing precisely that juggling motherhood and the mba at harvard business school  hbs   she graciously agreed to share this recent blog post with clear admit s readers  in which she reveals how she does it  as well as what resources are in place at hbs to help make doing it possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph>colgary is clearly no stranger to challenges  before coming to hbs  she spent seven and a half years as a nuclear warfare officer in the u s  navy  she left the navy in later       welcomed son lincoln not long after and spent two years at home with him before joining the hbs class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we found her post incredibly inspiring  and also packed with great practical tips for other women contemplating juggling motherhood and the mba  we think you ll enjoy it  too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  the harvard business school mba voices admissions blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what do you enjoy most about being a mom </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my husband and i have one smart and adorable little boy  his name is lincoln  and he is a charmer  he just turned three earlier this month  my favorite thing about parenthood is sharing the experiences with my husband and watching lincoln develop into an inquisitive and engaging little kid  the dinner conversations we have now are quite entertaining </paragraph>
    <paragraph>were you nervous about juggling motherhood and the full time mba program  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>absolutely  the transition from full time mom to full time student was not easy  fortunately  my husband is the most supportive guy ever  and we have been able to share the parenting load  i would not be able to do this without his support and encouragement  we do not have any family in the area  and although we are used to moving around frequently and not being near family  it has been more challenging now that we have a child to care for </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the logistics aren t always easy  but most of the time they are worth it  some students have fomo   fear of missing out   and worry about missing out on the plethora of social activities during rc year  i have the other kind of fomo  i worry constantly about what milestones i might be missing and what my son is learning and doing during the day </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fortunately  i realize that my decision to pursue an mba at hbs is an investment in his future as well as my own and there s nothing as sweet as hearing him say   mommy goes to hahvahd  i want to go to hahvahd  in his mini boston accent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>have you connected with other women on campus who are getting their mba while being moms </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of my closest friends and classmates is another student mom  annette  she has two little ones and is a complete rock star  we met through one of the facebook groups before starting rc year  and have been friends ever since  annette and i have very different backgrounds  but since there are so few of us moms  we have gotten a chance to connect and learn from each other </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what kinds of resources are available for student moms on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the crimson parents  student club  is a great group of students and their partners  it is a wonderful resource should you choose to live on campus  particularly if you have a partner who will be at home during the week with your little one </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are not a lot of student moms  at last count  i believe there were seven in the class of        and many of us live off campus and have partners who work  or study   full time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is an informal groupme that was formed by one of our expectant moms  and we use it as a message board to coordinate occasional meetups and answer questions amongst the group </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are also two breastfeeding support rooms  pumping rooms  on campus  i was able to use them during the application process and during campus visits  as well as once school started  they are under lock and key but available for use by the entire community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what child care options are available on campus and in boston </paragraph>
    <paragraph>boston has some of the highest childcare costs in the country  wait lists for daycare can be over a year long  it is imperative that you look into daycare as soon as you are even considering coming to hbs  especially if considering the on campus daycare center  it s always in high demand although students do get a higher  priority  in the wait list  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are tons of private daycare options in the neighborhoods surrounding hbs  i live in davis square  and my son is in an excellent program there  the crimson parents club keeps a  babysitter reference  list  as well as some passed along info on local child care options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>do you live on or off campus  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i lived off campus in davis square prior to applying to hbs and still live there now </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you are moving to boston for hbs and you have a co parenting partner that does not work  i would highly suggest living on campus  the support for partners on campus is great </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you have a working partner  you might consider living off campus  where there are more convenient and accessible childcare options and easy access to the  t   the boston subway train system   although i did not participate in most of the weekday  late night  social scene  i was able to be involved in events that were important to me  despite living off campus  we loved coming to friendsgiving  holidazzle  section retreat and several other amazing events with the pandas of section a </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what s the best advice you received about coming to business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you are a mom and want to come get your mba at hbs  you should  but you really  really need to want it  when things get tough at home  as they always do with growing children   you need to be able to focus to get your work done  too  this means sleepless nights and stressed out mornings  many of your classmates just won t be able to relate  but that s okay   this is not about them  this is about you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what advice would you give to moms considering coming to hbs   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>apply and then start really planning  make sure you have your  parenting support system  figured out well in advance of day   whether it s a stay at home partner  daycare center  nanny or family member  while hbs might offer you admission into the mba program  they won t set up every aspect of your life for you  you need to be proactive and get your ducks in a row ahead of time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck  and reach out if you need help </paragraph>

  <title>employment stats reveal banner year for tuck class of      mbas</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as today s   p m  round   deadline approaches  are you furiously putting the finishing touches on your application to the tuck school of business  the school s most recent career statistics suggest that the effort you put into gaining admission to tuck should more than pay off when it comes time to look for a job </paragraph>
    <paragraph>late last month  the school shared details about where the tuck class of      graduates have landed and with a staggering    percent of them securing job offers within three months of graduation  it made for a record breaking year  add to that the fact that median base salaries jumped by eight percent  to           and the tuck career development office  cdo  can certainly feel good about the work it s doing </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s a good year   jonathan masland  cdo executive director  said modestly in an article on the tuck website   the secret to it is that everyone in our office gets to know each student so we can connect them with the right knowledge and people for their chosen career path   he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>drilling down into the career stats reveals that the overall distribution of students by business sector and industry remains much the same as it was last year  more than a third     percent  of tuck s      grads headed into consulting roles  down just slightly from last year s    percent  industry giants mckinsey   company  bain   company and the boston consulting group snapped up    students  or    percent of the overall class </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the financial services sector drew    percent of the class the second largest slice of the employment pie  these included jobs in investment banking  investment management  private equity and venture capital </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tech followed not far behind  with firms including microsoft  google and amazon hiring    percent of graduates  the growth in tech jobs coming out of tuck as well as many other mba programs has been significant in recent years  six or seven years ago  less than    percent of tuck graduates sought jobs in the technology sector  the school notes  masland credits the increases not merely to strength in tech hiring  but also to resources and opportunities the school offers to students interested in tech careers  one example is the silicon valley boot camp  an event organized by the cdo each year that lets incoming students explore tech related career opportunities while networking with employers and alumni in the industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>companies in the retail and consumer package goods  cpg  sectors wooed more tuck graduates than they have in the past     percent of the latest class  up from seven the year before  one such graduate  juan giovaneli  took a position at colgate palmolive  successfully using his time at tuck to transition from corporate communications to marketing  today he is an assistant brand manager at the huge cpg firm  completing a rotational program that will expose him to various different parts of the business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the efforts of the cdo  tuck graduates also credit the strength of the tuck alumni network for their successful career searches  another student  erica johnston  chose tuck for its strength in general management and marketing  hoping to transition from a job in manufacturing into a career she could be passionate about in the food industry   food allergies meant that all her life she d had to pay close attention to what she eats  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>guided by the cdo  she connected with a tuck alumna  lauren tankersley  mba     who helped arrange a summer internship for her in denver working for whitewave foods  the maker of silk soy milk  where tankersley is a marketing director  the power of the tuck alumni network didn t stop there  another alumna  sue allon  mba      who is a member of the tuck board of overseers and lives in denver extended an offer to johnston to live at her house for the summer and use her extra car   i was just blown away   johnston said in the article on the tuck website   to have a place to call home for the summer that was rent free  and a family to live with  it was just a wonderful experience  </paragraph>

  <title>average gmat  gpa scores for round   livewire entries  how do you measure up </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>while entries continue to trickle in  the volume on clear admit s livewire has slowed no real surprise given where we are in the mba admissions cycle  the vast majority of applicants in round   have received decisions from their target schools  round   applicants  meanwhile  are focused on wrapping things up with their applications as deadlines fill the days and weeks ahead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the relative lull has given us a chance to dig into the data submitted by applicants over the course of round    which we thought the clear admit audience might find interesting  for starters  we ve computed average reported gmat score and gpa for candidates who shared that they were admitted in round   at each of the    schools we track </paragraph>
    <paragraph> shocker  the ultra selective stanford graduate school of business topped the charts on both counts  with an average gmat score of     and an average gpa of        but the self reported stats were incredibly strong across the board  underscoring what a feat it is to gain admission to these leading mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as with all of our livewire analysis  we should note that our sample size is small and likely subject to some response bias  but we think it s pretty interesting nonetheless </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stay tuned for subsequent posts as we parse the round   data further  we ll let you know which school drew the most livewire responses overall  which school placed the greatest percentage of round   applicants on the waitlist and more </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  the hec paris mba experience with footnotes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>happy      everyone  today in fridays from the frontline  we re featuring a post submitted to us by prashant khorana about his hec paris mba experience  on twitter  khorana   prashantkhorana  describes himself as a data scientist mathematician who is passionate about analytics  economics  finance  leadership and investing and who hates unproductive activities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>titled  brief notes on the hec paris mba experience   the post is nonetheless longer than we generally publish here especially with the footnotes  which khorana doesn t want you to miss  so we ve offered you a taste to whet your appetite and encourage you to follow the link below to read the post in its entirety  he covers everything you ve ever wondered about hec paris  from getting in to settling in  from learning french to surviving st  cyr and triumphing at mbat  many thanks to khorana for sharing his experience with the clear admit audience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished from its original source  open strategist </paragraph>
    <paragraph>consider the mba  brief notes on the hec paris mba experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here s a didactic little parable you ve probably heard before  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there was once a powerful king who ruled many parts of the world  one day  shocked to discover that his wife had been unfaithful to him  he has her executed  in his bitterness and grief he decides that all women are the same  thus  he begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning  before they have a chance to dishonor him  eventually the servant  whose duty is to provide the women gets down on his knees and says    my king we ve run out of virgins   to which the king replies    well that s not true  i believe that you have two daughters  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the servant begs the king for his mercy and says    my king  please don t do this to me  have you forgotten all the years of service i ve done for you   but to no avail  the king forces the servant to offer him the daughters </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the servant s daughters was very brave  so in a very game of thrones   khaleesi type of fashion  she says    don t worry father  i can handle this   on the night of their marriage  she begins to tell the king a tale  but does not end it  the king  curious about how the story ends  is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion  the next night  as soon as she finishes the tale  she begins  and only begins  a new one  and the king  eager to hear the conclusion  postpones her execution once again  so it goes on for       nights    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now neither i m not here to tell you that i m very clever like the daughter  nor am i here to give you tips on how to escape death  i m here to remind you of this moralistic parable  because it communicates a very powerful message  that a story can save a life thousands of times  the mba program was my chance to tell stories with the same niftiness as the girl did  some day  if i find myself at a low point of life  and feel that all the things in my life are frustrating and my luck is absolutely the worst amongst everyone   i can look back and remember my      nights in the program  here are some notes i took along the way </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on admissions  it was april       and when i opened my inbox that morning  i could feel my forehead wrinkle with psychological pain  the top message in my color coded mailbox was another rejection from my first choice of b schools     the message was long  and like most generic responses  was designed to deceive me into believing that the person on the other side actually empathized about my personal defeats  after reading it  i asked myself the question    i ll have to do this all over again next year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like most b school applicants  i had spent an incalculable number of hours crafting essays  convincing recommendation providers  taking atrocious tests     so on and so forth  and in that moment  the last thing i desired to do was to reiterate the process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with the same thought in mind  i spent the next weekend searching for schools that still had an application round open   which finally led me to the hec application page  atypical to other schools  hec featured a candidate profile page   which quintessentially worked as a pre assessment tool     considering there wasn t much time left  i decided to proceed directly with the full application instead    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the essays were for the most part similar to other applications i had already completed  so i proceeded in the same fashion most mba applicants do   i copied a draft of my previous essays for other b schools  and rearranged them to fit the hec essay boxes  it took less than the weekend to do my research    and to push that button which displayed    submit      the action mostly left me with a false sense of satisfaction    and fatigue liberation that many desire everyday  and of course  in the back of my head  i could hear a voice spit out banal platitudes such as    if you never apply  you never know  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as i write this essay    sixteen months later  i ve come to realize that sometimes  banal platitudes can have a life changing impact on what you become  and that it was merely a banal platitude that brought me a step closer to obtaining the second most expensive piece of paper of my life     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on arrivals  i arrived at the front doors of campus like everyone else  with just two bags full of personal belongings from canada      i proceeded with the check in process     and subsequently moved my belongings to the on campus residence located on the august grounds  it took just under an hour to get to campus from the paris airport  following which i rushed to get a few things     from the closest store that was conveniently     located a few steps away from the front doors     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first two weeks were engaging and analogous to a game of tennis  the only difference was that first you watched the pros play the sport  players being the faculty   and then the pros watched you play and enjoy the same sports in a mildly sadistic fashion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the opening ceremonies  or in b school parlance  kickoff presentations were educational and led me to infer that faculty members have somewhat of sense of humor     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the induction period also established grounds for one of the many axiomatic principles of life as a b school student   that  your schedule controls you  you don t control it   which turns out to be one of the cliches with some truth to it      i showed up everyday  at nine on the dot  for a schedule of puzzling but impressive activities  the agenda varied from coaching on professional speaking  mbti personality type identification      negotiation games      introductory math workshops  improv comedy     sessions  and meetings with career advisors to things that simulated team building      tagged along with all this   i got a plethora of b school jargon thrown at me   the phrases were so oxygen depriving that they only reminded me of the greetings that flight staff members usually give before a plan takes off     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the phrases included catchphrases such as   end to end gtm strategy frameworks  paradigm changes  global strategic transversal initiatives  cross platform synergies  or unicorns as i prefer to call them   batch mates     etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the end of the two weeks  i found myself tried on levels of extroversion and basic math  subsequent to which i got permission to take on the actual coursework      which mostly reminded of the statement bain made to batman    ahh yes  now you have permission to die  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the upside of having a defined schedule is that you don t have to do a lot of thinking  or prep for that matter  which leaves room for socializing and exploration of the inner self  some fellow blues     decided to set up a tradition of dressing up well on tuesdays   sort of an anti casual friday movement     </paragraph>

  <title>said business school alum s venture transforms how companies meet</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an mba alumnus from oxford university s said business school recently launched an innovative company that provides unique meeting spaces for businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>julian jost founded spacebase in early       which he describes as  the first global peer to peer marketplace for workshop and meeting spaces   the company is based in berlin and provides meeting locations in europe  as well as in cities such as tel aviv  cape town and hong kong </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>jost and his partner and friend jan hoffman keining are former strategic consultants  they observed a trend in the business world of companies investing valuable time and money conducting conventional meetings on their own premises or in conference spaces in hotels  they discovered that the average employee spends    hours a month in meetings  and in the united states  this added up to      billion in expenditures for companies </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we offer a new approach to traditional business meetings   jost said during a recent interview    spacebase enables companies to hold their meetings in unique spaces  such as an old theatre in amsterdam  an indoor farm in berlin or even a boxing ring in munich  which allows them to reinvigorate their staff and find new and unexpected solutions and ideas  plus our venues often offer a cheaper alternative to traditional spaces  such as hotel conference rooms  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jost and hoffman keining developed their business model based upon elements of the sharing economy   the idea that a venture can create collaboration between different stakeholders and offer a service that meets all of the competing demands of the stakeholders through simple but effective processes made complete sense to me   said jost </paragraph>

  <title>the consortium  promoting minorities in american business and business schools for    years</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fewer than   percent of the        mba students who graduate from top tier business schools are african american  native american or hispanic american  and according to a recent bloombergbusiness article   corporate recruiters consistently bemoan the lack of qualified candidates of color  and they re willing to pay a premium to nonwhite  and non asian  new hires   in fact  among american mba candidates  african americans and hispanics who accepted jobs by april      earned around        more per year than white and asian grads  bloombergbusiness reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the consortium for graduate study in management is working to increase the numbers of qualified minority businessmen and women  one individual at a time  the consortium believes the best way to increase representation of minority groups in american business and education is to provide additional opportunities for minorities to achieve an mba education </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the consortium was created in      as a non profit organization dedicated to helping african american men gain the business skills they needed to secure positions in american corporations  it started by connecting just    african american men with    corporate partners  by       the consortium quickly grew to include women  hispanic americans and native americans  from there it has continued to grow and help more and more individuals  to date  more than       of the country s best mba students have achieved their goals thanks in part to scholarships  new opportunities and the diverse network the consortium provides </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the consortium s goals is to save minority mba candidates time and money  when you become a consortium fellow  you ll have access to a community of representatives from    plus corporate partners     mba programs and more than       consortium alumni  as a fellow  you ll also have access to merit based  full tuition fellowships to some of the country s top mba programs  of those admitted to the consortium  approximately    percent are offered a scholarship  last year      fellowships covering full tuition and mandatory fees were awarded </paragraph>
    <paragraph>becoming a consortium fellow is simple  just as you apply for an mba program  you can apply to the consortium  selection is based on academic records and evidence of commitment to the consortium s mission of promoting the inclusion of african americans  hispanic americans and native americans in business  your community activism  professional involvement and life experience will be reviewed within an application essay and letter of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the key to becoming a fellow at the consortium is your commitment to change the perceptions of historically underrepresented groups  involvement with one or more of the following organizations helps to demonstrate this commitment and can strengthen your candidacy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are several advantages to consortium membership  for example  members can apply to up to six top u s  mba programs by completing a single application  that s right  instead of completing different applications for each individual school  as a consortium member you can complete a single application and apply to all six  you also pay a discounted fee to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition  consortium members have access to a variety of webinars and chats to help prospective mba candidates make the right decisions about their education  career and future  these events offer information on member schools and how to build a strong application  as well as more information on the consortium itself  the consortium admissions process opens annually on august   th  the first round deadline is october   th  and the second round deadline is january  th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each year  the consortium holds an annual orientation program   career forum  the forum gathers       mba prospects  university representatives  corporate partner representatives and alumni for an intensive five day conference of preparatory events  networking opportunities  job interviews and socializing  the forum the highlight of the year for students  alumni  schools and corporate partners offers a series of seminars and workshops delivering useful  real world career development advice directly to students from the best education institutions and corporations in the country </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not sure if the consortium is right for you  prospective mba applicants can check out the consortium blog to learn more about the program  full of detailed information about anything and everything that matters to the consortium  the blog is available to members and non members alike </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for mba students  alumni and corporations  the consortium offers an opportunity to increase diversity in mba programs and the workplace  according to a recent article in bloombergbusiness  consortium ceo peter aranda said that elite business schools are kidding themselves if they think they are doing all they can to promote diversity   they believe that the efforts that they are doing right now are giving them all of the candidates  who  exist   he told bloomberg   everyone s kind of stuck in the same place   the role of the consortium is to help people get unstuck </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there s still time to apply by the january          deadline </paragraph>

  <title>lbs alum explores the next frontier as part of international space mission</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a      graduate from london business school s emba program blasted off on december           as part of the international space mission </paragraph>
    <paragraph>colonel tim kopra is a nasa astronaut whose path to business school was somewhat rocky  in       he was training for an upcoming space mission when a biking accident thwarted his plans </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>with less than six weeks before his second trip to the international space station  he experienced a devastating fall during his usual sunday morning bike ride  nasa bans astronauts from high risk activities during their training  such as skiing  sky diving or motorcycle riding  but not bicycle riding  the fall broke kopra s hip  preventing him from continuing his training and from completing the mission </paragraph>
    <paragraph> frankly  because of the bicycle accident  i was afforded an opportunity to do something different   kopra said in a recent interview   i d been interested in going to business school for a very long time  i have a great job  and i d like to keep it for the time period i m scheduled to fly  but the school s global emba program really appealed to me  i thought it would give me a chance to identify what other opportunities are out there for astronauts if i chose to do something different  and also to learn a skill set that could be used both within and outside nasa  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>describing lessons learned during his emba that aided his success as an astronaut  he said   when you undertake case studies  what you re learning about is human behavior  decision making  leadership techniques  organizational structure and how to be more effective and more efficient  those are lessons that someone can carry to any job  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kopra and his fellow space explorers took off on december   th from kazakhstan  they will return to earth in june       video of the blast off is available here </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  forte mbalauncher shares her round   application experience</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>natalie neilson learned about the forte foundation s mbalaunch program a    week  hands on workshop for promising female applicants to business school in a somewhat backwards fashion  it all began with an interest in looking into business schools abroad  with the mba program at oxford university s said business school sparking her curiosity  after researching  she realized that oxford did not come to many events in dc  but she saw that the school would be participating in an upcoming forte forum  and so she went  at the forum  she saw people wearing name tags with a special ribbon that said  mbalauncher   so she asked to learn more  before long she would be wearing an mbalauncher ribbon herself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>neilson is something of a non traditional applicant to business school in part because she s looking to use the degree to transition out of consulting  the opposite of many would be mbas  the daughter of jamaican immigrants and someone who has also spent years working in restaurants  her dream is to eventually put her mba and prior consulting experience to work  specifically helping ethnic restaurants enhance their business operations by owning her own hospitality consultancy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we caught up with her recently  just after she submitted the last of her applications as part of round    in the interview that follows  you ll learn more about her application process  including what she found most enjoyable and what proved most challenging  you ll also get her uncensored views on the mbalaunch program  insight into other mba admissions preparation programs  she is also active in management leadership for tomorrow   and her take on the value of business school rankings  our thanks to neilson for taking time out of a busy schedule to share her story </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what industry are you targeting post mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>natalie neilson  my desire is to go into hospitality  and it s very non traditional compared to some of the more popular post mba routes like investment banking and consulting  so  with that in mind  i applied across the board for programs that had characteristics important to me  like academic rigor and cultural fit  i knew that from a professional standpoint  it was going to be largely up to me to network within the industry and get a job  no matter where i went to school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i am interested in the hospitality industry because i have been working in restaurants since i was a teenager  i went to college in dc and am now working in government consulting  before deciding to go get your mba  a lot of reflection should go into it  i decided to think about whether i wanted to come back to my company  or do something different  or even if there is something in between  there are always going to be aspects of every job that you ll like  and some that you don t  so i decided to see if there was an option out there that combined what i loved about consulting with the industry that i love  for example  i like working on a team and having that client consultant relationship  tackling issues  working on complex problems and turning them into solutions  variability of clients is a reason some people are drawn to consulting  but at this point in my career  i would like to be in a place where i can see the end result in house i am looking to make an impact where i am </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with that in mind  short term i want to pivot from consulting and work in internal strategy at a hospitality corporation  from my research with current students at different programs  marriott  starwood and hilton are great mba recruiting options in terms of getting that corporate hospitality experience  long term  i want to combine my restaurant experience  consulting skills and corporate hospitality work into launching my own consultancy specifically for restaurant owners of color </paragraph>
    <paragraph>restaurant success rates are pretty bad across the board  but if you have lived in any major city lately  you ll notice that ethnic restaurants tend to close first when anything changes  i m a believer in neighborhood culture  unfortunately  though  the restaurant consulting business isn t very diverse  i ve worked in all kinds of restaurants  and i want to help move the needle  ensuring that restaurants of all types are equipped to stay open and serve their communities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what schools did you apply to and what factored into your decision of where to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nn  since some decisions have yet to be released  i don t want to answer that question fully  i can say that i applied to all top programs remembering i m going for a non traditional mba industry  thus  my initial decision was to cast a wide net while researching  i talked to current students everywhere  learning all i could and asking a lot of questions to anyone who would be willing to offer their perspective  in my opinion  current students are the best source of knowledge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of choosing between schools to apply to i knew that it was going to be an uphill battle to obtain a job no matter what  given my target industry  i spoke to the hospitality club president at a few top schools  only to learn that two of them interned at the same company in the same department  they were literally co interns  in the field i am pursuing  no one is going to be like   you can t have this internship because you went to x top school vs y top school  just like working at a restaurant  it s about who you are  your work ethic and attitude and what you bring to the table   i didn t realize that was a pun until this moment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i did not choose schools because of rankings in fact  i am really anti ranking  i don t care which school is number one because the schools that were numbers one  two  three when i first started my research a couple years ago have changed a little bit  some people are gung ho about going to the    school  but it doesn t make sense to me to make a decision based on a number that can change  it s not lasting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>instead  i chose to think of something more solid  in my opinion  brand  now before you roll your eyes  credibility is big when you want to work with customers of all socioeconomic and educational levels  some people who own restaurants never went to college or even finished high school  sometimes we forget  in our pre mba bubbles  that people you bump into on the street don t know ranking  but they know brand  when i approach someone who didn t go to college to hire me in their restaurant  i want them to think i am credible when they hear where i got an mba  they are not going to be like   ok wait  let me check us news  you went to    and i only hire top     my dreams are very global and i want to know that no matter where i go or who i speak to  that person can understand my credentials </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what did you enjoy most about the application process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nn  it sounds weird  but i have enjoyed interviewing the most  as nerve wracking as it can be  i think i do better in person than i do on paper whether it s interviewing  talking to an admissions officer at the forte forums or speaking to current students on the phone  it s not just in terms of me being able to show my value but also in terms of learning what the value of the school is  sometimes the websites don t tell the whole story about the school  just as sometimes your application doesn t tell the whole story about you  no matter how much you try   plus  it s a great opportunity to gush about what you want to do sometimes people can pick that up in your eyes easier than they can in     words </paragraph>

  <title>choosing the best business school for consulting</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with round   decisions released for dozens of leading business schools  some applicants find themselves in the enviable position of having secured multiple acceptances  as successful applicant preston landers put it in our fridays from the frontline post last week   it s my turn to do the rejecting  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  with the hard work of applying behind them  round   applicants now face the equally important task of deciding which business school will best meet their needs  others are still gunning for round   deadlines no doubt trying to craft essays that reflect deep knowledge of individual school programs and how they dovetail with their personal career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to help in either endeavor  clear admit is launching a new series designed to drill down into the career placement statistics and other resources at individual schools on an industry by industry basis  we re kicking things off with a look first at some of the best business schools for consulting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>consulting continues to be a top draw for mbas unlike investment banking  which lost some of its allure for mba grads in the wake of the financial crisis  consulting has held its own as one of the most sought after industries to work in after business school  the      prospective student survey conducted by the graduate management admissions council  gmac  reveals that consulting topped the list of intended industries for both millennial and gen x respondents  with    and    percent respectively seeking jobs in either consulting services or management consulting upon graduation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>part of the allure of consulting is the diverse work  consultants get to think creatively and solve problems  analyze both the big picture and the details and work on teams juggling multiple assignments  top salaries don t hurt either  recent mba graduates taking jobs at firms like boston consulting group  bcg   bain   company  mckinsey   company and other consulting powerhouses reported starting base salaries of between          to           with additional signing bonuses of          according to managementconsulted com  an online resource for the consulting industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>choosing the best business school for consulting determining which leading business school will best prepare you for a career in consulting requires looking at a range of factors  including career outcomes at individual schools  both in terms of summer internships and full time jobs  if possible with the available data  you also want to get a sense of how well a school has done placing career switchers  namely those without prior consulting experience  in coveted consulting roles  since presumably barriers for entry are higher here than for counterparts who have already worked in the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it can also be instructive to see which of the powerhouse consulting firms donate to which leading business schools  finally  it helps to understand how a given school goes about teaching its students to be consultants  what role experiential learning places  whether you can hope to learn directly from superstar professors in the field and what extracurricular resources are in place to help you land your dream consulting gig </paragraph>

  <title>an in depth look at the forte foundation for women mbas</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to catalyst org  women make up only      percent of mbas earned in the united states  even worse  a landmark study by the university of michigan business school revealed that women make up less than    percent of corporate board members in america s     largest companies  the forte foundation is working to change those numbers  it s a non profit consortium dedicated to launching women into fulfilling  significant careers through access to business education  opportunities and a community of successful women leaders </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business is a great career destination for women  and in everything that we do  we are trying to highlight all of the amazing opportunities and options that women have in pursuing a business career and a business education getting their mba   says elissa sangster  executive director of forte   there s no end to the different options women have in a business career because there are so many different directions they can go from being an entrepreneur to being in banking  marketing or even non profit work  it is a great place to be  and it s also a very rewarding place to be  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a quick look at the forte foundation website demonstrates the organization s commitment to advancing businesswomen  forte has provided     million in fellowships to       mba women  thanks to its partnerships with more than    different mba programs  beyond fellowships  forte offers a wealth of information for members and for women mba candidates who are interested in learning more about getting into an mba program and making the most of their career </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are a variety of unique opportunities for women   the first general resource is to access the webinars available on getting an mba   says sangster   those answer the general questions about why to get an mba  what s important for your career path and where to look for help post mba  there are panels  presentations and interviews with experts  for mba candidates  there s plenty to read and plenty to watch to help give you a broad overview of an mba  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>however  the webinars are just a place to start   the forte forums series is an excellent opportunity to look at specific mba programs and how to get admitted   continues sangster   you ll hear from schools and from women who achieved their mba to discover why it was valuable for them and what they re doing now   she also recommends taking a look at the blogs and mba student profiles  women  members or not  can discover pertinent mba information  meet forte members and learn how to advance their career and mba application throughout the website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for more detailed help  forte offers the mbalaunch program discussed in detail on clearadmit   the mbalaunch program is a curriculum that helps women really fine tune their application  it helps them understand the true fit of a school so they can make a wise decision and prepares them for submitting their application   sangster shares   it goes through the interview process  taking the gmat and discusses all the things an mba candidate needs to think about  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>forte also  provides valuable resources for women looking for financial help for their mba  the forte fellows program was created to help spur female mba enrollment by offering fellowships for full time  part time and executive mba programs   the requirements to gain a forte fellowship vary between schools   says sangster   if you want to know if you have a chance  look at the class profile of the program you want  if your criteria are above average  then you re on the right track  they pick the top women in their applicant pool  the most important thing to do is to understand where you fit in that program s profile  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re looking for information about women who get their mba  what they look like and whether you could be one of them  sangster recommends reading some of the profiles on the forte website and understanding more about the forte fellows   our website contains fellow profiles that reveal where they were working before  where they went to school  what kind of extra curricular experiences they might have had and what they did in their spare time  it s a great way to understand more about what these women are doing  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the end of the day  it s the accomplishments of the forte foundation that speak to its benefits for members   this year  for the first time  we saw      percent of women enrolled in our forte schools it was    percent when i first started working at forte   says sangster   embedded within that number is the fact that    of our schools have enrolled more than    percent women  and    of those schools are above    percent in women s enrollment  our schools are very committed to heading toward    percent women enrollment  and the schools that are already at    percent have not taken their eye off the    percent mark  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>membership in the forte foundation is free   any woman is welcome to join the forte foundation   says sangster   so much of our content applies to any woman  no matter what career path she is in  there are a lot of leadership webinars  articles and messages of empowerment that they can access through forte  there is always something to learn  even if you re not interested in business  for businesswomen  the content and opportunities are very relevant  you can connect with companies  find job postings and attend programs just for the forte network  </paragraph>

  <title>who got in  who got waitlisted  who got dinged  livewire results for hbs and chicago booth</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit s mba livewire has been on fire these past two weeks with round   applicants sharing their triumph and defeat in the mba admissions process at top schools  with    schools releasing decisions this week wharton  darden  mit sloan  ross and tuck among them we expect record activity to continue  and we ll be keeping tabs on the decisions as they roll in  in the meantime  we re digging into some of the data shared last week  specifically with regard to how applicants fared at harvard business school  hbs  and the university of chicago booth school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first up  let s take a look at hbs  which released round   decisions on december  th  just as promised </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>reported gpas for those who were admitted to the class of      at hbs ranged from     to      with an average of       the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      for those waitlisted  the ranges and averages were much the same   the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of       those who didn t make the cut  meanwhile  had gpas between      and      average        and gmat scores between     and      average        those rejected from hbs were at least in good company representing    percent of livewire reports  acceptances accounted for    percent  and waitlisted applicants comprised the remaining    percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as was the case when interview invitations were extended for hbs  the main conclusion to be drawn is that you can t expect to get into hbs without really great stats  but great stats alone don t guarantee admission </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  we should note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who were accepted to hbs may be more likely to share the news publicly  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>greater percentage of acceptances at chicago booth a look at data for chicago booth  where decisions were also released on december  th  reveals similar patterns  here  reported gpas for applicants who were accepted ranged from      to      with an average of       gmat scores  meanwhile  fell between     and      with an average score of      for those who were placed on the waitlist  gpas ranged from      to       averaging       and gmat scores ranged from     to      with an average of      those who got a ding  meanwhile  had gpas between      and     and gmat scores between     and      with averages exactly the same as those accepted  gpa        gmat score       </paragraph>
    <paragraph> with chicago booth data  as with the data regarding hbs applicants  the sample size was small and selection bias may also be at play  not entirely surprisingly  livewire reports were far more positive for chicago booth applicants than for those who applied to hbs  those reporting acceptances at chicago booth represented    percent of total livewire submissions  compared to    percent waitlisted and    percent rejected </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thanks for sharing your results via clear admit s livewire  with hundreds more submissions coming in from applicants to schools releasing decisions this week  we re already at work parsing that data  so stay tuned </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  a successful round   applicant shares his tips on managing the process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week we are delighted to feature the following post from preston landers  a senior consultant for deloitte digital who has just completed the application process for business school  as you ll read  he applied to seven leading mba programs  got interviews at six and has now been admitted at three  he humbly calls himself an amateur  but we think the advice he offers is spot on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our thanks to landers  whose frequent posts on reddit s mba thread spurred us to ask him to contribute something here on clear admit  and a hearty congratulations for a job well done  we can t wait to see where he ends up in the fall </paragraph>
    <paragraph>go big or go home phew  time to exhale  i got into an mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i didn t make it easy for myself  i applied to seven schools in round    since i m from an overrepresented industry  tech consulting   i figured the more chances  the better  but that approach required that i execute all seven applications with the same attention to detail i d exert for just one app </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in this post  written on an airplane    i ll share six tips for applicants who are considering whether to  go big or go home  with five or more apps in a single round  i m no expert and i might have achieved success in spite of these efforts but i m satisfied with my results  all told  i interviewed at six of the seven schools  hbs  stanford gsb  wharton  kellogg  haas and tuck  and was ultimately admitted to wharton  tuck and kellogg s dual degree mmm program  which awards graduates with both an mba from kellogg and an ms in design innovation from the segal design institute at the mccormick school of engineering and applied science   here s my amateur advice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i m very fortunate to have multiple offers  and i ll spend the next month contemplating my decision  i ve really fallen in love with all three schools  but after receiving four rejections  it s my turn to do the rejecting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lastly  it s empowering to remember that the mba is a means and not an end  after all we ve accomplished  my fellow admits and i are ready to take on even bigger challenges  i m eager to get started  but maybe after a vacation or two  </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>the entire class of      divided up into    teams to tackle thorny issues confronting social media giant twitter as part of the  th annual integrative case competition at the samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management  four finalist teams battled it out for cash prizes and bragging rights on december  rd to close out the first semester of their first mba semester </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is the role of great institutions of higher learning to help great corporate institutions solve great problems   drew pascarella  faculty lead for the competition  said in a statement   you are challenged to assess  value and propose a tangible and actionable solution for one of the world s most talked about companies  twitter  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  students were tasked with examining twitter s lack of profitability  declining user engagement  soaring competition and ambiguous product focus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since its launch in       first years at johnson have competed as part this unique case competition as their first semester final project  the integrative case competition  which is sponsored by liberty mutual and corning  calls on them to combine the functional knowledge  decision making ability and leadership and presentation skills they ve honed since arriving at business school </paragraph>

  <title>how to know if an mba is right for you</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>at the most basic level  the question most mba candidates inevitably begin with is   why should i pursue an mba   a seemingly simple question  it is possibly the most significant one to consider on the path to a graduate degree  but much of the answer depends on weighing your individual pros versus cons and addressing common myths about an mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the first misconceptions on the road to an mba is about qualifications  many are convinced that only those with business related undergraduate degrees can get into a good school  others feel that their test scores  work experience or prior coursework would limit their appeal to admissions departments  in truth  any prospective student can be qualified with the right commitment and preparation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there is no such thing as an  ideal  mba candidate   says full time mba student jerrod dolenz   students represent a variety of professional backgrounds  personalities  countries and career ambitions  learning in that environment is part of the value of the degree  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dolenz is on track to graduate in      from georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  prior to business school  his professional experience spanned working as a paralegal and serving in the peace corps in africa  armed with an english degree  dolenz considered other graduate programs like law  international affairs and public administration  ultimately  he decided to pursue an mba because he found it more solution oriented than other degrees  arming him with versatile skills for the future </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the greatest benefit of an mba is the ability to hit the reset button on your career  it created an incredible number of opportunities   he explains   and i was drawn to mcdonough for its emphasis on collaborative problem solving  inclusive culture and a rigorous core curriculum  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>banking and consulting aren t the only paths similarly  full time mba candidate coral taylor successfully debunked a few myths on her way to enrolling at mcdonough  while many align business school with a career on wall street or in consulting  taylor intends to use her mba to make positive social change in the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i decided to get my mba because i share a fundamental belief that corporate america can and should be the greatest catalyst for change in society   says taylor   before my mba  i knew non profits could make a huge impact  but their challenges could impede their ability to serve  i wanted to learn how the public and private sectors can create and sustain models of social change  i also wanted to make a switch into the corporate sector and chose an mba to accomplish both of those goals  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>taylor spent her summer interning at starbucks  where she  learned that they didn t just throw money at social change it s embedded in their corporate strategy   she will begin her post mba career in the company s seattle headquarters as part of the category brand management team  other students are using their mbas to pursue careers in non profits  non governmental organizations  the federal or state government and international development </paragraph>
    <paragraph>versatility is a top selling point for an mba  thanks in part to a more diverse and well rounded student body  admissions committees like mcdonough s often take a holistic approach to reviewing applications  with an eye toward creating a widely varied class  this has two benefits  first  it allows applicants to prove themselves according to their academic ability  personal achievements and professional experiences  second  it results in an array of both full time and part time students from different backgrounds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on that note  dolenz admits he has  become much more effective working with diverse teams and more self aware of qualities that lead to effective leadership  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an mba s advantages extend beyond the classroom in addition to the coursework  business school also introduces networking and co curricular and other academic and professional opportunities that deliver a direct return on investment  in fact  for dolenz the mcdonough mba career center was key to his future position with deloitte s human capital practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the mba career center was instrumental in connecting me to and preparing me for my offer   he says   the center works closely with deloitte in hosting recruiting events  and i ve used its career coaches for advice  resume reviews and interview practice  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what s more  an mba delivers not just academic and professional knowledge  but the chance to improve on a personal level too  the transformation one goes through to obtain the degree helps to build confidence  executive presence and maturity in a way that few other experiences can offer </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you always should be out of your comfort zone   says taylor   being able to rise to a challenge or face something or someone intimidating is what makes us learn and become stronger  business school does that  it s the place to try and fail and to get better every time  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jerrod dolenz ft    hometown  iola  ks pre mba career  ifc  levy konigsberg llp  peace corps internship  international executive service corps student involvement  select   student government association vice president of community  mba volunteers president  net impact member  gala member  graduate student consulting group member why an mba   i researched many degree programs  law  mpa  international affairs  before choosing an mba and ultimately decided that i wanted a degree that would position me to solve problems for clients in the private and the public sectors  i have used my time in business school to strengthen my quantitative skills and hone my analytical approach to problem solving through strategy courses  i have also developed my leadership skills as a vice president of the student government association and in club leadership roles  </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>it s getting to be that time of the year  for the sake of being somewhat politically correct  it s the slightly chillier time of the year that s directly proportional to increased gift giving  if you work most   to   jobs  there s likely some type of end of calendar year celebration planned which can be make or break time in office social circles  you want to sit next to brad from marketing who is super dreamy and knows more about the walking dead and shark tank than the producers while avoiding mark from finance who can be heard a mile away because he jingles orange tic tacs in his shirt pocket  wait  is it marketing who is dreamy or is it brad  since when did finance grow legs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before you go running to the party planning committee  let s take a look at misplaced modifiers and how they can derail not only your holiday party  but your sentence correction experience on the gmat  modifiers diversify sentence structure and allow the writer to do more within a simple sentence  however  modifier errors create problems in meaning and are commonly tested on the gmat </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most common modifiers on the gmat are prepositional phrases  participial phrases  appositive phrases and relative clauses  prepositional phrases start with   you guessed it   a preposition such as from or on  common errors involved location in a sentence so instead of </paragraph>

  <title>u s  news short list takes a closer look at how many applications top business schools receive</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as round   applicants anxiously await word from their top choice mba programs  does it help or hurt to know just how many applications those programs receive each year  u s  news  best known in the mba space for its annual ranking of top business schools  this week devoted its separate short list in which it parses data collected as part of the rankings process to spotlight individual data points to overall application volume at leading schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perhaps not surprisingly  the schools that draw the greatest number of applicants also occupy most of the top spots in the u s  news rankings  specifically  in      the three schools that received the most applications were also ranked as the top three business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  received more applications than any other for the mba class that started in fall            and placed second in the overall rankings  stanford graduate school of business fell below hbs in terms of number of applicants       but placed first in the rankings   with an entering class half the size of hbs s  stanford is the most selective of all mba programs   third  both in the rankings and in terms of the number of applicants  was the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  with       applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>farther down the list  things got a little more interesting  for example  the fourth most popular business school in terms of application volume was columbia business school  receiving       applicants in       despite its  th place ranking overall   maybe its new york city location has a little something to do with the high number of applicants  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ucla s anderson school  ranked   th overall  was  th in terms of application volume  drawing       applicants in       that number was just shy of the  th ranked university of chicago booth of business  which drew       mba hopefuls last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the average number of applications received per school at the    schools with the most applicants in      was        so however you may fare as admissions decisions are doled out  you can take solace in knowing that you are in good company </paragraph>

  <title>online meets offline for today s consumer  notes wharton professor</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>david bell  professor of marketing at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania  recently presented research exploring the intersection between online and offline shopping during a talk at the university of delaware s alfred lerner college of business and economics </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bell is a specialist in consumer behavior  specifically how this behavior plays out online </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph> now people have a more sophisticated and nuanced view that says  online and offline are good for different things   said bell  addressing the complexities inherent in the modern consumer s shopping experience   maybe they re not substitutes   he continued   maybe they re complimentary in interesting ways   he described the recent trend in retail sales of showrooms  which give customers the opportunity to try items in person before placing an online delivery order  this allows buyers the tactile experience of the goods before purchasing them  in addition to giving brick and mortar businesses the advantage of foot traffic </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bell s research team presented the example of warby parker  the popular eyeglass company founded by wharton mbas that used the innovative approach of allowing online customers to try on items before deciding to purchase them  as a result of adding a showroom  the company observed a   percent increase in demand  overall sales grew due to increased brand awareness  though sales through the try on delivery method decreased  warby parker s overall efficiency increased due to the fact that the company sent   percent fewer pairs of sample glasses to customers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>describing a phenomenon coined  the neighborhood effect   bell pointed out the importance of customer referrals in the online offline model </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if you can get your existing customers to bring in more customers  that s going to be a really powerful lever of growth  by now having this additional channel  you ve made one of your other channels more efficient   bell noted </paragraph>

  <title>help a fellow applicant out via the clear admit interview archive</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba applicants are sometimes perceived as cutthroat competitors  willing to do anything to gain an advantage over their peers  at clear admit  we know that is simply not true  as part of our past work as consultants advising applicants directly and in our current role as a digital media company covering the mba space we have met many extraordinary prospective mba students who are more than willing to help a fellow applicant out  we think this bodes well for the mba classrooms they ll end up in where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued as well as for the future of business itself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today  we are inviting the current crop of prospective mba students to help a fellow applicant out by contributing to the clear admit interview archive  in case you are unfamiliar with our interview archive  it is a unique repository of more than       reports submitted by mba applicants after they have interviewed with one or more of their target top tier business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>easy to sort by school  the clear admit interview archive was developed with applicants  needs in mind  and the details shared in these reports from the types of questions to expect to what the applicant would do differently if he or she had it to do over provide invaluable information to other applicants anxiously preparing for their own interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  have you benefited from the clear admit interview archive  we know many of you are nodding  in fact  we ve actually had numerous applicants tell us that they credit their own acceptance to their top school in part to the insight they gained from the interview reports found there </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you ve been using the interview archive to prepare for your interviews  won t you please take a moment and repay the favor  because as you might imagine  the interview archive is only as good as the reports applicants submit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re not sure what to write  we ll make it easy for you  we ve learned that the most helpful and informative reports usually include the following information </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  you are welcome to share as much or as little as you like whatever information you may have found helpful yourself  the point is  please share  you owe it to your fellow applicants plus it will help you prepare for those collaborative mba classrooms you re hoping to enter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you waiting for  submit your interview report now </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  mit sloan student scrutinizes her mba balance sheet</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>is the high cost of an mba worth it  this question gets bandied around frequently  most often by skeptics on the sidelines who have never set foot in a business school classroom  this week in fridays from the frontline we are pleased to share a recent post from a current mit sloan mba student who gives us her take on whether the significant funds she s invested into her two years at sloan was money well spent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>erica zendell is a sloan mba who will graduate this spring and a self proclaimed  bargain hunter   she wants to feel like she s gotten value for her investment be it when she buys a piece of clothing or commits six figures and two years to business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the post that follows she admits that she s not immune to occasional buyer s remorse with regard to the mba  but on the whole  she s convinced that between the expanded opportunities open to her now that weren t at the beginning of her time at sloan and the manifold hard to measure intangibles  which  account for everything that s worth it about being in business school  she has faith that she s coming out on top </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our thanks to zendell for sharing her thoughts with the clear admit audience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from the mit sloan student blog  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the business school  balance sheet </paragraph>
    <paragraph>speaking as a mba with plans to enter the retail industry after graduation  i couldn t help but spend my thanksgiving break thinking deeply about shopping  i m a notorious bargain hunter and well before business school was constantly fascinated by why and how people buy what they buy  and by the manifold tactics retailers and brands use to turn closed minds into open wallets  if you ve done your job well as a consumer  be it on black friday or any given shopping day  you leave the store with some degree of confidence in what you ve bought  what it ll do for you  and the price you paid for it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i d argue shopping for business schools is much the same as any shopping experience  you reflect on the things you want from your mba experience and your post mba life and you seek the places you believe will give them to you  you learn as much as you can where you can by perusing websites  visiting campuses  sitting in on classes  looking at job placements  and talking to students and alumni  eventually you decide on the schools for which you ll risk the money  time  and energy to go from  prospective candidate  to  admitted student   once you ve gotten in  you undergo another round of research before deciding on the school that will have the privilege of transforming you from  admitted student  to   st year mba  and your bank account from  healthy  to  hemorrhaging  on account of the typical and atypical expenses of student life  tuition  paid  of course  impromptu trip to turkey  not taken  mba trip to the british virgin islands  to be determined </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sometimes  i experience buyer s remorse about doing my mba  i think   when you re paying for medical school  you re ultimately paying to become a doctor  when you re paying for law school  you re ultimately paying to become a lawyer  when i m paying for business school  what am i ultimately paying to become  for all the classes in accounting and financial analysis i ve taken here  how do i put this education on a balance sheet and assign a value to the mba  especially when many of the people in my prospective field don t have one  was this opportunity worth the opportunity cost  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s problematic being a bargain hunter and going to a business school that is particularly obsessed with numbers and data when there are so many parts of the mba experience that are near impossible to quantify  the teachers who irrevocably changed the way you see the world  the internship that broadened your lens of possibility and changed the course of your career as you knew it  the classmates who could be your cofounders tomorrow or ten years from now  the privilege of collaborating and making memories with diverse people from all over the world  all over the world  can you really put a price on something like this  especially when what people want and expect from their mba experience can vary so much from person to person </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if anyone can find the optimal price for the mba  it s someone at mit sloan  but i m not sure the value of an experience like this can be completely measured at least not in the same way that i can measure the value the snow boots i just bought to survive my next winter in boston </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but if my quantitative classes have taught me nothing else in business school  the reality of the situation is this </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  a wharton alum takes issue with fellow alum donald trump</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>presidential candidate donald trump has continued to grab headlines in the past week  most recently for his call for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on   his comments have drawn strong reactions  including from opponents such as philadelphia mayor michael nutter  who said in an address to the media tuesday   we have no place for that kind of ignorance and tolerance and lack of understanding of what our country is about  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>trump s supporters  too  have also been quite vocal  and his popularity in the polls continues  in a national telephone poll conducted december  th through   th by the new york times cbs news  seven in    voters likely to vote in the republican primary felt trump was well equipped to respond to the threat of terrorism  with four in    saying they were  very confident  in his response  in this category  trump led all other candidates  both democratic and republican </paragraph>
    <paragraph>trump  a      graduate of the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  has also drawn reactions from his fellow alums  nutter  wg      among them  this week in fridays from the frontlines  we re republishing an open letter about trump to wharton s dean and vice dean from victor lee  a      wharton mba graduate  in the letter  lee  who is a former co chair of the wharton mba ethics committee  takes issue with trump s statements  arguing that they violate the school s ethics code </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from the daily pennsylvanian  where it originally ran on december  th  with permission from its author  the views and opinions expressed are those of the author   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dear dean geoffrey garrett and vice dean howard kaufold </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in          i had the honor of serving as a co chair of the wharton mba ethics committee  i still remember vividly the standards to which we hold our students and community  to quote from the      mba resource guide  section  d   the wharton community is committed to an environment free from discrimination and harassment of any kind   our ethics code was created  to develop a sense of individual responsibility on the part of each member of the wharton community to participate actively in maintaining such standards  to foster an environment of honor and trust within the wharton community  and to engender respect for the ethical standards of the wharton graduate  fulfilling this mission is a collective responsibility of the members of the wharton community  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as an alumnus  i consider myself very much still part of the wharton community and am proud to have had the opportunity to study at our elite school  there is another alumnus who has proudly   and loudly   proclaimed his affiliation with wharton time and time again  donald trump  in efforts to suggest his intellectual prowess  mr  trump has repeatedly seized upon the prestige of the wharton brand  in doing so  however  he only reaffirms his obligation to uphold the ethical standards we expect from all members of the wharton community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mr  trump has prominently  and quite publicly  failed our community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he has repeatedly made a mockery of our ethics code and the values wharton holds dear  most recently and arguably most disturbingly  on dec     mr  trump called for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states    presumptively as a measure to inhibit terrorists from entering the united states  in this statement and others  mr  trump assigned malicious intent to a whole class of people  this is the very essence of discrimination  it is a violation of the wharton principle to  respect the individual rights of others  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mr  trump has forfeited his right to be a member of our wharton community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is not enough for wharton to stand silent in the face of such remarks by a former son of the school  how can we set an example for our current  future  and even former  students if we allow such statements to go unanswered with the requisite opprobrium </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i respectfully call upon both of you fine gentlemen  as leaders of our august school and protectors of the wharton brand  to lead the public disownment of donald trump as a member of the wharton family  we at wharton seek to raise ethical leaders  we cannot sit idly by but must proactively and publicly denounce mr  trump s statement and the philosophy that engenders his invective  it is our moral obligation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if we are to be a global leader  it is time for us   for wharton   to send a clear message to the world  enough is enough </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with respect and concern </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>to encourage members of the uc berkeley haas school of business community to take part in a campus wide online fundraiser last month  the school s dean broke into song  a music video of haas dean rich lyons playing guitar and singing  i m  going to haasland  to the tune of paul simon s  graceland  helped haas raise a record          as part of the uc berkeley wide      big give on november   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the big give is a    hour  campus wide online fundraiser now in its second year  in which different schools on the uc berkeley campus engage in friendly rivalry in an effort to best one another in terms of how much money they can drum up for their own schools  with     gifts in all  haas donors this year topped last year s total of          and came in second overall among all schools and departments  just behind the college of engineering  haas got an additional         in extra  big slice  funds for its second place finish  in all  the big give elicited       gifts totaling      million </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are so thankful for the tremendous support and enthusiasm we received from all of our generous donors this year   michelle mcclellan  assistant dean of berkeley haas development   alumni relations  said in a statement   the entire berkeley haas community came together to support programs  students and faculty  making this year s event even better than the last  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the theme of this year s fundraiser was  think bigger   and individual donors took to social media to post photos of themselves topped by thought bubbles filled in with their perspectives on how berkeley reaches beyond itself </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in his youtube music video  lyons starts out at his desk  with thought bubbles of his own over his head  musing about how he can inspire others to think bigger  dream bigger and imagine bigger  he then picks up his guitar and begins to strum  stroll and sing tailored lyrics extolling the school s nobel laureautes  acknowledging  self deprecatingly  that he doesn t have one yet   four founding principles and the talent and achievements of its alumnae </paragraph>
    <paragraph> when you give to the haas fund  it s like a window on your heart   he croons   everyone sees you ve done your part  everybody feels the spirit grow  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you haven t checked out the video  it s worth the three minute investment to get a better sense of the person at the helm of the haas school  but be forewarned  you re likely to wind up with the chorus  haasland  haasland  right here in  ole berkeley  we re going to haasland  stuck in your head </paragraph>

    <paragraph>peek weekend debuted in      as an all female affair  with     promising young women drawn from    women s colleges including barnard  wellesley  mills and mt  holyoke  response surprised organizers  who originally planned to target just a single school  barnard  and draw around    or so participants  leopold said  the purpose of the program was to offer current students from women s colleges a  peek  into what the harvard mba program is like in part to help drive greater female enrollment   hbs this year welcomed    percent women as part of its incoming class  up from    percent in      and    percent in       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an interview with clear admit just after the all women s weekend  leopold was thrilled with how successful it had been and intimated that the format could be expanded to include other groups of potential hbs applicants  now  in just its second year  the school appears to be doing just that </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the      peek weekend will again be open to applicants from women s colleges  but it will also include two additional cohorts  one made up of stem majors and another made up of students who come from a family owned business background  each cohort will have its own specific curriculum  but the entire group will come together as part of joint sessions for all peek participants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an introduction to the hbs case method last year  a big part of the peek weekend focus was on introducing participants to hbs s signature case method  leopold was reluctant to talk about the event before it took place  unsure of how successful it would prove   we just didn t know   she said   can we get the case method to really cook  really bubble in such a short time with people who haven t done it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pilot group of women dove right in  embracing the case method with ease   i was blown away by how engaged and thoughtful they were   said frances x  frei  hbs professor of service management and senior associate dean for faculty planning and recruiting  who taught a case on tessei  a company that provides cleaning services for japan s bullet trains </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i immediately fell in love with the case method it was a huge part of the great experience i had there   said catherine cousins  who was a rising senior at mills college in california when she took part   i just assumed  based on my economics background that it would be really quant heavy  i was expecting numbers and statistics and excel  but the case method was so much more than just how the numbers change   she said </paragraph>

  <title>ucla anderson mba alum wants to help de clutter your life</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ucla anderson school of management mba program grad brian thomas was still a student when he raised the money to start his business  clutter  a self storage company that offers a mobile app and customized packing and delivery services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thomas has described clutter to be  as convenient as pizza delivery   thomas and his partner ari mir recently raised    million in order to take the company from a local venture to a nationwide business  as noted in a recent wall street journal article </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>clutter is unique when compared to other self storage companies  in that it sublets space in existing industrial buildings as opposed to building its own spaces  not only is this a sensible business strategy  but it s also a sustainable solution in terms of eliminating sprawl and building waste  another element of clutter s business model that differentiates it from similar services is the offering of an online visual inventory of one s items  which promotes ease of retrieval should one decide to have an item delivered </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thomas noted   i wanted a visual inventory of everything i had in storage and an easy way to have my things delivered to me i want to help people be smarter about storage by making it easy to access and enjoy their things  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clutter recently offered a special to ucla students and plans to do so again as it expands into a larger nationwide area  the company offers plans for as low as       a month for a small number of items and      per month for a garage sized space </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  kellogg first year reflects on the talent of her classmates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as those of us here in the united states attempt to work off hearty thanksgiving meals  some are still reflecting on the things for which we re thankful  in that spirit  our fridays from the frontline post today comes from nikita sunilkumar  a first year mba student at northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sunilkumar  a california native who worked as a production engineer at boeing before business school  entered kellogg as part of a record breaking class made up of    percent women  as she shares here  she took part in an eye opening exercise as part of the school s women s business association led by kellogg professor victoria medvec  one designed to help participants recognize and appreciate the remarkable talent of their classmates  our thanks to sunilkumar for sharing her thoughts and for business schools across the globe working toward gender parity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post was republished in its entirety from the inside perspective  kellogg s full time mba student blog   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s a statistic that has floated around since orientation and pre term  but i think it bears repeating  the kellogg class of      has a record percentage of female students  and at    percent of an incoming class of      those students are poised to make a big impact  i had a chance to feel this impact quite viscerally when i walked into the allen center a few weeks ago for the first annual women s welcome event hosted by the women s business association  wba  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all the spectacular diversity among my classmates was on full display  bright voices and smiles filled the room as greetings were exchanged between old friends and new  introductions were made among those from vastly different professional and personal backgrounds in a cacophony of accents and languages  and the somber black suits of a stereotypical business meeting were replaced with a riot of color and style </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i would have been hard pressed to find any one characteristic to fully define the group around me  at least until professor victoria medvec stood up to lead us in an exercise  she noted that women often don t voice their own accomplishments in business settings as often as men do  and challenged each of us to introduce ourselves to the student seated alongside us by emphasizing our unique strengths </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prof  medvec reconvened the group and asked students to highlight their neighbors and share these accomplishments with the whole room  as each student spoke up  it became clear we were all united by a common theme  talent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among our ranks we have highly accomplished managers  consultants  bankers  scientists  veterans and other professionals  and each person at that first wba meeting is someone i can t wait to get to know better over the next two years  certainly part of my motivation is wanting to build a strong professional network among my peers  but i m mostly excited about being around the kind of people i met at the allen center that day  friendly  enthusiastic and generous about sharing their successes while promoting and supporting each other </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the weeks have passed i am happy to say that my initial impressions have only deepened  the kellogg culture is truly  high impact and low ego   as promised </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each new conversation reveals something interesting or admirable about a classmate or a faculty member  questions for information are never ignored and offers to share more are always forthcoming  there is no shortage of inspiration  from second years and the many projects they have undertaken within and outside the kellogg community  to the faculty and administration  who clearly share a high regard for each other as well as the work that they do </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the days pass  i find that i hardly notice how many amazing women are part of the kellogg community  and i m impressed by that most of all  when so many business and institutions struggle with creating a culture of inclusion  the fact that it seems so effortless at kellogg is both uplifting and inspiring  i look forward to doing my part in keeping this particular kellogg  tradition  alive and well for future students </paragraph>

  <title>livewire data offers insight into mit sloan  stanford gsb interview invitations</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in recent weeks  clear admit s mba livewire has continued to be on fire with submissions from applicants making their way through the round   application process at top schools  we ve received reports regarding a great many schools including columbia business school  oxford s said business school  nyu stern and cornell s johnson school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for today  though  our data analysis will focus on mit sloan and stanford graduate school of business  gsb   whose interview invitations and rejections have given scores of livewire participants cause for elation or despair </paragraph>
    <paragraph>livewire action began to intensify for mit sloan late last month  so let s take a look first at those results </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those who were invited to interview  reported gpa ranged from an outlying      to      with an average of       the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      notably  the ranges and averages were much the same for those who got a ding   the gpa range was also similar       to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of       roughly    percent of those who reported their mit sloan fates via livewire got a ding  with the other    percent happily sharing that they d been invited to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as with our analysis of hbs and chicago booth livewire data a few weeks back  conclusions to be drawn here are basically that almost everyone has great stats  so it is more than simply a stellar gpa or gmat score that gets someone an interview invitation  notably  mit sloan did seem willing to interview a few candidates whose gpa or gmat fell outside of the top cluster  presumably because other components of their application were particularly compelling </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here again  we need to note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who scored well on the gmat or had strong gpas may be more inclined to share their numbers publicly  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>moving on to stanford reveals similar patterns  here  reported gpas for applicants who have received an invitation to interview ranged from      to       with an average of       gmat scores  meanwhile  fell between     and      with an average score of      for those who got dinged  gpas ranged from      to       averaging       and gmat scores ranged from     to      with an average of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with stanford gsb data  as with the data regarding mit sloan applicants  the sample size was small and selection bias may also be at play  interestingly  though  with stanford  reports of rejections made to livewire dwarfed reports of interview invites  four out of five applicants who reported their fates via livewire got a ding from stanford </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as you make your way through your interviews for those of you who fell into that desirable camp be sure to keep us posted on how it goes  if you re still prepping  don t forget clear admit s interviews guides for mit sloan and stanford  which can help you prepare  thanks for sharing your results via clear admit s livewire  keep  em coming </paragraph>

  <title>new england patriots owner robert kraft pledges     million to hbs to advance precision medicine</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the robert and myra kraft family foundation  inc  has pledged     million to create a new endowment at harvard business school  hbs  to advance precision medicine  the school announced yesterday  foundation president robert k  kraft  a      hbs mba graduate and current owner of the new england patriots nfl team  was in attendance at the partners precision medicine conference wednesday at harvard medical school  where the announcement was made  the pledge comes as part of harvard university s      billion capital campaign </paragraph>
    <paragraph>using business to narrow the gap between scientific discoveries and medical solutions the kraft endowment for advancing precision medicine will support research and other activities to advance the field of precision medicine  a growing movement in patient care allowing scientists and physicians to use genomic information to understand a disease based on its biological mechanisms  using the human genome in this way could allow for more precise diagnoses and more tailored treatments of serious diseases </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gaps between scientific discoveries and the development and commercialization of medical solutions to help the public has slowed growth in the industry  as have rising costs of clinical trials and too little collaboration between scientists  the pharmaceutical industry and investors  hbs  in partnership with precision medicine pioneer the broad institute  hopes the new kraft endowment will contribute not only to accelerating advancements in precision medicine but also to fast tracking commercialization of these solutions to help them reach those who need them most </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a personal pledge</paragraph>
    <paragraph>kraft s pledge to his alma mater  where several of his sons also studied  is a very personal investment  his wife  myra kraft  died of ovarian cancer in       during her illness  the kraft family came to understand the promise of precision medicine through frequent consultation with broad institute director dr  eric s  lander  a professor at both mit and harvard medical school and a former member of the hbs faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the kraft family has long been a standard bearer in boston s business and philanthropic communities   harvard university president drew gilpin faust said in a statement   this extraordinary gift continues that tradition in a way that will have a huge impact on generations to come  contributing to the quality of life for many people around the globe by alleviating the pain and suffering caused by a wide array of serious illnesses  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>precision medicine advancement faces business challenges that the kraft pledge goes to hbs  rather than to harvard medical school  is about more than just school loyalty   at heart  many of the challenges facing the advancement of precision medicine today are business challenges   hbs dean nitin nohria said in a statement  he added that he is honored that the krafts  see the potential for hbs to work with world class organizations like the broad to develop innovative and integrative new models from organizational structures to collaborative data centers that will position boston at the epicenter of this arena in the future  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>already  two pilot research projects designed to accelerate the discovery and trials process are set to begin in coming months  the first  a precision trials challenge  will challenge the medical and scientific community to use precision medicine techniques to find ways to cut the cost and time required to execute clinical trials  the second pilot will use crowdsourcing contests to try to break through data bottlenecks to solve and scale precision medicine solutions for both clinical and commercial use </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many future activities are also being developed to help address challenges and seize opportunities in precision medicine  a few of them </paragraph>

  <title>the big decision  choosing an evening mba program</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as decision time neared for her mba enrollment  anjali shahani was leaning toward the mba evening program at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  she was originally pursuing a part time program to retain her position at the highly coveted world bank group  like any good researcher  she attended information sessions and joined various club events all of which provided her new insights that shifted her plan </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i m generally passionate about what i do and active in my community   says shahani   i decided if i was going to be a part of georgetown  i wanted to be an active member  participating in extracurricular activities although not impossible is definitely more challenging when you are combining studies and a full time job  i realized i would not be able to fully commit to both  plus maintain the balance i wanted in my personal life  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that epiphany led shahani to enroll in georgetown s full time mba program a decision she feels was best for her professional and personal goals  she will graduate as part of the mcdonough full time mba class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her story exemplifies how important both school research and a dose of soul searching can be in identifying the right mba program for you  for many  simply deciding to pursue an mba is a triumph  followed by a careful process of narrowing down a list of multiple schools to the one that fits you best </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but even after you have selected a school  choosing between full time or part time studies can be one of the biggest decisions mba candidates make </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i took my time   says leslie ogden  a member of mcdonough s evening program class of        i fully researched both programs and carefully considered what i want my career to look like and where my passion lies  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after applying and being admitted to a full time program at another top ranked u s  business school  ogden opted for mcdonough s mba evening program  which is now ranked fourth by bloomberg businessweek  studying part time would enable her to keep a full time job as an assistant vice president at her political advocacy organization where she has experienced strong professional growth and personal fulfillment something she decided was vital to her </paragraph>
    <paragraph>matt mcelhare made a similar discovery in his own mba considerations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the idea that the evening program allows additional time as a three year program instead of two was very appealing   said mcelhare  a member of the class of        the extra three years of work experience  obtained while completing the degree  has allowed me to apply what i m learning in real time and to continue to grow  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like others in his cohort  mcelhare found that both programs offered the same quality education and the opportunity to still consult for an international company through the global business experience something that is rare among part time mba programs  plus  the opportunity to retain his job at jacobs engineering group also significantly reduced the opportunity cost associated with obtaining his degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the evening program curriculum mirrors the full time curriculum  and the program office does a great job of making sure that the same incredible professors teach modules in the daytime and in the evening  the evening program also has the same access to the mba career center   he says   but for me  maintaining an income throughout the program tilted the scale in favor of the evening program  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how best to strike a balance between working toward an mba and continuing to progress in your career can differ from candidate to candidate  but most agree that mcdonough s location played a huge role in their decision making  the intersection of business and policy in washington  d c  and in particular at georgetown mcdonough was a big factor for many </paragraph>
    <paragraph> not only does my professional network continue to grow every day by virtue of living and working in d c    says ogden   but just by being in this program and going to class  i m meeting incredibly talented individuals who i otherwise would not have had the opportunity to know  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the school s mba career center  top global companies host on campus events  often thanks to the strong network of         georgetown university alumni  in addition to lectures  roundtable discussions and networking receptions  student leaders also coordinate career days that offer students a sample  day in the life  for different industries  and then there are career treks to various employers either in the nation s capital or to sites in global hubs like new york  san francisco  london and hong kong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective students mulling over a full time versus a part time or evening mba program also are wise to factor in their own on campus ambitions  many know before they even apply that they will join student government and other extra curricular clubs or teams  while others find unexpected opportunities along the way  mcelhare  evening student government association  esga  vice president  said that esga has created resources to allow evening students to dial in via a conference call to mid day mba club meetings so that evening students can participate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at mcdonough  that may include any of more than    student run cultural  interest based  service  recreational and student government organizations from the georgetown mba entrepreneurship club or women in business to the outdoors club or georgetown wine society </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for shahani  the final decision to go the full time route was based on logic that evening program candidates can appreciate  too  being able take advantage of all that georgetown has to offer  but above all  gaining a quality education </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my classes  although very challenging  are also entertaining and fun  i visited other universities  but i only applied to georgetown   she says   it was my first and only choice  and i was very lucky to be accepted  </paragraph>

  <title>bloomberg businessweek rankings data reveal high cost of mba networking</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>while most who are contemplating an mba at a leading business school are well aware of the steep costs of tuition and foregone earnings  the budget line item for  extras  is sometimes overlooked  bloomberg businessweek  as part of its annual ranking of full time mba programs  asked students from the class of      just what they spend on nonessential items  the findings  the more prestigious the school  the higher the cost of networking </paragraph>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs   which was number one in bloomberg bw s most recent overall rankings  also topped the charts in terms of students  median expenditure on nonessential items  at         </paragraph>
    <paragraph>median spend on extras by students at stanford graduate school of business was second highest  also north of          the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and columbia business school weren t far behind  at more than         each </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg bw notes that it shifted this year from reporting average expenditure to median spend at each school  in part to  smooth out outliers  like that one charge card happy student who goes on every school trip   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>trips certainly account for a large share of the nonessential spending mba students go in for  from the field global immersion requirement for all hbs first year students to nyu stern s entertainment media and technology association  emta  trek to silicon valley  it s hard to find a leading business school today where group trips across the country or around the globe aren t an integral part of the curriculum or the job search or both  there are also lots of non academic travel opportunities as well  such as kellogg worldwide experience   service trips  kwest   which bring kellogg mbas together for social  sight seeing and community service expeditions to places ranging from malaysia to chile to turkey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>professional clubs  too  which include annual membership fees  ticketed events and more  can also put a dent in business school students  bank accounts  of course  there are the arguably more frivolous club related expenses as well  such as wine tasting with the chicago booth wine club or ski passes as part of membership in mit sloan s ski and snowboarding club </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but whether as part of a class related consulting project in india  a job scouting trek to visit cpg firms in chicago or an expensive dinner at per se with cbs s gourmet club  the network building opportunities common to all of these activities can be a valuable part of the overall business school experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  prospective mba applicants targeting leading schools would do well to budget for expenses beyond tuition and fees  still  there are ways to take part in valuable mba networking opportunities without splurging at every turn </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cbs student victor eng secured his summer internship through a relationship forged with a ceo who came to one of this classes to speak   there are lots of ways money isn t a limiting factor in business school   he told bloomberg bw   you just have to be more strategic than others about what you say yes to  </paragraph>

  <title>veterans at mit sloan on how their service prepared them for business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>what does a navy fast attack submarine officer who spent months at a time at the bottom of the ocean have to contribute to class conversation at an elite business school  plenty  it turns out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brian kirk      graduated from penn state with a degree in mechanical engineering before attending officer training school in rhode island to earn his commission in the u s  navy  after a year and half in the navy s nuclear training pipeline  he served on board the uss louisville as part of a western pacific deployment and in its home port of pearl harbor  there was not a single gmat prep course in his path  and yet  today  he is a member of the mba class of      at mit sloan school of management where he fits right in </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several factors led kirk to service in the navy   it was something i felt compelled to do   he says   i felt like i needed to serve in some regard to support this country and the constitution that i believed in so much   but he also wanted to see the world  and there was a degree of sexiness and bravado that appealed to him  too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so how did he get from there to mit sloan  the military life wasn t right for his family for the long term  he says   my wife is incredibly intelligent and definitely deserves a rewarding career of her own  which was not likely to happen if i were to stay in the military   he knew he could lead he d been in charge of     people when he was driving the ship but he needed to  bridge the gap to reality   he says   an mba called to me as a way to learn the hard business skills i would need to go out and run an organization or be my own boss one day  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he and his wife set to work applying to school business schools for him and physical therapy programs for her hoping to both get into top programs in the same city  it came down to a decision between boston and chicago and between mba programs at sloan and northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to hear him tell it  he settled on sloan somewhat reluctantly   it was at the bottom of my list and i chose it just for the convenience of being in the same town as my wife and being high in the rankings   he confesses  with apologies to the admissions office   submariners are notoriously geeky  somewhat introverted  odd personalities   he says   we don t see the sun very much   he adds with a laugh </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for business school  he wanted something different  he wanted to be around outspoken  outgoing people and be forced to use the other side of his brain  surely  sloan wasn t this place  or so he thought </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the first time i got here for admit weekend i could tell that everything i thought about mit as being a tech house was wrong   he says  instead of a bunch of geeky introverts  he found a community of outgoing  extroverted high achievers that enjoys being around each other and learning from each other   in the end it all just landed perfectly i wound up in exactly the place i was supposed to be and that was just sheer good luck  </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  conquering fomo at insead</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>watching livewire  we ve seen lots of insead interview action in the past few weeks  including this disappointed but determined post from an india applicant in malta who didn t get an invitation   spent all of summer in pursuit of insead   he or she wrote   heartbroken but not fallen yet    cue a collective  aww  in the clear admit office  keep calm and stay positive </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in today s fridays from the frontline  we hear from someone who did make the cut at insead only to arrive on campus and confront a challenge of a whole new sort  fomo  or fear of missing out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are just so many amazing and fascinating events and activities taking place all the time as part of insead s warp speed     month mba program that it can be hard not to fixate on what you re missing out on in any given moment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>victor lamm found himself in just that position when he began his mba program at insead this past fall  suspecting that others might be wrestling with similar struggles  he wrote a funny and insightful blog post for the  insead mba experience  student blog  which he s graciously allowed us to repost here for clear admit readers to enjoy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a division i tennis player in college  lamm earned an ms in sports business from new york university  coaching the men s tennis team in the process   he also has worked in communications for several leading sports organizations  including the french tennis federation  the alltech fei world equestrian games and the lagard re paris racing  a prestigious european tennis club  at insead  he is studying marketing  strategy  entrepreneurship and management with the goal of becoming a leader in tomorrow s sports industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>read on to learn some of the strategies he s developed to combat fomo  which while perhaps even more pronounced at insead and other one year mba programs  can be a common phenomenon at any business school given the frenetic pace and unfathomably limitless number of opportunities that confront mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  the insead mba experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we ve learned many colloquialisms since we stepped foot on the insead campus  breakout rooms  dash  splash  renaissance  lunch roulette  fonty  but one word seems to stand out though  fomo a k a  fear of missing out  there s no cure for it  but here are a few ways we can try to avoid it  or at least suffer less from it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   accept that we cannot do everything</paragraph>
    <paragraph>no matter how well we allocate our time  we will not be able to do everything  what s the solution then  well it s actually very simple  realize and accept that we just cannot do everything we want in a given day </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there s just simply not enough time to do it all  last time i checked  there was    hours in a day  if we account six hours of class on average  seven to eight hours to sleep     minutes to brush our teeth  do not save time on this      minutes to shower  same as the toothbrush      minutes of commuting    hours to eat  we have only around   or   hours for professional clubs  company presentations  leisure time  and social stuff  that s not that much </paragraph>
    <paragraph>which makes me move to my next point  we all have to prioritize at some point </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   prioritize</paragraph>
    <paragraph>i heard that we could be hunters or explorers  lions or gazelles  no matter who we are  what we do  we won t be able to do it all anyway  so what do we have to do  prioritize  when we feel rushed and pressured to do it all  let s take a step back and remind ourselves why we came to insead in the first place </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maybe it s     have fun     get better at ping pong     find a job  i m not sure if these are the right priorities  but maybe it s really yours  it s not quite mine  i would put ping pong first   but i respect it because there s no right or wrong answer to that question  the most important thing is to be clear on what we want  and to make choices according to those priorities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s just like the everest assignment  to reach the everest  we couldn t let the photographer take his stupid pictures at levels one and two  we have to see the big picture and make compromises to reach the top </paragraph>

  <title>new forte data shows impressive gains in female mba enrollment</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>women make up at least    percent of the mba class at    leading u s  business schools this year  compared to just five last year  according to new data released today by the forte foundation  a nonprofit consortium of business schools and companies working to increase opportunities for women in business </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in       less than a third of mba students were women  today we re inching closer to    percent in the united states and working to close the gap significantly in another five years   says forte executive director elissa sangster   every percentage point gain is not only hard earned  but something to celebrate  and should go a long way in building the senior leadership pipeline at companies and on boards   she continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the u s  schools leading the charge to increase female mba enrollment are dartmouth s tuck school of business  harvard business school  mit sloan school of management  northwestern s kellogg school of management  uc berkeley s haas school of business  the university of chicago booth school  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and the yale school of management  all of which topped    percent this year  sixteen forte u s  member schools this year have at least    percent female enrollment  up from just three a decade ago </paragraph>
    <paragraph> forte was launched in      to address the then stark underrepresentation of women in top business schools as compared to medical or law schools  today  it has grown to    member schools in the united states  canada and europe and spearheads multiple initiatives aimed at closing the gender gap as it relates to pursuing an mba and careers in business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the organization s many initiatives is the forte fellows program  through which exceptional female mba students are awarded scholarships by participating member schools to offset the cost of business school  these scholarships have grown from    in      to more than     for the incoming class of       totaling more than     million in aid to date </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it also hosts two annual conferences  the forte mba women s leadership conference  which draws together hundreds of women mbas and top companies  and the forte college to business leadership conference  designed to introduce undergraduate freshmen and sophomore women to business related summer internships and entry level jobs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sangster credits the forte forums  one of the organization s longest running programs  for perhaps having the greatest impact on helping increase female mba enrollment  these free events  held each fall in cities across the united states  canada and the united kingdom  introduce talented young women to business school representatives  mba alumnae and one another to raise awareness of the mba degree and what it offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we have had such amazing support from our business school partners in promoting it and hitting up their alumni ranks to share their inspirational stories   she tells clear admit   it s clear when women are leaving these forums that they have had a life changing event  not only because of the people they have gotten to meet but also because they have realized they are not alone that there are so many other women out there just like them   she says  every year forte reaches between five and six thousand women about the mba through its marketing around these events   that has pretty strong implications for changing the tide  and we are seeing increases in audience every year we have done them   she says </paragraph>

  <title>gmac launches new tuition assistance tool to help mba applicants research financial aid</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the graduate management admission council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmat entrance exam for business school admissions  has launched a new interactive tool designed to help prospective mba applicants better understand the types of financial aid and tuition assistance offered by business schools in different regions of the world  gmac designed the tool using survey data collected from    business schools as part of its      application trends survey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective gmat test takers worldwide cite the challenges of financing the mba as by far the greatest obstacles to pursuing the degree  according to gmac s      prospective students survey report  nearly half     percent  cite the fact that a graduate business degree requires more money than is available as a major reservation  and    percent say the same about the prospect of incurring large financial debt as part of obtaining the degree   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in response  gmac created this new tool  which allows prospective applicants to indicate the region and type of business school program they are interested in and then serves up a bar chart reflecting what percentage of those programs offer various types of tuition assistance </paragraph>
    <paragraph> defined broadly  tuition assistance programs include any kind of initiative undertaken by a graduate business school to help students cover the cost of tuition   gmac notes  in response to the survey  business schools reported offering a full spectrum of programs  including merit  and need based scholarships  fellowships and stipends  and work study and assistantship opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>globally     percent of the business school programs surveyed offer some form of merit based scholarships  narrow your search terms more  and the results shift  for example  a greater percentage of u s  two year mba programs    percent offer merit based aid  but among online mba programs surveyed  only    percent do </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in addition to one  and two year mba programs  the tool also parses survey data for a range of specialized masters programs  including masters of management  finance  accounting  supply chain management  marketing and data analytics  global data is also available for part time  flexible and executive mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the tool provides just a very basic starting point for the investigation of financial aid options for the mba   reach out to the schools you re interested in and ask them about what kind of assistance is available to you   gmac advises  but having this insight into the relative distribution of different types of tuition assistance could help prospective applicants decide where and what types of programs make the most sense for them  it also gives applicants an understanding of the full landscape of tuition assistance available  better equipping them to plan how to pay for school and to fully explore all available options as part of the application process </paragraph>

    <paragraph>here s what we know from past admissions cycles at wharton  historically  wharton has typically interviewed roughly    percent of applicants to the mba program  though this does vary depending on application volume  selectivity has generally fallen between    percent and    percent in recent years  which suggests that you can assume a roughly one in three chance of admission if invited for an interview  of course  these are all based on past application seasons  and wharton could change things up at any point </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the written interview invitation  wharton has sometimes asked some applicants to improve their test scores and quantitative skills  if you receive such a request  we strongly recommend that you take the necessary steps  such as signing up for a course or registering to retake the gmat  to address that feedback before your interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as wharton hopefuls no doubt know  the school s interview consists of a team based discussion  tbd   followed by a brief one on one meeting with an admissions representative  read more about the tbd and how to prepare here  you can also gain some insight on the tbd from our admissions director q a with wharton s frank devecchis </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton offers round   interviewers the option of interviewing on campus in philadelphia or in a range of major cities around the world  off campus interviews will take place this year in beijing  dubai  london  mumbai  san francisco  sao paulo  seoul  singapore and tokyo   we encourage all invited candidates to interview in the location that is most convenient for you whether in philly or one of our off campus locations   reads the wharton website </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  mba mama on pitching as a female entrepreneur</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week in our fridays from the frontline series  we are delighted to have as our contributor divinity matovu  a first year mba student at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  matovu  whose focus at wharton is on entrepreneurial management and finance  also happens to be a mother of two and the co founder and president of mba mama  an online platform where millennial moms can find the products  services  tools and inspiration they need to pursue an mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her passion for start ups  she s launched four of her own  and women s empowerment shines through in the following post  where she shares a recent experience she had pitching to an all male panel as part of wharton s venture initiation program  vip   her spirit and pluck are evident as well  even amid everything else she s doing  she finds time to blog regularly check out her posts to learn more about some of her other passions  including technology  financial inclusion and african affairs  we re grateful to divinity for lending her voice and perspective to our series </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  mba mama blog  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i don t even know how to ask you questions without sounding like a jerk   this is how the man judging my pitch for mba mama started my   minute q a session yesterday  sensing a tinge of condescension and sarcasm in his voice  i was startled but tried not to show my discomfort  during a series of pitches for wharton s venture initiation program  the judges took a  shark tank  style approach to q a  frequently cutting people off mid sentence and firing off tough questions  my experience was slightly different given that the first words from this particular judge did not propose a question but instead suggested that any feedback or questioning of my ideas meant the judge was being a  jerk   i find this to be fascinating  i plan to spend some time over the next few weeks reflecting on how this all went down  i ll also be archiving the recording of the pitch session to better prepare myself for future experiences like this one </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i found out earlier today that i did not get selected to be part of wharton vip  while this is not unusual given that vip is highly competitive  i wonder how my gender and the gendered focus of my business may have played a role in the tone and direction of the questions i received from the all male panel of judges  interestingly enough  i practiced my pitch during my communications class at wharton and had a male classmate tell me that mba mama is a nice idea but he would not support the business because more mba moms in business schools means less spots for men like him   sideeye</paragraph>
    <paragraph>we would all like to believe that entrepreneurship is a meritocracy where people are judged solely on the viability of their ideas  however  research from professors like laura huang of wharton indicates that investors have a strong bias towards funding and supporting male founders  i just read a case in my entrepreneurship class that talked about the challenges the founders of rent the runway faced trying to convince male vcs a generation removed that they had a viable business aimed at college women  the fact of the matter is that gender biases are prevalent in the entrepreneurial funding landscape and impact the level of support female founders receive  numerous studies show that the number of women in the venture capital industry continues to be abysmal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an entrepreneur i admire very much is commonbond ceo david klein  he famously tells the story of how he was rejected from wharton vip not once  but twice  last month  commonbond announced a series b funding round of     million  meanwhile  there are student ventures that won vip on the first try but have long been abandoned by their founders  clearly  getting rejected by vip is not an indicator of success for student entrepreneurs  this gives me hope that with continued hard work and dedication  i can take mba mama to the next level </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to be clear  i am not saying the judges were biased   or that i deserved to be selected for vip during this application cycle  i know that  despite our traction in the six months since we launched  i need to better communicate our vision to revolutionize the experience of women in the workplace  i also need to do more work to narrow down our target market and refine our monetization plan  i am working on it  and feel grateful to be at wharton where there are numerous opportunities to pivot  innovate and iterate on my ideas  this is also not my first rodeo  i ve founded three other companies and know that it takes grit  scrappiness and determination to be successful as an entrepreneur </paragraph>
    <paragraph>pitching to vip reminded me that the journey ahead will be challenging  me and my business partner  nicole  will likely face many more all male panels  these men hold the checkbooks and the access code to prestigious venture accelerators  it is also relevant that i am a black woman  and nicole is a latina  this presents another unique set of challenges as there are very few people who look like us prepared to make deals that could give mba mama the financing and backing we need to scale </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite the odds against us  mba mama is positioning ourselves to disrupt a work culture where millions of women  especially moms  lack the confidence to apply to business school and lean in to their careers and their destiny  not to mention nearly    percent of highly skilled moms are not working full time or utilizing their elite mba degrees  this presents an incredible market opportunity to empower women and boost global economies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>addressing institutional problems like gender inequality and gender bias that are deeply entrenched in our society is tough work  convincing people that it can be done is even harder  obstacles abound but i am not deterred  i feel confident about the potential for this company and i plan to apply for vip again in the spring  i want to thank all of our subscribers and supporters for continuing to believe in our vision  onward  upward </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  i m going to have a dance party to beyonce with my daughter to celebrate the opportunity to grow  learn  and improve  never give up ladies </paragraph>

  <title>professor perspectives  kellogg professor paul christensen</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>class size  rankings  career placement statistics  location these are all factors that inevitably play a part in where you decide to attend business school  and with good reason  but another vital consideration should be the professors with whom you ll study  the right business school professor can have enormous impact not only on what you learn during your mba but also on the future course of your career </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to help introduce you to some of the leading professors at the world s best business schools  we re launching this new series called professor perspectives  in it  we ll showcase leading instructors from a range of mba programs  their groundbreaking work  their unique teaching styles and more  to kick things off  we d like to introduce you to paul christensen  a clinical professor of finance at northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>christensen teaches courses in microfinance and international business at kellogg and also serves as the academic director for the school s global study programs  immersion experiences that introduce kellogg mba students to international business and markets  prior to joining kellogg in       he was founder and president of shorecap international ltd   a     million london based private equity company that invests in financial institutions in developing countries throughout asia  africa and eastern europe </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a post today on the inside perspective  kellogg s full time mba blog  christensen answered questions about what he teaches  why he teaches and what he hopes students glean from his courses  he also provides some specific advice for prospective applicants considering the kellogg mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what christensen teaches  microfinance is the reason i am at kellogg   he writes  noting that he was first invited to teach this course as an adjunct professor before taking on a full time role at the school  in his microfinance course  he leads students through an examination of the role that development financial institutions play in emerging markets  including helping people access credit  savings and other basic financial services that can improve their lives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>christensen also teaches kellogg s global initiatives in management  gim  classes  as well as an experiential learning course called global lab  in which mba student teams complete project work with overseas organizations  generally involving strategy or marketing   i haven t taught that class recently  but someday i hope to return to it because it s fun to work with students and help them apply what they are learning here at kellogg   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i like to provide students with new insights and understandings into the way that business and capital markets are truly global these days   christensen shares  for example  in his microfinance course he demonstrates the role that national banks and capital markets play by providing capital to support microfinance loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he also likes for his students to develop an appreciation of how business can be a force for social good  he writes  noting that most microfinance organizations have transformed from ngos or non profits to socially motivated  for profit institutions  but examples extend beyond microfinance  he continues   china  for example  has lifted more people out of poverty through industrialization and business expansion that any other country in history   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  he wants to prepare his students to be managers in overseas settings   managers need to pay close attention to the local culture and customs  the difference in working styles and personalities  because without that sensitivity  even the best managers can wind up falling prey to ugly prejudices or simply be ineffective   he writes  to this end  as academic director of kellogg s global programs  christensen has been working with students and staff to identify online cultural awareness intelligence tools that let students test their awareness of a given local culture before they go  as well as how business practices differ between countries  his goal is to see such tools implemented school wide one day </paragraph>

  <title>big shoes to fill at hbs as dee leopold announces plans to step down</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>dee leopold  who has helmed admissions at harvard business school  hbs  for the past decade  will handpick her last class at the school as part of this admissions season  confirming reports that began circulating after an email yesterday to the hbs community from jana kierstead  executive director of harvard s mba program  leopold herself took to her  direct from the director  blog today to share the news with prospective applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s been a fabulous ten years   she wrote   this is a great job and hbs is an amazing place to build a career  i m ready for something new and it s a privilege to have senior leadership that helps navigate change  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her departure will not impact this year s admissions cycle  she stressed   i am here on the job until the class of       that s you   is all set and ready to go   she wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a class act alex brown  who worked in admissions at wharton for years and now serves as a consultant for clear admit  was impressed by leopold s blog post   it s a nice touch to reach out to the applicants and be so forthright   he said  in fact  leopold has helped revolutionize mba admissions at harvard and more broadly  in part through the transparency she s offered into the process through her blog and otherwise </paragraph>
    <paragraph> dee leopold has not only transformed the admissions process at harvard business school  she has helped shape today s admissions process at many leading mba programs across the globe   says graham richmond  a clear admit co founder who has gone on to launch his own firm advising admissions offices themselves   before dee took the reigns as director  the school was infamous for a highly opaque admissions process with many referring to admissions at hbs as a  black box    he continues   under her watch  hbs admissions charted an entirely different course and introduced a level of transparency and frankness heretofore unknown in mba admissions  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the changes leopold helped implement were the prompt issuing of interview invitations in batches on set days and the  release  of candidates not invited to interview on a fixed date earlier in the process so that they can regroup and pursue other options  richmond points out   perhaps most notably  hbs reduced the number of required essays drastically and sought to make the on campus interview process a first class experience  offering specialized side activities for prospective students to take part in during their campus stay   he adds </paragraph>

  <title>darden hosts inaugural diversity week</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last week  the darden school of business at the university of virginia hosted five full days of events  panels and workshops devoted to exploring the challenges and benefits of diversity in business  the darden student association  dsa  and the diversity student advisory group  dsag  helped launch this inaugural darden diversity week as part of an effort to place discussion of diversity related issues front and center within the darden community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the idea for a week focused on diversity was first raised by darden s student liaisons from the consortium for graduate study in management  a nonprofit organization devoted to increasing the representation of african americans  hispanic americans and native americans in business schools and corporate management  the suggestion  coming on the heels of a year in which a range of events focused the nation s attention on both race relations and marriage equality  was readily embraced by the dsa s first ever vice president of diversity  second year mba student patricia martin  previously  the dsa had a single vice president for both diversity and international students  but in recognition of the fact that the needs of the two groups are different  the roles were broken apart this past year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one of my main goals in this new position was to take a more proactive approach to discussing diversity   martin says  acknowledging that several campus affinity groups did host discussions around diversity last year in reaction to national events   i really wanted to think about incorporating diversity into the darden fabric in a more proactive way   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and so diversity week was born  when approached by the consortium student liaisons with the idea at the end of last year  martin suggested that responsibility for coordinating the week s events fall to the vp of diversity so that it would involve the entire darden community and have continuity from one year to the next  working closely with dsag  the consortium student liaisons and numerous other campus affinity groups  martin scheduled a week full of events devoted to diversity in all of its forms  including ethnicity  gender  nationality  thought  culture and religion all with a focus on its impact on business </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is what businesses and corporations are thinking about  and we wanted to make sure that darden students are exposed to these issues before they go to their internships and jobs   martin says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>events each day explore different diversity issues the week s programming kicked off with a first coffee on monday morning  followed by a panel discussion on education inequality and the stem  science  technology  engineering  math  pipeline led by representatives from hewlett packard and boston consulting group  co sponsors included the black business student forum  bbsf   hispanic american network at darden  the technology club and the education club </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on tuesday  darden s own professor martin davidson led a workshop on leveraging difference  helping participants think about how to talk about diversity without getting stuck in political correctness  the workshop was delivered in two sessions  one for first year students and a second for second year students  faculty and staff   professor davidson is an expert in the field of leveraging diversity and having uncomfortable conversations in all areas diversity of race  thought  backgrounds  he helped us learn how to break down barriers and be a bit more vulnerable to people  which allows you to have more difficult discussions   martin says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another panel focused on lgbtq policies  specifically on how to attract and retain lgbtq talent  this panel  co sponsored by pride at darden  included representatives from mckinsey and johnson   johnson  graduate women in business and the finance club co sponsored their own panel on women in finance  drawing representatives from amazon  goldman sachs  harris william and j p  morgan </paragraph>
    <paragraph>participation from so many high profile companies really helped draw people to the events  martin says  she estimates that between forty and fifty percent of darden students attended at least one of the week s events   the fact that companies like mckinsey  j j  bcg and goldman sachs are supporting this has been another stamp of approval   she says   these companies believe in the value of diversity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>complementing the serious tenor of many of the week s events were more social activities as well  such as the bbsf pink party on thursday night in support of breast cancer awareness  this event  which took place at a popular mexican restaurant in downtown charlottesville  was co sponsored by multiple affinity groups  including the adam smith society  darden capital management  the general management   operations club and the marketing club </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dsa also coordinated with darden s office of admissions  which each year hosts a series of  darden days  for prospective applicants  many of which target specific groups of applicants  such as members of the military or women   admissions worked with us so that the darden days focused on diversity fell during diversity week   martin says  in this way  prospective applicants considering darden got a first hand glimpse of the ways in which the community is coming together around issues of diversity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>goal to host a diversity event each month in addition to coordinating diversity week  martin has also set a goal of planning at least one diversity event every month  in september  dsa hosted a black lives matter panel  october brought diversity week  and a diversity theater is scheduled for november  she s also working on a future panel that will address issues of religious diversity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she has also worked to involve not only full time mba students  but participants in darden s executive and global mba programs  an emba student sat in on the black lives panel  and the event was streamed for students not on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by planning events each month rather than holding events in reactions to issues that arise martin hopes to allow for better discussion and greater curiosity   i think we will get better results when we offer events as an opportunity to learn from each other rather something happening in the news and diversity suddenly getting thrown in people s face   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martin s successor as dsa vp of diversity will inherit responsibility for continuing diversity week  and she hopes to leave him or her positioned to expand on this year s efforts   we re only here for two years  you re only on leadership for one and there are so many moving parts involved in planning an event like this   she says   this is the first time we have done this  but i will leave guidelines for whoever follows me  so it won t be reinventing the wheel  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>watch an interview about diversity week and diversity at darden featuring dsa vice president of diversity patricia martin and darden associate director of diversity recruiting karen ohen </paragraph>

  <title>oxford said hosts lively debate on corporate responsibility</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of its annual mba launch program  oxford university s said business school recently hosted a debate between faculty members that addressed whether corporations are responsible for practicing social responsibility as part of their business models </paragraph>
    <paragraph>oxford alumni accompanied debaters oren sussman  reader in finance  and richard barker  professor of accounting  in the discussion  sussman s assertion was that corporations should use their resources to focus on making money rather than filter them into working toward change in areas such as the climate crisis and social inequality  barker s team held the opposing opinion that while corporations should obviously function for profit  responsibility toward such societal issues can and should be integrated into their practices to achieve a greater goal </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>barker used the examples of big tobacco  the soft drink and fast food industries  and the over consumption of fossil fuels to assert that when corporations fail to recognize interests other than profit  the consequences are destructive  this team noted that innovation in a changing world is vital to the success of any business  and that consciousness of issues affecting the planet only benefit the health of a corporation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> do you invest in staff and train them in new technologies  or do you innovate out of the problem     do  you falsify papers  or cut corners  or do you slip stuff out of the pipe into the river   quizzed oxford said alumna leo johnson  a specialist in sustainability and climate change  as part of the debate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the debate ended with a student vote  in which a large majority agreed that corporations are responsible for taking part in global sustainability </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba launch initiated new students to lifetime membership in the oxford union  the university s debate society  founded in      </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  mba data guru analyzes interview acceptance rates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week  we ve had the pleasure of connecting with wayne atwell  a second year mba student at nyu stern school of business  who is perhaps better known as the mba data guru  in january       while in the midst of applying to business school himself  he launched a website with that name after crunching numbers to figure out his own chances of getting into the various schools where he had applied   atwell is pictured above  far right  with his stern block and their strategy professor  sonia marciano  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in using data to answer his own questions about the mba application process  he realized he was also answering the questions of other mba applicants  and so www mbadataguru com was born  as for why and how he s kept updating it  even now amid the hectic pace of a full time mba program   mainly i like playing around with data   he says   i find it fun   but he s also gotten to chat with lots of mba applicants  learned a bit about web development and managed to grow an audience  he adds   still  it s more of a hobby than anything else  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fortunately for those who ve come to value his analysis of all things mba admissions  we have good news  it s a hobby he plans to continue even after he lands a consulting job post mba   he s currently interviewing with bcg  mckinsey and a few other firms   so you can expect to see more posts like the following as atwell s time permits  read on to learn what data has shown him about the relationship between getting invited to interview and gaining acceptance at a range of leading mba programs  and be sure to visit his site for more fascinating data driven analyses of the mba admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  www mbadataguru com  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba interview acceptance rate by rank</paragraph>
    <paragraph>so you have just been invited to interview at the mba school of your dreams  obviously this raises your chance of getting in  but by how much  in general  top ten schools have lower mba interview acceptance rates while schools ranked    to    have a higher acceptance rate for applicants who were interviewed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the acceptance rate ranges from     to     for schools in the top     the average mba interview acceptance rate for the top    is     and it is     for schools ranked    to    </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>nyu jumps out as the highest acceptance rate by a wide margin  if you have been selected to interview at stern then you can prepare to open a bottle of champagne because you are probably going to business school  no other school in the top    has an interview acceptance rate above     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the other end of the spectrum is kellogg and tuck with the lowest acceptance rates  these two schools will allow anyone who visits campus to interview  so it is not surprising that they admit significantly fewer applicants who are interviewed  most of the top    schools have an acceptance rate clustered between     and     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>duke has the lowest acceptance rate for a school not in the top    at      the rest of the schools range from     to     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck and don t forget to prepare for your mba interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  the data used to create the analysis on www mbadataguru com comes from gmat club  the data only represents a small percentage of the total applicants  roughly      and may be biased based on the source  therefore  results may not be      accurate and are meant to give you a rough idea of your chance of admission </paragraph>

  <title>hbs soars to top of bloomberg businessweek s new mba rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>when duke s fuqua school of business topped bloomberg businessweek s mba rankings last year  the magazine came under fire for a methodology that many claimed was flawed  this year  an overhauled methodology has yielded vastly different results  including harvard business school s taking the no    spot for the first time in the    year history of the rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our annual ranking of full time mba programs now focuses on what most people hope to get after business school  a satisfying  well paying job   read the commentary that accompanied the rankings  using a deeper and broader set of data than ever before drawn from        current students         alumni and       recruiters from     different mba programs bloomberg bw s rankings are now the combination of five weighted measurements  an employer survey  accounting for    percent of the total score   an alumni survey drawing feedback from the classes of            and          percent   a student survey of members of the class of          percent   the school s job placement rate     percent  and average starting salary     percent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when evaluated in this revised way  the new mba rankings reveal findings more in line with u s  news and world report  considered by many mba admissions consultants to be among the most accurate of the multiple rankings that crowd the field  the usual suspects rise to the top in large part  although there are some major exceptions like stanford only appearing on the list at no     dartmouth s tuck school not making it into the top     it ranked   th   and nyu stern plummeting to   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the top    schools according to bloomberg bw s new rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   harvard business school    university of chicago booth school of business    kellogg s northwestern school of management    mit sloan school of management    university of pennsylvania s wharton school    columbia business school    stanford graduate school of business    duke university s fuqua school of business    uc berkeley s haas school of business    university of michigan s ross school of business</paragraph>
    <paragraph>not only did hbs and fuqua swap spots  the first jumping seven spots to no    and the second plummeting from first to eighth   no school in the top    held the same rank this year as it did last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the strength of the programs at any of the individual schools didn t shift so dramatically from one year to the next instead it s the change in methodology that accounts for the vast variation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> with a sharper focus on what people most hope to get after business school  we think we ve created the most effective ranking yet for helping career oriented students choose an mba program   read the bloomberg bw commentary </paragraph>
    <paragraph>reflecting its self professed aim of better measuring what people hope to get out of business school  the new ranking does offer a slick interactive element allowing readers to type in a school name to reveal adjusted charts reflecting pay growth  percent of students heading to startups  the percentage of graduates entering various industry sectors  where new grads end up in terms of u s  region  average mba debt and job placement three months post mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg bw acknowledges that its new rankings methodology means that a school can rank highly overall even as it falls farther down the list in terms of the individual elements measured  hbs  for example  took the no    spot despite the fact that it ranked   th for job placement  no    chicago booth ranked second in terms of job placement  but only   th in terms of what its alumni had to say about their experience  a crazy looking chart helps showcase these variations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg bw also features a separate ranking of international mba program  topped again by western university s ivey business school in canada this year  as it was last year  the magazine s ranking of part time mba programs places northwestern s kellogg school at the top of the list </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you can view the entire      bloomberg businessweek mba rankings here  as always  those of us here at clear admit urge prospective applicants to use rankings as just one of many factors when evaluating which business school will best suit your individual needs and goals </paragraph>

  <title>applicant reports via livewire shed light on hbs  chicago booth interview invitations</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit s mba livewire has been ablaze with submissions over the past two weeks  prompting us to perform a little data analysis  though we ve been hearing from people who ve applied to a range of schools  the greatest concentration of reports have involved harvard business school  hbs  and the university of chicago booth s school of business  each of which has been busy both issuing invitations to interview and  releasing  candidates from consideration </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what did we find when we charted the results  let s take a look at hbs first </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those who were invited to interview  reported gpas ranged from     to      with an average of      the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      notably  the ranges and averages were much the same for those who got a ding   the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of       roughly one third of those who reported their hbs fates via livewire shared that they had been invited to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what conclusions can be drawn from this data  basically  the story is that everyone has great stats  so it is more than simply a stellar gpa or gmat score that gets someone an interview invitation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  we should note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who scored well on the gmat or had strong gpas may be more inclined to share their numbers publically  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>a look at data for chicago booth reveals similar patterns  here  reported gpas for applicants who have received an invitation to interview ranged from     to       with an average of      gmat scores  meanwhile  fell between     and      with an average score of      for those who got dinged  gpas ranged from      to      averaging       and gmat scores ranged from     to      with an average of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with chicago booth data  as with the data regarding hbs applicants  the sample size was small and selection bias may also be at play  interestingly  though  with chicago booth  reports of interview invitations made to livewire far outnumbered reports of rejections  with almost    percent of respondents sharing that they are now prepping for an interview  this likely has to do with the fact that chicago booth historically has interviewed between    and    percent of applicants  compared to the    percent that hbs generally opts to meet in person </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here s hoping the interview goes well for all who received an invitation  don t forget clear admit s interviews guides for hbs and chicago booth  which can help you prepare  thanks for sharing your results via clear admit s livewire  keep  em coming </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  duke   fuqua alum on how team fuqua is central to duke culture</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>happy friday  we re back again this week with another edition of fridays from the frontlines  this week we bring you steven ma  duke   fuqua alum  class of        prior to fuqua  steven graduated from oregon state university with a degree in biology   not your traditional mba applicant  when steven made the leap into the mba world  he found that the resources just weren t there for him  his blog  from bench to board  aims to chronicle his experiences and learnings with the aim of helping those who are interested in earning an mba without the traditional mba applicant background </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we welcome the contributions of other current mba students and applicants  as well as alumni  please email jeanette or marianne if you would like to add your voice to the mix  many thanks to jeremy for his great post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post was contributed for publication on clear admit by steven ma  author of from bench to board  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a duke mba alum   this is a new title that is going to take some time getting used to </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i m happy to be finally back in the workforce and it s been interesting seeing how the duke mba has changed my approach to things  with the mba application season starting up soon   fuqua s early admission round interviews should be starting   i wanted to get back to blogging and supporting the mba applicant community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the mba application season has heated up again  i ve been getting more and more requests for informational interviews on the duke mba  one question i get a lot is   what is duke looking for in an applicant  i figured this would be a topic worth dedicating some time to and help prospective students understand what business leadership means at fuqua </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the bottom line is this   any top mba program is looking for the same basic things in an applicant  these are the following  solid work experience  leadership potential  ability to work in teams  having a good job outlook  etc  however  there are nuances to this and fuqua does have a slightly different approach </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rather than compare fuqua to other programs directly  which is impossible to do anyway   i thought i d share what leadership at the duke mba means to me and provide some insight on what fuqua looks for in applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i ve divided this new series  how the duke mba makes leaders  in multiple posts  as i ve done before for other series </paragraph>
    <paragraph>almost everyone puts collaboration on their resume or cover letters  but it s much easier said than done  gone are the days of a winning at all costs or a top down mentality in business  and the most successful leaders i ve engaged with are able to collaborate with others and create a culture of collaboration in their teams  this is particularly important as new mbas and even senior leaders need to motivate their colleagues without necessarily having influence over them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but what is collaboration and what does it mean within the context of the duke mba  at fuqua  we are taught to work collectively toward a common vision and to actively look for win win situations  there is a pervasive sense that only if the team wins  i e  the program and your classmates  then it s counted as a true success  this is true for both classroom work and extracurricular activities  it s not enough to just complete a class project or land a job after school   but ensuring that your classmates also grow and have the support they need to be successful </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is not something i m only saying because it sounds good  starting from orientation  students are institutionalized into the team fuqua culture  in our diverse c lead teams in the first year  we learn how to effectively collaborate with diverse teammates hands on  there are also a lot of extracurricular activities that require working well with classmates and faculty   from club events to initiatives that aim to make the mba experience better for future classes  i strongly believe that fuqua s student led spirit and its culture of collaboration gives it a competitive advantage in the mba  marketplace  as we can be nimble and adapt the program to suit the changing mba employment environment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for example  i got involved with two new student clubs that were formed by students my year who wanted to make fuqua a better place  as part of c lead    for rising second years   i also observed the participation of my classmates and the dedication of the faculty on developing initiatives to improve the mba experience  during recruiting season  i participated in self formed health care recruiting teams where we offered each other company specific intel and interview practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you ever took game theory  you can see that collaboration creates the win win scenario in the prisoner s dilemma  however  balancing your own desire for individual success and navigating the political environment is never easy  what i realized is that collaboration is easier at fuqua because the culture supports it  when you leave fuqua  it s up to you to take what you ve learned and create a collaborative environment around you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the duke mba is a safe environment for students to develop into collaborative leaders  i ve come to appreciate all the internal obstacles i needed to overcome at fuqua when collaborating with my classmates   now realizing that it was all practice for my future roles after school  during recruiting season  i remember that i was juggling many different important projects  from recruiting to trying to get a biotech start up off the ground  but i also had to dedicate a considerable amount of energy in supporting my classmates  also consider how diverse our teams are  i e  language and cultural barriers  and you ll see that it can be a stressful environment  you know what  though  the business world is just as diverse </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking back  i definitely felt pushed both physically and mentally during those times  but the most important thing was that i learned how to collaborate even when it was hard to do so  it took a lot of effort to slow the team discussion down so everyone was aligned  or setting aside the bandwidth so i could properly interview candidates for the class of      as a second year admissions fellow  but it has all paid off  now finally an alum  i realize how the duke mba has prepared me to collaborate in the real world   through practice   every day for two years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if learning to become a collaborative leader is something that genuinely resonates with you  then i would highly recommend the duke mba  understanding why collaboration is important and demonstrating that you possess a collaborative mindset is something that is high on the list of what fuqua seeks in its applicants </paragraph>

  <title>chicago booth maintains no    spot in economist s ranking of full time mba programs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the university of chicago booth school of business snagged the number one spot for the fourth year running in the economist s ranking of full time mba programs  the which mba        released today  using a methodology that gives great weight to student and alumni experiences  the economist each year generates a list of the top     full time international mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>booth s strong performance in the overall rankings can be attributed chiefly to its ability to provide new career opportunities to its graduates  the school ranked tops out of all     schools both for the diversity of its recruiters and in terms of its students  assessment of career services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>coming in at number two this year was the university of virginia s darden school of business up one position from last year to yield the school s best ever showing in the which mba  ranking  darden bested all other schools in the specialty ranking for  personal development and education experience  and also had a strong showing  no     for  student rating of faculty  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden s strong performance in the which mba rankings was a welcome though not shocking development for newly minted darden dean scott beardsley  who assumed his post just a few months ago   a depth of learning happens at darden that does not happen anywhere else   beardsley said in a statement announcing the school s advancement in the rankings   it s intensive  it s inspiring  it s life changing  there really is no better place to realize your full potential as a leader and to advance your career   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dartmouth s tuck school of business flip flopped with darden in the which mba  list this year  slipping from no    last year to no     tuck got strong marks for the diversity of its recruiters and its  student rating of alumni effectiveness  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  elbowed its way into the top five snagging the no    spot this year  up from no    in       it s most highly ranked specialty areas were the diversity of its recruiters and the post mba salary its graduates report  france s hec paris rounded out this year s top five  slipping slightly from its  th place ranking last year  its strongest showings were in terms of increase in salary and potential to network </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and stanford graduate school of business  which often cluster at the top of other rankings  did not perform as well in the economist s line up  wharton took   th and stanford gsb came in at no     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a new twist this year  the economist introduced a  compare schools  tool that enables readers to select up to four schools and compare them side to side across a range of fields  as in years past  the economist employs a complicated methodology based on two surveys and a system of weighted averages to arrive at its rankings  the first survey is a quantitative survey completed by the schools themselves on matters such as graduates  salaries  average gmat scores and number of registered alumni  accounting for roughly    percent of the ranking  the second survey  accounting for    percent of the ranking  is qualitative in nature and completed by a school s current mba students and recent alumni  assessing things such as the quality of faculty  facilities and career services departments  the response rate to this survey must be at least    percent of the latest intake or    students alumni  whichever is lower  for a school to be included in the rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>responses to these two surveys help the economist rank schools according to four main factors  which are also weighted  opening new career opportunities     percent   personal development educational experience     percent   increase to salary     percent  and potential to network     percent   finally  the economist builds memory into the rankings by taking a weighted average of the three prior years  data         and    percent respectively  this is done  according to the economist s published description of its methodology last year   to provide a rounded picture of the school  sudden movements in data  which might not produce an immediate increase in quality  are thus reflected gradually  much as the improvement would affect students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  those of us here at clear admit encourage prospective applicants to use rankings as just one of many criteria in determining which mba program may be the best fit for your individual background  needs and goals </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>every wednesday  we share a round up of the latest news from admissions blogs at the top business schools  in this week s edition of mba admissions mashup  we take a look at students  summer overseas experiences  how top business schools are celebrating diversity and emphasizing social impact  in addition to our usual sourcing of advice and tips from various adcom teams </paragraph>
    <paragraph>uc berkeley   haas executive mba students spent a valuable week in rio de janeiro  brazil as part of an  immersion week focused on entrepreneurship  multi national corporations  and sports marketing especially timely in a country focused on preparing to host the      summer olympics   not only did the students get to experience a vibrant culture while gaining valuable business experience  they formed stronger bonds with their cohort    ultimately  what i learned most was a further reinforcement to my greatest takeaway in the berkeley mba for executives program that it is all about people and nurturing lifelong relationships  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>guest student blogger  avi sethi t     shared his experiences during his summer internship in monsoon season  sweat  and a trip around the world  my summer internship  through the monsoon humidity and the crowded commutes  avi was able to reflect on the importance of diverse experiences and how his first year at tuck prepared him for the challenges ahead   when i was recruiting for internships my first year  i wanted to find something unique  something that would stretch me in a way i had never been before  i guess this was the appropriate result i was drawn to zaya because of the challenges existing in the education venture capital space as well as the opportunity to go abroad as part of my summer away from tuck  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for guest blogger  ross bloomer  coming from southern california  fuqua s emphasis on diversity and inclusion was a welcome surprise and attending the duke mba lgbt weekend sealed the deal   now that i m currently enrolled  i can only confirm and expand upon how fantastic fuqua is for lgbt students  fuquapride has given me an immediate group of best friends and even second year student mentors as i jump into a new world of classes and recruitment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcdonough second year  jonah trout  raves about georgetown s lgbt onboarding being a factor in his comfort at one of the top business schools  upon being admitted to the program   i was paired with an out  gay second year student mentor who was invaluable to me throughout my onboarding process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and  in harvard s lgbt spotlight  alterrell mills explains that  as a member of the black and lgbt community  i know the importance of belonging to a community that provides a support system and empowers its members to play an active role in the broader community  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this week at lbs  community took on a different  but just as important meaning as the student association launched lbs for london  the initiative provides the opportunity for over     students  staff  and faculty to give back to the greater london community  victoria hanau wrote that  it was to connect with london and the local community   students helped clean two areas of the garden to help prepare the area for new vegetation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as many programs are issuing interview invites and already sending out admissions decisions  oxford on friday   mit sloan s mba admissions committee went into what happens after clicking submit on your application   we will begin sending out interview invitations in mid october and continue until the week of november  th  at which point each applicant will receive an updated status   while mit sloan values the interview and no applicant gets admitted without one  where one conducts the interview has no bearing on one s application  especially considering budgetary and time constraints   for those who can make it  we host a special program for on campus interviewees  including lunch with current students and a class visit  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for interviews  which  by the way  are being added to livewire as we speak   tuck s adcom emphasizes the need to relax  be yourself  and know yourself  in addition to doing your homework of course    the admissions committee wants to know the real you  not who you think we want you to be  it s hard to speak convincingly about your experiences and goals when you re busy trying to get into the interviewer s head  you ll risk coming across as canned or insincere   we don t want that  now do we  head over to the clear admit interview guides to get school specific advice on the most prevalent questions posed for each school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many of you may already be getting your acceptances to some of the top schools  see columbia   soon you ll be tasked with making a choice  there s no better way to experience the program than to plan a visit  sit in on classes  and meet with current students  when s the best time  the ross admissions blog has the answer for you  while there s a big range  ross admissions director soojin kwon says   when students are on campus and classes are in session   september to november or january through february  that way  you ll get to sit in on classes and experience what students experience  we have visit options outside of those times  of course  but the best times are when students are here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that s all for this week  join us next week for the latest edition of mba admissions mashup </paragraph>

    <paragraph>hiscocks states in the article   our goal is to make sure there is a pod point wherever you park for an hour or more  this includes at home  at work and at destinations where you stop frequently </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that way  whenever you return to your car it s always fully charged  our network in the u k  continues to grow but we want to see some more coverage here and then move full throttle into europe  </paragraph>

  <title>hbs admissions director  impressed    pleased    proud  and on schedule</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>yesterday  harvard business school  hbs  managing director of admissions and financial aid dee leopold had some glowing things to say about applicants in this year s first round at hbs   all of us in dillon are impressed   she wrote in a post to her director s blog   impressed that you met such an early deadline  impressed at the variety of ways in which you  introduced yourselves   impressed that you have all worked so hard to do well   she wrote  she and her team  meanwhile  are both pleased and proud to be part of a place that applicants see as  a training ground for aspirational leadership   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these warm  almost effusive words from leopold  who is perhaps better known for her direct  no nonsense style  suggest that the hbs admissions director is indeed quite pleased with the initial responses she and her team received from the new  introduce yourself  essay prompt that debuted this admission season </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the real news in her post  of course  was about the interview invitations that her team would send out to anxious applicants eagerly awaiting them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first round of invites would go at at    noon et today  to roughly     round   applicants  she shared yesterday  another     invitations  total  will go out in subsequent batches on october  th and   th  she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we have it on good authority through posts to clear admit s livewire and elsewhere  that leopold was true to her word and that invites did indeed begin trickling out right around the lunch hour in boston </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one applicant posting on gmat club shared the entire text of the interview invite email  the message  according to that post  began as follows </paragraph>
    <paragraph> warm greetings from harvard business school  after careful consideration of your application materials  we would like to get to know you better  this is our invitation to interview  take a moment and exhale  then keep reading  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as leopold promised in her blog post yesterday  the invitation did contain detailed instructions for how to schedule an interview   the online scheduling system will go live on wednesday  october  th  at    noon  et   at which point  but no earlier   those who have received an invitation will be able to register for a specific interview slot by logging into their hbs application  interview slots will be assigned on a first come  first served basis  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the invitation also shared details about where interviews will take place   we conduct interviews on campus and all over the world  we even do some via skype   it read  regardless of where or how you choose to interview  all interviews are conducted by a member of the mba admissions board  the invitation continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t sweat it if you didn t receive your invite today didn t get an interview invitation today  all hope is not lost  again  hbs expects to issue another     invites between now and october   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph> please don t speculate about the day you receive the interview invitation   leopold stressed   it s not about you  it s about us and how we set internal deadlines for applications to be read  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all interview invitations for     candidates will go out as part of the october   th wave  leopold continued in her blog post  that means no news for this group on october  th or  th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on october   th  leopold and her team will also  release  candidates who are not moving forward in the process   we hope that by doing this early  we are enabling this group to pursue other options sooner vs  later   she wrote  another group of applicants which leopold anticipates will number around     will learn on the   th that they ve been bumped to round    where hbs will  further consider  their applications </paragraph>
    <paragraph>parting words from leopold   please don t send any additional materials or letters of support  we ve designed an evaluation process that we believe is as thorough and fair as we can make it  it s not perfect  but it certainly is a process to which we dedicate a tremendous amount of care and concern  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  did you get one of those     coveted invitations to interview today    we want to know and so do your peers  so by all means share your news on livewire  now might also be a good time to check out the clear admit hbs interview guide  filled with first hand accounts from prior applicants who interviewed  hbs specific interview prep strategy and detailed analysis of some of the interview questions hbs has posed most often in the past </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you didn t get the good word today  stay strong and positive  we ll be rooting for you again on the  th and the   th </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  kindergarten teacher  with mba from ross  pursues lifelong tech dream</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how does a kindergarten teacher with a liberal arts degree score an internship at apple  find out in this week s edition of fridays from the frontline  jeremy schifeling  helped in part by an mba from the university of michigan s ross school  not only landed a marketing internship on apple s ios team  he went on to work at several educational tech firms and at linkedin before founding his own company designed to help others from non tech backgrounds break into the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he contacted us and generously offered to share his story  complete with data revealing that there are three times as many non tech job opportunities for mbas at internet firms  in marketing  hr  business development  etc   as there are positions for computer science  cs  majors and engineers  so if you re from a non tech background and want to know how make the shift  this post s for you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we welcome the contributions of other current mba students and applicants  as well as alumni  please email jeanette or marianne if you would like to add your voice to the mix  many thanks to jeremy for his great post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post was contributed for publication on clear admit by jeremy schifeling  ceo of break into tech  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i ve always been a huge nerd  while all my childhood friends were outside playing football  i was busy installing dos on my first computer  and when i should have been writing book reports  i was  instead  blogging on prodigy before blogging was even a thing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but i never thought i d get a chance to actually work on my nerdy passions  not with the scarlet letter that i wore ever since college  a liberal arts degree eek  no cs major  no tech job  i always assumed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so instead  i started my career as a kindergarten teacher  and though i d try to find outlets for my geekdom building a class website  teaching my students powerpoint i figured that was as close to the tech world as i was ever going to get </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  many years later  it was with great trepidation that i entered business school at the university of michigan s ross school  especially because on the first day  i met no fewer than seven former engineers who not only wanted the same tech jobs i did  but who were actually qualified to get them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but here s the crazy thing  fast forward exactly eight months from that first day of orientation and i was on my way to a different kind of orientation new intern training at apple  sure enough  i was lucky enough to land a plum marketing internship on the ios team  the exact same role that all those engineers coveted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and here s the crazier thing  i wasn t alone  on that same bus headed to cupertino was a former snowboard designer  a former navy submariner and a former manager at china s largest egg processing facility  and not a single computer science degree between the four of us </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how was this possible  how did we all make the transition into a world that can feel so forbidding to non techies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the secret is in the data  because if you crunch the numbers on linkedin and i have it turns out that for all of silicon valley s geekiness  three quarters of its jobs are non technical in nature </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>which just makes sense if you think about it  sure  it takes a lot of coders to make an awesome app  but it takes even more hr people to hire those coders  project managers to keep them organized and marketers to bring their work out to the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and the result is that there are tens of thousands of liberal arts folks working in tech just like me </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>so if you re also a nerd or like me  a nerd in hiding know this  the tech world is wide open for business  just don t be afraid to knock on its door </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jeremy schifeling is the founder and ceo of break into tech  a resource site for anyone who wants to land a great tech job no matter their background </paragraph>

  <title>understanding the mba admissions interview  part ii</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this is the second in a three part series on the mba admissions interview  in case you missed it  view part i here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>okay now that you re clear on open interviews and interviews by invitation  let s get into some of the finer points  what s this about blind versus non blind interviews  you ask  some schools believe strongly in the notion of blind interviews  which means that your interviewer will know nothing about you in advance of the interview other than what appears on the resume you give them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools that fall firmly into this camp include yale school of management  som   columbia business school and the university of chicago booth school of business  we should note that at uva s darden school  the mba admissions interview is truly blind  meaning the interviewer will not have read or reviewed either your application or your resume   it is our policy to conduct blind interviews  so there is no need to send or bring in your resume for the interview   reads the darden website  in general  though  most business schools who conduct blind interviews intend that to mean that the interviewer has access to a resume and nothing more </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we use blind interviews that is  based on the resume only  with the interviewer not seeing any other part of the candidate s application to allow the interviewer to give us as independent an assessment of the candidate as possible  without being influenced by the academic record  gmat score  essay  etc    says yale som s bruce delmonico  who leads admission for the new haven school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>blind interviews offer applicants both advantages and disadvantages  admissions experts say   i ve always liked blind interviews because the applicant gets a bit of clean slate   says graham richmond  who co founded clear admit before launching his own consulting firm advising leading business school admissions teams  there s no bias that might come with the interviewer having seen grades  scores  recommendation letters or the like  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that said  this doesn t mean a blind interview gives candidates open license to reinvent their candidacy   richmond cautions   the interview should be consistent with the written application that is ultimately submitted  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>from the school s perspective  blind interviews also make it feasible to draw from a larger group of interviewers including alumni and second year students  a blind interview doesn t require that these interviewers be fully versed in a candidate s full application or be trained to limit biases that could result from having this fuller view before the interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alex brown  who worked in admissions at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school for many years  views blind interviews as  additive  in that they represent an additional data point like essays or recommendation letters  non blind interviews  in contrast  brown views as  iterative    these give the adcom the opportunity to dive deeper into the applicant   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gsb conducts some blind  some non blind interviews at stanford graduate school of business  gsb   whether your interview will be blind or non blind depends on who does the interviewing   the only information about you that your alumni interviewer will have is your resume  which you will send directly to him her   writes stanford gsb assistant dean for mba admissions derrick bolton on the school website   we will not provide your alumni interviewer with your application  nor will we use your application to identify specific areas for your alumni interviewer to probe   he continues  adding that stanford believes the bias that could result from such guidance to alumni could outweigh potential benefit from an evaluation standpoint </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gives its alumni interviewers a structure and topics to address with applicants  although it trusts the interviewers  judgment in terms of pursuing topics more deeply that might be of particular relevance for an individual applicant  bolton continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but some interviews at stanford gsb are conducted by members of the admissions staff  in which case the interviewer will have reviewed a candidate s complete application before the interview  according to bolton   as such  he or she may conduct an interview that reflects this knowledge of your application   bolton writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>richmond notes that the  clean slate  provided by the blind interview format can actually pose a challenge for some applicants   a blind interview requires applicants to start from scratch  which is often a difficult task if you ve just poured your heart and soul into a lengthy application   he says  the non blind format can also allow for a more productive  meaty  conversation to some extent  he adds </paragraph>

  <title>understanding the mba admissions interview  part i</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with harvard business school  hbs  slated to issue its first batch of invitations today  the mba admissions world is buzzing about one thing  interviews  hbs  of course  is not alone  at dartmouth s tuck school of business  which features applicant initiated interviews  hopeful candidates have been traipsing back and forth to hanover already for several weeks  and columbia business school  cbs  has also already been busy interviewing applicants for its early decision round </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with so much interview anxiety in the air and knowing that it only stands to build from here we ve decided to devote this week at clear admit to all things interview  we re getting the ball rolling with this multi part series  which we like to think of as an mba admissions interview primer of sorts  in it  we ll unpack the different types of interviews open  invited  blind  non blind   resume based  behavioral based  team based  etc  and take a look at why particular schools choose the interview variations they do  along the way  we ll offer some tips for how best to prepare for each and explore a few of the more interesting wrinkles in the world of mba interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when all is said and done  you still may not feel fully ready to ace that hbs interview  but you ll have a much firmer grasp on the mba interview landscape as a whole  which we hope will better prepare you for interviews at all of your target schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>open interviews versus invited interviews we mentioned in the intro that tuck has something called applicant initiated interviews  also known as open interviews  they are what they sound like  at tuck and a handful of other schools kellogg s northwestern school of management  emory s goizuieta school  duke s fuqua school and unc s kenan flagler business school  for example applicants do indeed get to choose to interview  there s no need to wait or stress over receiving an interview invitation  just schedule a date  pack your bags and go </paragraph>
    <paragraph> at tuck every applicant has the opportunity to visit campus  not only for an interview but to sit in on a class with a current student  attend an information session with an admissions officer  take a student led tour and have lunch with current students   says tuck admissions director dawna clarke   we want to make tuck accessible to all applicants who are interested in seeing it firsthand  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other schools  of course  also make their campuses  classrooms and students accessible to prospective applicants who want a firsthand glimpse  but far fewer schools offer the opportunity to interview to any prospective applicant who so chooses </paragraph>
    <paragraph> ultimately we have the open interview policy at tuck to meet as many prospective students as we can   clarke says   we do this because it is difficult to make judgements strictly based on a written application   after all  what if an absolutely phenomenal applicant for one reason or another just didn t fully come to life on paper  without an open interview policy  that applicant would quite likely end up in the deny pile </paragraph>
    <paragraph> to have that personal interaction is very valuable to us   clarke says   and while it is not required  we want to provide the opportunity to everyone who applies  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the opportunity to initiate your own interview at tuck  goizueta  fuqua or kenan flagler only lasts until the open interview period ends at a given school or capacity is met  each school then switches to invitation only interviews  in which selected candidates are invited to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at kellogg  offering interviews to any applicant who wants one has been a longstanding philosophy  says beth tidmarsh  director of admissions for full time mba programs   we really want to evaluate the whole person  and the application process is holistic  we still seek to interview everyone who applies as many as we can   she says  acknowledging that not all candidates can travel to evanston for on campus interviews  tidmarsh adds that her team also uses alumni interviewers around the world   we will match candidates in their home locations to conduct interviews with alumni  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is interesting to note that kellogg s open invitation offer is only for those who do apply  the other schools mentioned in fact allow anyone to interview  even before submitting an application  the latter policy allows schools to potentially cast an even wider net in the applicant pool  although it is obviously more resource intensive  especially given that some of those who interview may ultimately not decide to apply </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  mit sloan mba student  veteran discusses humility and success</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s friday  and once again we re bringing you insights straight from current mba applicants and students as part of our fridays from the frontline column  our contributor this week  mit sloan school of management second year brian kirk  pictured above  second from left   knows his fair share about the frontline  both figurative and real  having served as a u s  navy submariner prior to business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the post that follows  he offers some incredible insights about humility and its impact on success  drawn both from his time at sloan and his military service  worth the read  kirk and other leaders of the mit sloan veterans association just hosted veteran s ambassadors day  a day of programming and activities for prospective mba applicants from the armed forces  they are planning a second ambassadors day in the spring  so if you are an active duty service person or veteran considering business school  check it out  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we welcome the contributions of other current mba students and applicants  as well as alumni  please email jeanette or marianne if you would like to add your voice to the mix  many thanks to brian kirk for this week s inspiring post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from mit sloan s mba student blogs page  which features contributions from its full time mba students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> humility leads to clarity  humility leads to an open mind and a forgiving heart  with an open mind and forgiving heart  i see every person as a superior to me in some way  with every person as my teacher  i grow in wisdom  as i grow in wisdom  humility becomes more my guide  i begin with humility  i act with humility  i end with humility     eric greitens  author  former u s  navy seal</paragraph>
    <paragraph>after a wonderful first year at mit sloan and an interesting internship in management consulting  i am  without a doubt  ready to roll up my sleeves and dig into year two of my mba  as soon as i stepped back on campus  my heart soared  i couldn t control it  i was just excited to be back  mit sloan has become such a special place to me  one where the sky is the limit  where everyone wants to impact others and the environment in meaningful  insightful and transcendental ways  and eternal optimism is not just a mantra  but a way of life  i breathe a little easier when i m around other sloanies  i smile a little more and i sigh a little less </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i recently had the distinct privilege to be a  pilot  a structured mentor for a group of first year mba students during their mit sloan orientation  i was asked to share my insights on how to best succeed during the first semester as they learn to operate as a team and provide recommendations for how they might best flourish as individuals and a collective </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but how do you quantify the  secret sauce  that makes mit sloan so unique  what actionable advice could i offer my classmates that would help them through the semester  reflecting on my experiences as a u s  navy submariner  my summer internship and my time at sloan  i realized that  at its core  the defining characteristic of mit sloan and every other successful team that i have ever led or worked with is humility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>humility is at the core of sloan culture  when asked to describe the student body   humble  is often the first word my classmates offer  i couldn t agree more  every day in the classroom  i am surrounded by incredible young people who have all positively and irreversibly changed organizations for the better  yet there is never an air of pretentiousness or a feeling of entitlement  my peers share their stories and insights so that everyone can benefit from their experience and invite others to challenge their ideas to everyone s benefit  everybody recognizes that the most meaningful part of our mba education is learning from one another  and to do so  i believe we approach every conversation  case study and coffee chat with an unrivaled sense of humility </paragraph>

  <title>  average gmat up  percentage of women  minorities  international students down at stanford gsb</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  this week released its class of      profile  revealing the highest average gmat score     of all leading business schools  it s just a one point gain over last year for the palo alto school  but enough nonetheless to stay in front of the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  where the average this year was      the average undergraduate gpa for the incoming class at stanford gsb also was a record setter at      perhaps part of what led the admissions committee to add that component to its publicly shared profile statistics for the first time this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as it does each year  the school noted that especially given its smaller class size   even two students can  and do  create  variations in percentages in the overall profile  this year  those variations included dips in the percentage of women     percent this year  down from    percent last year   minorities     percent  down from     and international students     percent  down from     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this comes in a year when the percentage of female students at many other leading mba programs grew significantly with kellogg s northwestern school of management  dartmouth s tuck school and the university of chicago booth school of business all reporting record female enrollment </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we admit person by person  not category by category   reads stanford s website   there are no quotas or targets in the stanford admission process  and we assess each applicant based on her or his own merit  this is why we consider a class profile illustrative  rather than informative  in truth  there is no statistic that can capture an individual s potential  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there were also shifts in industry representation among the incoming class at stanford  most notably  students coming from consulting dropped to    percent of the class  down from    percent  those from financial services also dipped  to just   percent this year  down from    percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more incoming students with pe vc  tech backgrounds meanwhile  the percentage of incoming students who worked in private equity and venture capital prior to stanford grew slightly  to represent    percent of this year s class compared to    percent last year  those coming from the technology sector also increased  up two percentage points  to    percent   as did those from manufacturing    percent compared to last year s   percent   stanford noted that it adjusted some industry categories this year to better reflect students  backgrounds  giving military and real estate each its own category for the first time and merging consumer products and services with healthcare </paragraph>
    <paragraph>median work experience stayed steady at   years  as it has been for the past several incoming classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>application volume up those who gained acceptance to stanford for this year should be especially proud  since the total number of applicants reached an all time high of        that s up     percent over last year s        class size remained roughly flat      this year  compared to last year s       meaning that the most selective mba program in the world was likely even harder to get into last year than in prior years   stanford did not disclose official selectivity rates   stanford has enjoyed steady application volume growth in recent years  there were      percent more applicants this year than in       when       hopefuls hit submit </paragraph>

  <title>cambridge judge appoints first ever female director of the mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as mba students arrived on campus at cambridge university s judge school of business  cjbs  last month  a new academic director stood ready to greet them  jane davies  an expert in operations management and process excellence  was appointed in august to serve as the first ever female director of the mba program at judge  her appointment nicely coincides with the school s launch of a women s leadership initiative  wli  earlier in the year  new scholarships for females in partnership with the     club  sponsorship of a new women entrepreneur of the year award and a continued focus on gender diversity related research by faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while new to the role of academic director  davies is far from new to judge  since       she has taught operations management including the school s core course on operations and she has twice won the cjbs teaching award as the highest rated mba lecturer by students  in both      and      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>speaking to clear admit just before students were scheduled to arrive on campus last month  davies modestly downplayed how much her students seem to love her   i don t know about being loved   she says with a laugh   but i do take an interest in the students   this means getting to know them on a first name basis and understanding their backgrounds and inspirations  even across large core lecture classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my new role will give me more of an opportunity to get to know them in greater depth and across the full academic year   she says with clear excitement  as academic director  she will also be focused on ensuring the continuing high quality of the entire mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i will be working to give students the best possible program and experience they can have  making sure we are academically rigorous  making sure the program is relevant and developing the program further on the practical side to give students critical real world experience   she says  she doesn t worry about missing the role of lecturer  though  since she ll also continue to teach both her core classes and electives </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i know what it s like to switch careers  asked about any specific insights and priorities she brings as the first female director  davies says she views her contributions as regardless of gender   i previously worked in the consulting sector  i undertook an mba myself  i know what it s like to switch careers   she says  some might even call her a career pivot expert  she began as a management consultant  returned to earn her mba  worked in finance at fidelity and then obtained her doctorate and transitioned once again to academia </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this experience positions her well to help meet the needs of judge mbas     percent of whom switched jobs or industry or countries last year  and    percent of whom switched all three  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but it s her operations expertise that perhaps will serve her most in this new role  she says   i am used to getting stuff done  i focus on delivery and outcomes  i am really concentrated on the quality of service we deliver and i value and act on feedback   her operations background also means she is always looking for continuing improvement   we are always looking for how we can expand what we offer students  </paragraph>

  <title>choosing between the gre and gmat</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as you begin to explore an mba education  the question of whether to take the gre or gmat may soon arise  while the gmat has traditionally been the test that mba applicants take  more and more top graduate business programs are starting to accept the gre as well  ultimately  accepting both tests gives the schools a larger pool of applicants  allowing them to be more selective in terms of which students they accept into their programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a good first step in deciding which test or tests to take is to determine which scores your target schools accept  some schools will only accept the gmat  in which case your choice is made for you  when it comes to schools that accept either gmat or gre scores  there are several considerations you should take into account when choosing between the two  ranging from the differences between the tests themselves to the different ways admissions committees may interpret your choice of test  to help you make an informed decision  we ve provided a breakdown of the different tests  various sections and consulted with an admissions professional for some industry insights </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you feel completely lost  a good place to start is to take a both a gre and gmat practice test to see which one you prefer  both practice tests are freely available and easy to find online   gmac offers free software that includes two practice gmat tests  ets has a similar offer for the gre   while the tests measure similar knowledge and skill sets  there are significant differences between the two </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how the two tests stack up in terms of general structure  the gre consists of a    minute analytical writing section  which includes two essays that applicants have    minutes each to complete  an additional verbal reasoning section also features two    minute sections  another two sections are devoted to quantitative reasoning  each with a    minute time allotment for completion  finally  there is a     to    minute experimental section that can be either math or verbal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gmat  meanwhile  consists of one    minute analytic section with one essay  a    minute integrated reasoning section  a    minute quantitative section and a    minute verbal section </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of how the tests are administered  the gre and gmat are quite similar  both are taken on computers  and applicants have roughly three and a half hours to complete each test  the tests are also both adaptive  but in slightly different ways  for the gre  how a test taker performs on the first section of the math and verbal sections will determine the difficulty of the second section  for the gmat  questions grow continuously more difficult the more questions a test taker gets right </paragraph>
    <paragraph>where quantitative skills are concerned  both tests contain questions involving arithmetic  algebra  geometry and data analysis  pretty much anything you learned before trigonometry is fair game  that said  the ways in which these concepts are presented to test takers varies from one test to the other  the gre questions involve  number sense  looking at two figures  manipulating them and comparing their values  the gmat  in contrast  features mostly step by step word problems  some test takers will be tempted to choose between the tests based on the math section alone  since one format may be more comfortable and familiar than the other  most agree that the gre s math portion tends to be a little bit easier  so you should keep this in mind when comparing scores </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as far as the verbal section goes  the gre places a much higher emphasis on recalling vocabulary words than the gmat does  in turn  the gmat prioritizes grammar  logic and reasoning in its verbal section  both tests feature reading comprehension questions where you read a passage and answer questions about it afterwards  the gre also has text completion questions  where you choose a word to fill in the blank  as well as sentence equivalence questions  where you choose two words to fill in the blank space in a sentence so that the sentence has the same meaning no matter which word you use  the gmat  for its part  requires test takers to correct the grammar of a sentence as well as analyze the logic of an argument  this is another difference between the tests that may make one more appealing than the other to an individual test taker   students who excel at grammar may not have the best vocabulary and vice versa  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gre gives you a score based on your essay        your verbal section           and your math section            the gmat gives you a score based on your essay        an integrated reasoning subscore        a math subscore         a verbal subscore         and a total score           based on your verbal and math subscores  because the metrics vary considerably  the best way to find out the score you should be aiming for is to simply call the admissions office at the schools of your choice and ask </paragraph>

  <title>cambridge judge sees seven point jump in female mba enrollment</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>more women than ever    percent make up the newest mba class at cambridge s judge school of business  cjbs   which arrived on campus last week   while most schools have also seen an increase in the percentage of women students  this is a big jump for us  last year we were at    percent with a smaller class    wrote admissions director conrad chua on the cambridge mba admissions blog yesterday  chua attributed the growth in female mba enrollment in part to successful outreach by the school s marketing team </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the incoming class has     students  an increase over last year s      jane davies  who was appointed this year as the school s new director of the mba  called it  restrained growth  in a recent interview with clear admit  adding that the school does not want to compromise on quality at all by increasing the number of students  the faculty  too  has grown in size over the past few years  she noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with its one year mba program  there s a lot for students to accomplish at judge between enrollment and graduation  in his blog post  chua noted that recruiting started even earlier than usual this year  students  first eight days on campus included two employer events whereas in past years employers didn t come until the third week  he wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph> no one had a perfect application  chua went on to recount the words he d shared with a prior entering class  reminding this year s new students to make the most of their time at judge and brace for inevitable setbacks along the way   no one had a perfect application so ultimately  each student was sitting in lt  because the admissions committee and faculty interviewers had seen some potential in them  and taken a risk that this potential could be developed in cambridge so that they will become students and subsequently alumni who could build on the school s legacy   he wrote  recognizing their own potential its what will help students bounce back from any setbacks they encounter  he continued  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stay tuned for our exclusive interview with jane davies  judge s first ever female director of the mba  </paragraph>

  <title>how work experience helps open mba doors</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with so many factors to consider when approaching business school  some candidates may not be fully prepared to address the question of work experience  sure  gmat scores and gpas are key  but what s so important about a resume  applying to business school isn t the same as applying for a job  or is it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to katelyn stephenson  assistant dean for admissions at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  the two are more similar than we might think  that s because admission committees often assess both the quantity and quality of an applicant s work experience in some of the same ways that a post mba employer would </paragraph>
    <paragraph> along with their applications and resumes  our admissions committee will review candidates  professional goals as articulated through their written essays and personal interview   explains stephenson   we re trying to assess how focused they are professionally  what resources they may need for successful job placement post mba and what insight they can add to the classroom discussions based on their experiences  our duty is partly about crafting a diverse and competitive mba class  but it s also about setting students up for success and helping them get to where they want to go professionally  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> employers want to see focused  motivated  ambitious people   she says   they are looking for evidence of leadership potential  and work experience is one indication of that  even if candidates have the same academic credentials their professional background is one way to really differentiate themselves  additionally  depending on the industry  some employers also look to recruit candidates that already had four to six years of work experience prior to starting business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an mba seeker also may wonder how his or her unique undergraduate and professional background factors into the admissions process  especially if they don t happen to be in a business related field  stephenson assures prospective students that georgetown mcdonough  like many highly selective business schools  looks for diverse candidates with a balance of clearly defined goals and the ability to achieve them </paragraph>

  <title>mba application volume up around the globe  according to latest gmac survey</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>at the annual graduate management admission council  gmac  conference in denver this past june  the admissions directors we talked to from leading business schools were almost giddy  it was still early in the cycle  but application volume had been high and applicants had been strong making preliminary profiles for the class of      look very exciting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as students have come to campus and schools have shared their actual class of      profiles  the cause of that excitement has become clear  the average gmat score for this year s first year students at northwestern s kellogg school of management jumped from     last year to an all time high of      at wharton  the mean score for the incoming class this year is      up from last year s record setting      at harvard business school  hbs  the median gmat score rose from     last year to     this year   hbs does not publish mean gmat scores  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today  gmac  which owns and administers the gmat  released figures from its      application trends survey   revealing that the giddiness at last june s conference was warranted mba application volume was indeed up around the globe  with a majority of full time mba programs reporting an uptick in applicants  gmac consulted     graduate business programs at     universities worldwide to arrive at its findings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among full time two year mba programs     percent reported an increase in application volume this year  gmac reports  full time one year programs had a good year  too     percent saw the number of applicants increase year over year  up from just    percent that reported growth last year  compared to    years ago     percent of full time two year mba programs and    percent of full time one year mba programs report that they received more applications this year than in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is positive news and reflects a strong full time mba market   said bob alig  gmac s executive vice president for school products  in a statement   the full time mba continues to be a sought after credential because graduates consistently see a high return on their investment not only in terms of earnings  but also in job satisfaction and personal fulfillment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>female mba applications volume increases we ve definitely seen an increase in women applicants   said sara neher  admissions director of uva s darden school of business back at the gmac conference in june   everyone s talking about it   she said  referencing admission directors from other schools   i just worry that they re not real   neher said  half jokingly </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac s data bears out neher s experience  the percentage of women in mba applicant pools has increased   to   percentage points over the last five years for all but one of the program types analyzed  gmac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of full time two year mba programs     percent report more women applicants in       this was evidenced not only in the preliminary  anecdotal findings shared by neher and others in june  but also in the official news from the schools earlier this fall  kellogg triumphantly announced that women would make up    percent of its incoming class  up five percentage points over last year  wharton moved up to    percent from    last year  hbs had a two point gain over last year  to report that its incoming class is    percent women  uc berkeley s haas school  which blazed a trail last year in drawing    percent women  this year still attracted    percent and boasts more women in its overall program than ever before  tuck topped    percent women for the first time ever  darden  for its part  welcomed    percent women  a record for the school  sara neher can cast her worries aside  those women applicants appear to have been quite real </paragraph>

  <title>new podcast series distills hbs s signature case method</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we spoke with harvard business school  hbs  director dee leopold back in june  when she shared that an updated version of the inside the hbs case method video which every prospective applicant to the school is strongly encouraged to watch is in the works this year  as far as we know  it hasn t yet debuted  but in the meantime  hbs has announced the launch of a new podcast series that helps demystify the legendary pedagogy for which the school is known </paragraph>
    <paragraph>called cold call  the podcast series breaks down hbs s signature case method into twice monthly snippets that help listeners feel as if they are right there in the middle of the hbs classroom  hosted by chief marketing and communications office brian kenny  each podcast is led by an hbs professor who gives listeners back stage passes  if you will  to a case he or she has written  the podcast explores what inspired the case and why it matters in the world of management practice  added bonuses include interesting anecdotes the professor chooses to share that emerged as part of researching and then teaching the class to students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the podcast series draws its name from the way each hbs class starts with a  cold call  in which the professor picks one student  with no prior warning  to set out the facts of the case and kick off class discussion   it s a nerve wracking moment that binds hbs graduates across generations   notes the school s website  in all  harvard mbas will prepare and discuss between     and     cases during their two years at the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each episode of cold call  the podcast  will in just    to    minutes bring the lessons and research of hbs s renowned faculty straight to listeners  minus the anxiety of being called on  the series kicked of the week of september  th  just as fashion week was in full swing in new york city  not coincidentally  the inaugural case focused on fashion mogul stella mccartney and how she built a brand marrying luxury with sustainability </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cold call will feature new podcasts every two weeks  interested listeners can subscribe on itunes and itunesu or follow along on soundcloud   it should be on the playlist of prospective mba students and seasoned business practitioners alike   the school notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we know this much  dee leopold is a self professed  nut  about wanting prospective applicants to be as familiar with the hbs case method as possible before applying  seems like a smart move to spend    minutes here     minutes there familiarizing yourself with what makes hbs hbs </paragraph>

    <paragraph>given the mba is a          investment  not counting opportunity costs in lost income   at this time last year i was very curious about any specific  process  advice  and i was generally left disappointed as most of the advice i found online was the in the  feels good but useless  category   e g  find your passion  build great relationships  travel  dream  take risks  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has a lot of inherent personal bias as it is what worked for me  so please take these notes with healthy doses of salt  and  yes  this will be long and dense  but i hope you find it worthwhile </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as i outlined in the previous post  there are six priorities at business school  academics  career  extracurriculars  social  framily  close friends and family  and you  i ll go through what i ve learned as i ve approached these at school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make a plan i spent four hours during winter break going through every course that i d be interested in  after making the list  i tallied all feedback i d received about professors whose classes i should take  i went about creating a rough two year plan  i haven t stuck to it  but as always  the act of making a roadmap helped a lot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>understand historical bidding statistics we have a bidding system  so i spent time understanding the points spent on the course in question in the past and also looked at the average rating of the professor  with this data  i could easily spot the over valued and under valued courses  my takeaway   use data where possible and invest in understanding the system </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ask for recommendations early on  i asked most second years i met for top course recommendations  this helped a lot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>show up i think i missed just two classes through the year  that helped a lot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>be      present my natural add makes it difficult to keep focus throughout a class  so i worked out a simple forcing mechanism   sit in front  this helped ensure i didn t spend my time mucking around on my phone or laptop and also ensured i fed off the professor s energy  this worked most of the time  and that s what i was shooting for </paragraph>
    <paragraph>come prepared and participate this is part of the  be      present  idea  participation is an extension of that  now  i think i was far better prepared in my fall quarter than later quarters  after the first couple of weeks  i began getting a sense of the level of depth required and that helped me calibrate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>align on expectations if possible it is always helpful to have a conversation upfront if you feel there might be misalignment on goals and priorities  i can think of a couple of experiences when having this conversation would have helped </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t count group meetings as study time this is the same concept as work meetings   use this for discussion  agreement and decisions  don t count it as solo study time  bring value to a group meeting  very hard to do sometimes  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>no need to be the lead in every group continuing of the previous thread  if you find others taking the lead in some groups  let them  just make sure you do the same in another group </paragraph>
    <paragraph>think about whether you need the textbook i didn t use textbooks  but i know of people who did  so this might be true just be me  i found the course pack and readings to be more than sufficient </paragraph>
    <paragraph>attend review sessions only if absolutely necessary i went to very few  when i did  i often chose a video as you can skip through most parts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   hours i found that roughly    hours of study per course was sufficient to grasp the concepts and do well  this is roughly three hours per week  but for most people  you see spikes toward the end of the quarter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>summarize lectures   single best learning my strategy professor suggested we spend time after every class summarizing what we learnt  i d read about this technique earlier and never tried it  while i didn t strictly do it every class week  i made sure i did it every time i studied  this typically happened when an assignment was due   the assignment naturally required knowledge of what had been taught in the prior couple of weeks  so  instead of diving into the answers of the assignment  i d go back and make sure i summarized lectures first  this was an amazing move as it made it easier to make my notes to review before the exam  and in exams where we were only allowed a cheat sheet  it made the process of creating the cheat sheet really simple </paragraph>

  <title>yale som expands integrated core to include course on global teamwork</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how to effectively work on teams has long been an integral part of what many leading business schools teach their students  this year  yale school of management  som  is upping the ante by launching a new core curriculum course that will focus not only on teamwork but on global teamwork  called global virtual teams  the new course will feature research on what makes global teams succeed or fail  a requirement for all mba students in the class of      and beyond  the new core course is designed to help every yale som graduate develop skills to prepare them to work on projects with teams around the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>set to debut in january       global virtual teams was developed in part in response to challenges students shared upon returning from summer internships that involved working on global teams </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s an area where there is a fair amount of academic research into how better to work in those teams and how better to manage those teams   professor olav sorenson  director of the integrated mba curriculum at som  said in an article about the new course on the school website   our hope is that they will develop a set of skills for how to interact better with people who might be working from different cultures and different time zones  so when they go into real jobs they ll be able to drop right in and be productive from day one  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new course builds on two of yale som s greatest strengths  sorensen says  its integrated mba curriculum and its membership in the global network for advanced management  four som professors victoria brescoll  heidi brooks  michael kraus and amy wrzesniewsk will teach the course  which will take place on three consecutive days  students will then apply the skills they ve developed as part of a virtual team project in the operations engine course </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wrzesniewski  who helped design the course  notes that an experiential component was critical  as part of operations engine  students will team up with colleagues from hec paris and mexico s egade business school  both of which are part of the global network  working together they will work on a weeklong  real time operations management simulation called littlefield technologies </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the simulation will present students with some of the same challenges that they ll have when they are working in global teams in their jobs   wrzesniewsk said as part of the article on the yale website  managing a    hour process and learning how to work asynchronously is one such skill   one of the big problems global teams face is in how they hand off and coordinate information when you re not always working together in real time  you need to be sure the team has what it needs to execute without interruptions  questions or delays   wrzesniewsk continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to david bach  yale som s senior associate dean for executive mba and global programs  the development of the new course reflects the ways in which the global network has helped to spur innovation  the network  launched in      by yale som dean edward snyder  now counts    members schools in    countries across   continents </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there is a real sense of entrepreneurial initiative shared by the schools as we leverage the network to enhance the education of all of our mba students   bach said </paragraph>

  <title>new forte  rising star  pilot program preps undergrad women for business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>undergraduate women on    u s  campuses can now participate in a fun  free online program designed to help them prepare and compete for top jobs in business related fields  the new  rising star  pilot initiative  announced yesterday by the forte foundation  is designed to encourage young women of all majors to start exploring career options early to better position them for jobs in business fields immediately upon graduation  by extension  the new program could also help position women to apply to competitive mba programs after acquiring requisite work experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools participating in the  rising star  program include carnegie mellon university  cornell university  george washington university  indiana university  new york university  ohio state university  the university of michigan  the university of texas at austin  william   mary and yale university  forte handpicked the participating schools  most of which are in the consortium s business school membership already  with the goal of including a diversity of schools ranging from large public institutions to small private colleges   we went to familiar campuses where we have a strong support network for this pilot year  with the intention of expanding as soon as the pilot year is over   says forte executive director elissa sangster </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the women we have talked to post college were often behind in terms of their career plans and ambition and preparedness   says sangster   we have found that they felt pressure and were wishing they had started thinking about their careers earlier  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the  rising star  pilot was designed in response  to help women even those not in a business related field or major to explore a range of career options in business   liberal arts and engineering students often end up in business careers and mba programs  and the earlier we can start opening up doors for these women  the better   sangster says  the program expands upon the work forte has been doing for years to provide career advice and networking opportunities for post college women and women in their final college years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the web based  rising star  curriculum includes networking advice  resume building and job search support  career guidance  mba exploration and more  a total of    activities make up the program  which forte suggests the college women should allow at least two semesters to complete  along the way  participants will accrue points for successful completion of each activity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each time a student amasses     points  she earns a reward  rewards range from valuable introductions to the forte corporate and business school sponsors of the student s choosing  entry into the forte full time jobs or internships resume book  an invitation to a special networking session and application waivers for forte s c b  college to business  leadership conference or its college fast track to finance conference </paragraph>
    <paragraph>women who earn the full     points possible as part of the program will be christened a  forte rising star  a designation intended to help them stand out to potential employers  as well as to admissions committees at leading mba programs  beyond the resume enhancing title  winners will also get to choose between having a three month career prep mentor and lunching with a career influencer </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we talked a lot about gamification and what the millennial group is accustomed to   sangster says in response to how the decision to include a point and reward system came about   we wanted to make it fun  but we also wanted it to be a challenge for them and make it clear that they were working toward a goal   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the point and reward system also made it easy to  block and tackle  all of the components of the program  sangster adds   we were able to put in place something that we believe to be reasonable and achievable over the course of their time in college   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another benefit of the reward system is that it ensures that the young women are prepared to take each step along the way   not only is it fun that you get to meet with a forte corporate or business school sponsor  for example  but you will also have prepared yourself to experience that at the right level  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most exciting piece of the new pilot is gaining access to this great group of women and connecting them in turn to the forte network  sangster says  though the bulk of the curriculum is virtual providing flexibility and ease of access for women to complete it at their own pace the reward components bring the program to life and participants in contact with their peers and the larger forte program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what we are most interested in is seeing women participate in programming like the fast track to finance conference or the college to business leadership conference   sangster says  participation in these types of events will help women develop a network they would not normally have had access to that early in college </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after what sangster hopes and expects to be a successful pilot year  forte plans to expand the  rising star  program to additional college campuses  in time  to augment the virtual components  there will also be program components that take place on participating schools  campuses  she says </paragraph>

  <title>stanford dean resigns amid contentious litigation involving current  former faculty</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the dean of the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  today announced that he will resign at the end of the current academic year  just one year into his second term as dean  according to a post today in the stanford report </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i have decided that it is in the best interests of stanford and the gsb  two institutions that i love  that i step down   saloner said in an email that went out to the gsb community today  since saloner assumed his role in       the school has raised more than      million in private support  opened the new knight management center campus and adopted a new mba curriculum  among other achievements  the stanford report noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>saloner s resignation comes amid what he called a  baseless and protracted lawsuit related to a contentious divorce  between a current and former member of the gsb faculty   i have become increasingly concerned that the ongoing litigation and growing media interest will distract all of you from the important work that you are doing and unfairly impact this stellar school s deserved reputation   he wrote in his email to the gsb community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>saloner added that he planned to return to teaching and research as part of the school s faculty and was making the announcement now  at the start of stanford s academic year  to allow for a smooth transition </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is with great regret that i accept garth s resignation  which i know was a difficult decision   stanford president john l  hennessy said in a statement   it has been a very successful tenure  under his leadership  the business school has been a leader in transforming management education to address the world s economic challenges  he has expanded its international impact and he implemented an academic vision to train insightful  principled leaders who can drive global change  we are grateful to garth for his service and his many contributions as dean  and look forward to his continued contributions to teaching and research at the gsb for many years to come  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the stanford report article went on to enumerate saloner s many contributions to the school  which include launching the stanford institute for innovation in developing economies  seed  in       an initiative aimed toward employing entrepreneurship and innovation coaching to improve the lives of the poverty stricken in developing regions such as west africa  he also led the gsb      strategy process to advance several other global education programs and oversaw the school s adoption of various technical innovations in distance learning  additionally  the school has made great advances in terms of gender equity among both students and faculty with saloner as dean with women making up    percent of this year s incoming mba class and    percent of the new faculty members hired in the past two years  according to the stanford report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>against this backdrop of accolades  though  are whispers of scandal  according to accounts from poetsandquants  the litigation to which saloner referred in his email to the gsb community includes a wrongful termination suit filed by former stanford gsb professor james phills  phills  who was fired and now teaches at apple university  is in the midst of a divorce from current gsb professor deborah gruenfeld  with whom p q reports saloner was having an affair  gruenfeld  who teaches organizational behavior and co directs the executive program for women leaders at stanford  is also a board member of facebook coo sheryl sandberg s organization leanin org  started to support the advancement of women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>p q reportedly asked saloner for an interview about the charges last week  following up with a detailed list of questions to the university    saloner apparently made his decision to resign after declining a request for an interview and viewing the questions related to allegations in the lawsuit brought by phills   read a post on p q </paragraph>

  <title>does working for the family business hurt your mba potential </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>working for the family business can be an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience  building a family legacy that will last for generations is the main goal of many family businesses  and often  to achieve that goal  additional education  such as an mba  is necessary to move the company to the next level  however  it s not always easy to head into an mba program when you work for the family business and plan to continue working for the family business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>letters of recommendation  work history  application essays  and interviews can all become awkward when you suddenly mention that your experience is all connected to your family  but that shouldn t stop you from pursuing your mba  in fact  many mba applicants that come from family businesses can make their experience work to their advantage  after all  no one can be more difficult to work for than family </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we spoke with eliot ingram  ceo of clear admit  a leading source of news and information for mba applicants  to help give you a leg up on the competition  we asked him for his top pieces of advice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how would you recommend an mba candidate describe his or her experience in their family business </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the applicant needs to convince the admissions committee that they would have been just as effective at a business not run by their family   ingram says  the key to any successful mba application is the ability to sell yourself  your skills  and what you will bring to the mba program  ingram had this to say   like all applicants  an applicant working in the family business should highlight examples of their leadership and accomplishments at work  this way they can show that they are adding value to the organization  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition  you should focus on highlighting how working for the family business provided you more opportunities and challenges than you could have achieved anywhere else  after all  it s not easy working for the family business  there s a far greater degree of pressure  and the best thing you can do as an mba applicant is to focus on your areas of growth and value </paragraph>
    <paragraph>things to consider </paragraph>
    <paragraph>who should applicants ask for a letter of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even if your direct supervisor is a family member  do not ask your family member for a recommendation  although your family would probably give you a glowing recommendation  they are not the appropriate individuals to contact  unfortunately  letters of recommendation can be difficult when your parents are the ones running the company  but there are still other options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ingram recommends finding a non family member to write your recommendation letter  choose someone who knows and likes you who can and will write a good letter that focuses on your abilities  in particular  you can ask </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if your family business is completely run by family members  then it s best to ask for letters of recommendation outside of the business  you can ask a friend or mentor who successfully attended and graduated from a well known mba program  or  if you volunteer for organizations or hold a leadership position in a club or church  ask fellow leaders or supervisors in those positions for a letter of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>are there certain mba programs well suited to applicants coming from and returning to family businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many mba programs have resources that cater to family run businesses  you re not alone in your position  the key is to find the programs that best suit your needs and desires  babson college has a family entrepreneurship  growing the family business across generations program that runs for a few days and can help you figure out the best way to promote your position within your family business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for mba programs  columbia business school  cbs   a part of columbia university  offers the j term experience  j term is a great program for applicants from family businesses who need to get their degree in just    months  in fact  this program is an excellent option for anyone who is looking to graduate with his or her mba in less time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when it comes to your application  whether you work for your family business or the corporate world  the rules are the same  always focus on your qualities of leadership and business acumen when talking about your work experience  every mba program wants to know what you bring to the table above and beyond other applicants and how you will use the mba program to better yourself and business position  if you can answer those questions  it doesn t matter if mom and dad are your bosses  you re an exceptional candidate </paragraph>

  <title>should i apply in round   or round   to my top choice school </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this is the second in a two part series on mba application strategy  in case you missed the first  check it out here </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of application strategy  one of the biggest questions prospective mba applicants wrestle with is whether to apply in round   or round   to the school they most want to attend  as you might imagine  based on our years of advising applicants to top tier business schools  clear admit has some thoughts on the matter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  if you are an outstanding candidate and have had adequate time to prepare your candidacy  then you should apply as part of the first round to your top choice school  if you are a strong candidate  but perhaps are not in the top echelon or would benefit from a little more time and experience in the application process  consider delaying your application to your top choice school until round    in the meantime  apply to a couple of other schools  that you would attend if not admitted to your top choice  in round   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the reason for this is simple   explains eliot ingram  clear admit co founder   there is a learning curve involved in the application process  and your first application is rarely your best application  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>no material difference between round   and   for some candidates as many an admissions officer will tell you  there is really no material difference in terms of admissions whether a candidate applies in round   or round    unless the candidate is from an over represented group </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you are from an over  represented group  then there are advantages to applying in round   assuming you are confident in your ability to produce a superb application early in the application process  over  represented groups are typically male candidates who are either from india or china or work within common feeder industries or organizations for the mba pipeline  consulting  banking  large corporations  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is not to suggest that admissions committees discriminate against these candidates  but they are charged with building a diversified class  which means they cannot afford to have one particular group over represented in the classroom </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you are part of one of these over represented groups  by applying in round    you will know that the admissions committee is starting from zero in terms of choosing applicants from your demographic </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for candidates who do not hail from an over  represented group  spreading applications over the first two rounds probably makes best sense from a time management standpoint </paragraph>
    <paragraph>assessing the relative advantages deciding which schools to apply to in which rounds requires careful evaluation of the relative advantages of each option  there are advantages to applying to your top school first  ingram points out   if you are admitted in round   to your first choice school  then there is often no need to submit applications in round     he says  this assumes that the round   programs in question will notify with an admissions decision before the round   application deadline  which is typically the case </paragraph>
    <paragraph> of course  getting an early acceptance to your top choice school in round   may also give you the confidence to apply to schools you hadn t considered before in round     ingram adds  in this case  applying to a top school as part of the first round may inspire you to extend your list of  reach schools  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> either way  getting an admissions decision from your top school as part of round   can reduce cost and uncertainty in the application process   ingram says  it can also simplify the decisions involved with beginning the mba program and help applicants get on track earlier for student visa  scholarship and financial aid considerations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the other hand  there are also advantages to applying to a candidate s top school later   if a candidate waits until round   to apply to her top school  then the experience of applying in round   should sharpen the application for the top school  increasing the chances of admission at the top school   ingram points out </paragraph>

  <title>how to live a good life takes center stage during kellogg orientation</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>before diving into the fray of finance  accounting  operations and marketing  every incoming first year student at northwestern s kellogg school of management first spent an afternoon grappling with the question of how to live a good life </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what do i value    how do i find my personal mission    how do i create an action plan to live a life consistent with this mission   these considerations not how to cut costs  gain market share or increase profits were part of a new element introduced this year during kellogg s complete immersion in management  cim  week  the stretch of days before classes start when incoming students meet each other and the school for the first time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>coined the  good life afternoon   this newest element of kellogg s orientation grew out of a student led initiative launched last spring called the  good life sessions   the brainchild of kellogg students rohan rajiv      kellogg  and lexie smith      kellogg   last year s series of workshops and this year s orientation exercise were both designed to help students create a game plan for leading fulfilling  balanced lives in tandem with successful careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>get this right or forget getting the other things right</paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is stuff that i believe is incredibly important and if we don t get right there is almost no point in getting all the other things right   rajiv explains  a self professed  work life balance geek   rajiv spent much of his   s thinking about and researching happiness and balance  including maintaining a personal blog called  a learning a day   where he shares his thoughts on the topic </paragraph>
    <paragraph>smith  not so much   pretty much all throughout my   s i was in some really fantastic jobs  but they were incredibly challenging and i was working really long hours    to    hours a week and traveling a lot   she says  she spent a few years after college in a financial management program at ge that involved rotating departments every six months  she went into private equity after that  the first woman ever hired by her firm   it was a really interesting experience for me  but it meant that i didn t make time for anything else  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the two met when rajiv visited kellogg for an admitted students  weekend and immediately hit it off  so much so that rajiv signed up for a kwest trip smith was leading in the galapagos islands before school started last fall  it was on that trip that the idea for the good life sessions began to take hold </paragraph>
    <paragraph>two students with similarities and differences  i loved his energy   smith recalls of meeting rajiv   i loved how balanced and settled he seemed when i talked to him   both came from low income homes and were raised by single parents  albeit in different parts of the world   rajiv grew up in india and went to school in singapore  whereas smith s childhood included stints in florida  texas  illinois  virginia and ohio as her mom did everything from loading ups trucks in the morning to waitressing at night to provide for her and her two brothers  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> he spent most of his   s studying how to have a better life   says smith  who rajiv says has become like a big sister to him   i was so attracted to that about him  and i was really craving to figure it out for myself but was still very much struggling to do so  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we came to the conclusion that i probably wasn t the only crazy person at kellogg  and maybe there were a few other people out there who would like to learn how to live a better life as well   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in consultation with kellogg clinical associate professor of innovation   entrepreneurship carter cast  mba      who led marketing at pepsico and blue nile before serving as ceo of walmart com rajiv and smith put together an outline for what the good life sessions would look like and recruited three additional faculty members to take part  clinical professor of strategy harry kraemer      adjunct lecturer of leadership coaching kevin murnane and clinical assistant professor of leadership and director of mba leadership development paul corona </paragraph>

  <title>how to make sure your job enhances your mba application</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba candidates most often apply to business school because they are seeking more rapid career advancement  or they want to dramatically change their career path  however  for many full time mba candidates  job dissatisfaction is just as likely a reason otherwise they wouldn t be applying for an mba  but no matter the reason behind the mba  every applicant should remember that their application is a chance to sell their skills and demonstrate the value that they will add to the program  to do this  it s important to learn how to spin your work experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we reached out to julie r  barefoot  the associate dean of mba admissions at emory university s goizueta business school  for her advice on making the most out your job experience  here s what she had to say </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t reveal your job dissatisfaction</paragraph>
    <paragraph> mba applicants need to remember that admissions officers will not know that the candidate doesn t like their job unless the candidate tells them   barefoot said  more likely than not  during your interview or application essay  no school or admissions  officer is going to ask   are you happy at your job   that question is irrelevant to your mba application  your happiness in your current situation does not reveal your aptitude for the mba program  and that s what matters  in situations where you don t want to reveal certain details  remember that less is more  you are not required to tell your application committee that you have a terrible job with an incompetent boss and rude coworkers  focus on the details that would be of interest and value to your mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>focus on what your job has taught you</paragraph>
    <paragraph>no matter how difficult a situation you find yourself in at work  you should still be learning something  in fact  for many individuals learning what not to do is just as valuable as learning what to do   mba applicants should try and put a  positive spin  on their current job situation    barefoot continued   and focus on what they have learned in the job   if you currently work at a company that is disorganized and rarely achieves desired goals and benchmarks  show how you ve learned the importance of organization and follow through  if your coworkers are not team players  emphasize how harmful that was to the company and how you ve come to understand the value of teamwork to encourage creativity  idea generation and communication </paragraph>
    <paragraph>circle back to the importance of the mba program</paragraph>
    <paragraph>if after changing all your negative experiences into positive learning opportunities  you re still struggling to write an essay  bring it full circle back to the mba program  if you re truly dissatisfied with your position  barefoot recommends that you  articulate to the admissions officer how an mba will prepare you for your desired job or new career path   after all  your goal in attending an mba program is to move forward into a new path in your life  speak to the fact that an mba could provide you with the tools  information  confidence and abilities you need to successfully pursue a much more satisfying and rewarding career </paragraph>
    <paragraph>barefoot continued  saying   i would recommend that applicants focus on how their work and life experiences will be meaningful to share in the mba classroom  as well as how those capabilities  in combination with the mba degree  will make them a good fit for their desired post mba career path   when it comes straight down to it  mba programs want to know what you will bring to the program and whether  upon graduation  you will bring credibility to the program  so  if you are at a job you dislike with little opportunity for advancement  focus instead on how the mba will help you reach the next level </paragraph>
    <paragraph>find other opportunities to develop your skills</paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba programs are not solely focused on business  they are also focused on personal development  if your job does not provide you with the opportunity to develop new and desirable skills  find outside opportunities  barefoot gave us this example   if the applicant feels that they have not had the chance to demonstrate much leadership in their job  then volunteering for an organization like habitat for humanity and leading a team of volunteers would be a good idea   there are a multitude of opportunities to build your resume and improve your skill set  and many can be found outside of the office  don t underestimate the importance of having a life outside of your job  volunteer opportunities  church leadership and even hobbies can all reveal valuable insight into your mba potential </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when it comes down to it  your satisfaction or dissatisfaction with your job should not play a strong role in your mba application  no matter the position you find yourself in  there are always ways to spin your experience in a positive light  and if that seems impossible  be prepared to speak to other opportunities that demonstrate your competence and fit for your desired mba program </paragraph>

  <title>savvy mba application strategy  how many apps  which schools  when to apply</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>you ve decided the mba is the next stop on your career path  what now  the smartest applicants are those who take the time to create an informed mba application strategy a well thought out game plan that can help you obtain your goals as efficiently and effectively as possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the first challenges you ll face is school selection strategically choosing which schools to target  bearing in mind the competitive mix of those schools    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in recent years  mba applicants appear to be trending downward in terms of the total number of schools to which they apply  where applying to five to seven schools was once considered the norm  today candidates apply  on average  to between three and five  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a combination of factors could be at play here   suggests alex brown  a consultant to clear admit who spent years working in mba admissions at wharton   more information is now available about schools  so it is easier for candidates to determine which are truly target schools  rather than the more shotgun approach of yesteryear   he says   the complicated nature of the application  engaging recommenders and so forth  may also be encouraging applicants to really refine their school list before applying  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>making your list so what types of schools should make up the list a candidate ultimately applies to  while the answer will obviously depend on the individual candidate  one piece of advice applies to all   remember  only apply to schools you would be absolutely happy to attend   says brown   there is no value in applying to a school just to get an acceptance letter if it s not a school that will help you reach your goals  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with that main tenet as a guide  many candidates find it valuable to classify schools into three buckets  reach schools  realistic schools and safety schools  applying to at least one school in each of these buckets helps position a candidate to get into and ultimately attend the best possible school her candidacy will allow  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>say you apply to all safety and or realistic schools and gain admission to every school  while on the surface this appears like a successful mba application strategy  that is only true if your mix of schools included the best possible school to reach your goals   if you only apply to  realistic  schools  you will never know if you could have achieved something that you presumed was beyond your reach   brown points out  therefore  a truly successful application strategy often includes one or two rejections along with acceptances at schools where you will thrive   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the final consideration of a comprehensive mba application strategy is when to apply to your selected schools  that is  what admissions round should you target for which schools and why  more on that in an upcoming post  so stay tuned </paragraph>

  </authors>
  <title> admissions director q a  wharton s frank devecchis</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>way back in february  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school named a new director of mba admissions  aside from an immediate flurry of coverage here and elsewhere about this wharton  insider  frank devecchis stepping in  little else has been heard since  what gives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as was reported then  devecchis does know wharton intimately  he worked in the wharton mba program office for more than five years before heading over to admissions  in charge of operations and daily management of the mba program  he advised more than     students  implemented the school s innovative course match registration program and rolled out a new three week orientation for incoming students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since joining mba admissions earlier this year  he s been a hard man to get a hold of  he works closely with existing deputy vice dean of wharton mba admissions  financial aid and career services maryellen reilly lamb to oversee the entire application process  from recruitment through matriculation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> these past few months have been a blur  and the next few don t look much slower    he shared when we finally managed to catch him last week  before jetting off again to asia this week  he was kind enough to make time to answer our questions  we re glad we caught him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as you work on your wharton applications  we think you ll be glad we caught him  too  in the interview that follows  he shares some of the unique perspectives he brings to admissions from his time in the program office  his excitement about an increased focus on innovation and entrepreneurship under wharton s new dean and why his team was so happy with last year s essay that they decided to keep it exactly the same this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with wharton s round   deadline still a few weeks off september   th there s still time to catch devecchis and other members of this team at recruiting events taking place around the globe  click here for a full list of upcoming events  you can also catch a virtual mba admissions information session later today  from   to   p m   est  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what have you found most rewarding about your shift from the program office to admissions  most challenging </paragraph>
    <paragraph>frank devecchis  there is something about being there from the beginning when everything is new and everyone is in self discovery and exploration mode  in my new role  i see candidates from day one  learning about their goals  aspirations  where they want to go and what they want to become  and learning how wharton can be part of the journey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once they are admitted and become students  it is great to see our colleagues in academics  leadership  student life and career management take over and continue helping individuals grow and prepare to be extraordinary leaders  no two students or their pathways are the same  it s amazing see how all the puzzle pieces fit together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most challenging thing  jetlag  in three months i ve been to london  dubai  la  seoul  beijing  shanghai  denver and tokyo </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what unique insights do you bring to your new role as a result of other work you ve done at wharton over the years  advising students  planning orientation  implementing course match  etc   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fd  i have a deep appreciation for the uniqueness of every candidate and student  over the past few years  i have worked with students  faculty and staff to continue to develop a program that reflects and celebrates individuality and personalization  one of wharton s greatest strengths is its diverse community in professional background  experience  culture  etc  and i strive to continue this tradition  also  i can t help but see everyone as a potential student in our classroom  considering what they will bring to and get from that setting and thinking about how their personal experiences will inform their learning and enrich the academic experiences of their classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  when your new role was announced earlier this spring  your responsibilities were reported to include helping to develop strategic recruiting plans for wharton s global applicant pool  what does that look like </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fd  wharton is committed to building classes that mirror the diverse business community our students will lead  to do this  recruitment cannot follow a one size fits all model  we strive to continually innovate how we connect and develop relationships with candidates by utilizing new communications methods and strategies and technology  we bring a bit of the wharton experience to every interaction  whether in person or virtual  allowing candidates to have a first hand and personal understanding of what we have to offer </paragraph>

  <title>tuck tops forty percent women for first time ever</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>gender equity in top mba programs which seemed like a nearly impossible feat just a few short years ago is looking more and more like a wholly attainable goal  leading business school after leading business school has been proudly announcing record percentages of women in their incoming classes this past month  the latest  dartmouth s tuck school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a letter to the tuck community on tuesday  freshly minted dean matthew slaughter shared that tuck tops    percent women in its incoming class this year for the first time in the school s history  the actual figure    percent places tuck shoulder to shoulder with schools like haas  wharton  harvard  chicago booth and kellogg  all of which have    percent or more females in their incoming classes or overall mba programs this year  stanford gsb  historically among the leaders in terms of female enrollment  has yet to make public its class of      profile </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at tuck  the percentage of women jumped a whopping    percent over last year s    percent  we re checking in now to see what steps the school took to help bring about this impressive gain  and it s not the only gain the school is celebrating this year  u s  minorities also rose  from    to    percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the percentage of international students dipped slightly  slipping to    percent this year  down from    percent last year  still  those international students represent    countries from around the globe  and    of this year s students from the united states in fact are dual citizens of another country as well  slaughter pointed out  he added that    percent of the class has studied abroad     percent has worked abroad  and more than    percent speak a foreign language in some capacity   with such rich global experience even before beginning their time at tuck  it is clear that the t    class will eagerly embrace the new tuckgo program  designed to ensure that all tuck students graduate with a global mindset   he wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new required component will ensure every tuck student obtains global exposure the new tuckgo program  announced last year  is a set of immersive experiential courses that take tuck students to countries around the world  every tuck student  before graduating  must participate in at least one such course in a country that is new to them  to satisfy the tuckgo requirement  students can choose between a global insight expedition  an elective travel course led by a member of the faculty  a first year project that involves significant travel outside the u s   onsite global consulting  a second year elective in which students offer consulting to a range of worldwide clients  or an international exchange with one of tuck s partner institutions  one way or another  tuckies in the class of      should expect to see the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dean slaughter had global experience for tuckies in his sites well before he stepped into the role of dean  in       he formed the tuck center for global business and government  as part of an august      interview he said   one of the important dimensions of the current strategic review for the school is whether there should be some sort of global experience requirement   last september  when tuck announced  that precisely such a requirement would be instituted beginning this fall  slaughter said   making an immersive global experience a required part of the curriculum strengthens this commitment to ensure that every tuck student receives outstanding preparation for the global leadership that businesses are today seeking  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>academics  work experience  student age remain constant in other ways  the incoming class shares much in common with the current second year students at tuck  average gpa this year held steady at      and average gmat score actually slipped by a single point from last year s      to     this year  like last year  members of this year s incoming class come in with an average of five years  work experience  and the average age is     the range of ages of students has tightened a little  the class coming in last year ranged from    to     while this year s class members are between    and    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his address to the tuck community  slaughter thanked director of admissions dawna clarke and her team for all their hard work in assembling the incoming class  director of financial aid diane bonin and team for helping those students find a way to finance their mba and assistant dean for the mba program sally jaeger and her team for welcoming the new class with a terrific orientation week </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the      class is incredibly diverse  accomplished and poised to achieve great things both throughout their two years here and in the many years beyond   slaughter said </paragraph>

  <title>the inside scoop on the forte forums  great networking for prospective female mba applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>from atlanta to seattle and back  forte forums have been taking place around the country  giving prospective female mba applicants a terrific opportunity to connect with admissions staff from dozens of leading business schools  hear from current students and alumnae and meet fellow applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the forte forums are an annual event series put on by the forte foundation  a consortium of leading companies and business schools committed to helping launch women into fulfilling careers in business  taking place in    u s  cities as well as toronto and london  these free events kicked off on august   th and will culminate with a final event in october </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to truly understand what prospective female mba applicants can hope to gain from attending a forum  we dropped in on one ourselves late last month in boston  the cluster of professionally dressed young women in the lobby of the liberty mutual building on st  james avenue provided a preview of what we would discover upstairs  after a brief and efficient check in process  attendees were given a package of materials and welcomed into a large banquet hall  where admissions staff  current students and alumnae from leading business schools stood ready to answer their questions </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in all  there were close to    schools represented  attendance was so great that it was difficult to make your way down the aisles between the schools  tables  and prospective applicants sometimes had to patiently wait their turn to speak to representatives from their target schools  but wait patiently they did  and in turn they got to quiz admissions staff and current students from harvard business school  cornell s johnson school  nyu stern  columbia business school and countless other leading mba programs about curriculum  application essays  student life  financial aid and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>international schools  too  were solidly represented  among the mix  ie business school  hec paris and cambridge university s judge school  inquisitive young women with notepads in hand traveled from table to table introducing themselves and listening intently as admissions representatives detailed what to expect from the application process and how best to prepare </paragraph>

  <title>social media as a window to your soul  stanford gsb prof says yes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>so last week we shared some tips and cautionary tales from admissions directors at leading business schools about mba applicants and their social media presence  in a nutshell  we found that different admissions committees use social media to varying degrees as part of the mba admissions process  but a general rule of thumb is to not be an idiot  in fact  recent research out of the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  suggests that monitoring an applicant s social media behavior over the long run could actually reveal more intimate traits and core personality than face to face interviews  adcoms  take note </paragraph>
    <paragraph>assistant professor michal kosinski  who teaches organizational behavior at stanford gsb  was surprised to learn as part of research he conducted recently just how much what an individual  likes  on facebook can reveal about a person </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the thing that was most surprising to me   is that our most intimate traits can be very easily predicted from a digital footprint  and a very general one as well  such as facebook  likes    kosinki said as part of a recent interview with the stanford news service </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of findings that most surprised kosinski who holds a doctorate in psychology and whose research interests include big data  crowdsourcing and psychological assessment was that he was even able to predict whether someone s parents were divorced or not based on their facebook likes  in fact  those results seemed so improbable that he began to doubt his own methods and reran the analyses a few times   i couldn t believe that what you like on facebook could be affected by your parents  divorce  which could have happened many years earlier we re talking here about people who might be    or    years old   he told stanford news </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the marital status of your parents  your digital footprint is also predictive of many other intimate traits  kosinski found  from whether you smoke  drink or take drugs to your sexual orientation and political views </paragraph>
    <paragraph> actually  everything we tried predicting was predictable to some degree  and quite often it was pretty accurate   he said in the interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>come on you know you re curious to see if this is for real  well  you re in luck  a demo of kosinski s models is available here  www applymagicsauce com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not only were intimate traits predictable from facebook  likes   kosinski found that even broader measures related to your digital footprints can be used in predictions how many facebook friends you have  the number of your likes  how many times you log in to facebook  how often you tweet </paragraph>

  <title>haas welcomes new class with multiple week zero surprises</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>orientation week at uc berkeley s haas school of business better known as week zero was chock full of surprises for the     incoming students in the full time mba class of        for starters  while working on their very first case study on virgin america  the students got a shock when virgin america ceo david cush walked into the auditorium </paragraph>
    <paragraph>who better to learn from about the company s decision to enter the airline market  discussing the move made by virgin group founder richard branson in       cush described the decision which was based on branson s belief that airlines were poorly run and flights were too expensive  amid intense competition and despite a rocky start  the company is taking on the big airlines and adding new destination cities  he said  and has moved from the bottom quartile to the top half of airlines  students then got to quiz cush on the company s culture  how it hires  its strategy for innovation and the challenges it still faces </paragraph>
    <paragraph>additional week zero surprise guests included revolution foods co founders kristin groos richmond and kirsten saenz tobey  both      haas mba grads  tobey and richmond started their company which serves healthy meals to public school students across the united states with a network of haas supporters  among them adjunct prof  kellie mcelhaney  lecturer william rosenzweig and angel investor dick beers  who invested         after revolution foods placed first in the berkeley   haas global social venture competition   every single piece of the equation we built here at haas   richmond told the class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>investors early on told them their cost model was unsustainable  but the haas defining principle of  confidence without attitude  helped them stay the course despite doubts  richmond said  today  revolution foods has raised more than      million and served more than a million healthy meals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas dean lyons   we co own this school  second year students and program staff planned the packed schedule for week zero  which included a day focused on each of the haas defining principles  question the status quo  students always and beyond yourself and the aforementioned confidence without attitude  presentations by the mba program office  career management group and mba association were followed by an official welcome by haas dean rich lyons </paragraph>
    <paragraph> from here on out  we co own this school   he told the students  a nod to the high degree of student involvement that characterizes the haas mba program   it s this sense of co owning and leaning in to one another that makes us stronger  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond simply talking about the school s values  the week zero roster of events also helped bring them to life  activities such as game of teams and the cohort olympics focused on collaboration and community building  and this year  shifts in the programming were also implemented to better highlight and include the diverse haas student body which boasts    percent women and    percent international students  for example  the cohort olympics  which in the past has largely featured american sports and male referees  this year included cricket in place of football  led by a south african woman </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one morning was also devoted to volunteer service with students working to beautify a children s playground and gardens at the alameda point collective  a housing organization that serves homeless and at risk families </paragraph>
    <paragraph> week zero created such a strong foundation for my success during my first year   isabelle schuhmann  mba    and week zero co chair  said as part of an article on the haas website     i feel honored to have played a role in creating a strong introduction for the incoming class and helping to set them up for success  </paragraph>

  <title>social media in the mba admissions process  how careful should you be </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>while presidential candidate donald trump has shown that decorum on social media is not necessarily a prerequisite for running for the highest office in the land  admissions directors at leading mba programs suggest that prospective applicants might do well to show a little more caution when it comes to linkedin  facebook and twitter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>just what is the role of social media in the mba admissions process  you ask  we wondered that  too  to get a clearer picture  we checked in with some of our sources in the admissions offices at leading business schools  we discovered that different schools take different approaches when it comes to checking out a candidate s social media presence and protocols are still evolving </paragraph>
    <paragraph> social media definitely makes our lives much more interesting these days   says ut mccomb school of business director of mba admissions rodrigo malta  that said  the message he shares with applicants today is the same as it was when he started his job eight years ago  well before tweets and facebook statuses became such a part of the mainstream   we have always said that any touchpoint the applicant has with members of the mccombs community counts toward their application   he says  just as if you visited campus and were a jerk to a receptionist or sat in on a class and were disruptive  untoward behavior on social media will be noted in your file  he cautions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with social media being such a big part of our lives and with employers looking at it as well it makes sense for it to play a role in mba admissions  malta says   that s not to say we google every candidate to see what comes up or go looking for their facebook pages   he says  but if his team gets feedback from a current student or member of the staff that there s something on social media that warrants attention  they will take a look   we note anything we find in the same manner we would a personal interaction  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the university of virginia s darden school of business  googling every applicant is also not a part of the application protocol  but social media does sometimes factor in   if someone has a common name  it is not going to be worth our time to try to google you   darden director of admissions sara neher says matter of factly  but if an applicant is an entrepreneur  for example  neher may very likely check out her company website  and her team will certainly look at things on social media that applicants make a point of sharing in their applications </paragraph>

    <paragraph>as part of the      impact challenge  incoming ross first years will work together with close to    local high schools students  helping them develop business plans and products for the brand new brightmoor maker space a community workshop and incubator where ideas generated by teens and community residents will come to life  the ross mba students will also organize a maker faire and pitch competition for the teens </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the incoming ross first years will work hand in hand with detroit leaders and youth over the course of the week to launch the maker space  tomorrow  august   th  the ross mbas will organize the detroit youth maker faire  which is expected to draw       attendees from the community to watch the youth product pitch competition  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on hand will be expert judges from deloitte and general motors this year s impact challenge sponsors who will select winning products and award seed funding to the winning teams to help get their entrepreneurial efforts off the ground </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the week long impact challenge is just the beginning  though  in terms of the ross students  involvement with the brightmoor community  a group of mba and undergraduate students from the sanger leadership center will continue to work in partnership with the detroit youth and leaders for the next eight months  helping transform the maker space from concept to reality </paragraph>

  <title>hbs draws more women  adds six points to gmat median</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>when it released its preliminary class profile in june  harvard business school  hbs  was expecting its incoming class to be    percent female  a record for the school  in august  with students preparing to move in on campus  things look even better </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs draws more women than preliminary profile suggested dee leopold  hbs managing director of admissions and financial aid  posted the final class of      profile on her direct from the director blog today  revealing that women will in fact make up    percent of the class  a two point increase over last year  while this still trails kellogg and wharton each reported earlier this month that    percent of their incoming classes will be women it puts hbs ahead of last year s leader of the pack  uc berkeley s haas school  which this year slipped to    percent  from a high of    last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more significant than the difference in a single percentage point from other top schools is the vast improvement it represents at hbs  and the other schools   over the way things were not all that long ago  at hbs  women made up just    percent of the class in      and a mere    percent in       together with its peer rival top tier business schools  hbs is leading the charge toward gender parity among mba students  and we say bravo </paragraph>
    <paragraph>six point gain in median gmat score the median gmat score for the hbs class of      is     no change here from the preliminary profile released earlier this summer  it does represent a significant uptick from last year s      and it s exactly the same as wharton s recently announced median   the mean gmat score at wharton for the class of      was      hbs does not publish mean score data   with stanford  which has been a historical frontrunner in terms of median gmat scores  yet to share class profile information  wharton and hbs lead the pack in this regard so far this admissions season </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tucked away in the class profile that went out today was what may be another record breaking stat  hbs s yield which is to say the percentage of students who actually enroll after being admitted hit    percent  for many years the school has hovered around the       percent mark  at    percent   we believe this is the highest yield rate of any educational institution in the world   wrote hbs director of media and public relations jim aisner in an email </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs also reports that it was more selective this year than in previous years  accepting just    percent of the       who applied  compared to    percent of the class of      and    percent in each of the past two years  this can be linked to the fact that application volume has steadily increased over the same time period  from       in      to       this year  stanford  though  still holds the record when it comes to selectivity  with an admitted rate last year of around     percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is also a shift this year in what incoming hbs students studied as undergrads  although not quite as great as june s preliminary profile suggested  at the beginning of the summer  leopold and her team expected    percent of incoming students to have stem  science  technology  engineering or math  backgrounds  a significant jump over last year s    percent  when all was said and done meaning after some admitted students opted out and others got in off the wait list stem undergrads now make up    percent of the class  undergrads in the humanities and social sciences represent    percent of the class  a falloff from last year s    percent  economics and business majors continue to dominate  making up    percent of the class  up from    last year </paragraph>

  <title>percentage of female mba students at haas dips slightly  but total number of women in program reaches new high</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the haas school of business at uc berkeley last year made headlines when it enrolled a record setting    percent women in its incoming class  besting all other leading business schools and representing a    point gain over the year before  when female mba students at haas made up just    percent of the class  this year  haas saw a slight decline in women in its incoming class to    percent  but combined with the women in last year s class  the program as a whole now counts more total women than ever before  the school points out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  the full time mba program still hovers at almost    percent female  making it a frontrunner for top mba programs   school and student leaders say the class composition both reflects and builds on their push for gender equity   read a recent article on the haas website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas is certainly not alone in launching a concerted effort to raise the percentage of female mba students in its ranks  northwestern s kellogg school of management and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school each recently announced that their incoming classes this year would be    percent female  up from    and    percent last year  respectively  harvard business school is close on their heels  reporting in june as part of a preliminary profile for the incoming class that    percent will be female  holding steady from last year  stanford graduate school of business  which had    percent women in its incoming class last year  has not yet disclosed class profile information for this year s incoming class </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at haas  students have helped to spearhead a comprehensive gender equity initiative  gei   which takes a three pronged approach to increasing female enrollment from the perspectives of culture  academics and admissions  groups of students have broken off to tackle each of the three areas  conduct serious data analysis and suggest solutions that the school began implementing last year  says jo mackness  haas chief operating officer   they are very organized about it   she says  in fact  so much progress was made in such short order that the initiative had to be renamed  she points out   it was initially called   by   but handily surpassed its own target of reaching    percent women female mba students at haas by       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mackness was one of    business school leaders to convene at the white house earlier this summer to discuss how to address the gender imbalance among mba classes  there  she shared the progress haas has made toward gender equity and committed to a set of best practices designed to break down barriers to women both in business school and the business world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas also revealed as part of its class of      profile that the average gmat score slipped two points  to      but application volume was up     percent  increasing from       to        the school did not reveal an acceptance rate  but given the increase in applicant volume and little change in class size  the selectivity rate is likely close to last year s      percent </paragraph>

  <title>admissions director q a  julie barefoot of emory s goizueta business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>school s in session at emory s goizueta business school  just as students were beginning to stream onto the atlanta campus for both the full time and executive mba programs  associate dean of admissions julie barefoot made time to discuss all things goizueta with clear admit  we are so grateful to her </paragraph>
    <paragraph>barefoot has been at goizueta since       so if anyone knows the school  it s her  she herself holds an mba from unc s kenan flagler school of business  so she also knows mba admissions from both sides </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  the self professed foodie dishes on the atlanta restaurant scene  exciting developments in the school s management practice initiative  the opportunities available to students interested in social impact and much more  she also goes into amazing detail about the admissions process  including giving advice on how to tackle the essay questions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if goizueta is one of your target schools  this is a must read </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what change  event or development are you excited about most in the year ahead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>julie barefoot  there are a few  the first is that we hired an alumna who had been with accenture for many years lynne segall to lead our management practice effort  until recently it was led by a beloved faculty member who retired  it s great to have an alumna who has been working in a top consulting firm take the role  she will be adding a lot more resources into the experiential practice we have and will be continuing to expand it across all of our programs  it began in our full time mba program  but now all of our students will have an opportunity to work with real clients and real world problems </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lynne is adding an even deeper framework how to tackle problem solving  her approach to the semester as she teaches the course is asking students to really think about  how do you dissect a problem  how do you know which of the analytical tools you will learn here in business school to employ to address a particular business problem   she is a perfect fit for this job she is so excited about it and she has been onboard all summer gearing up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i am also excited that we are continuing to develop our entrepreneurship offerings  we will be offering a new entrepreneurship practicum course  which will give students an opportunity to work with someone in the atlanta tech village  there will be an office there where they can collaborate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and our social enterprise   goizueta program continues to evolve  here again students have another great experiential learning opportunity  one example is farmers to    a social enterprise that encourages sustainable economic development within the coffee growing communities of nicaragua  our students have helped these farmers develop a direct trade model that produces excellent coffee for consumers while returning    percent of the profit to the farmers who grow the beans  this is yet another initiative that is available to our students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>marketing analytics is a whole other area we are developing  i could go on and on </paragraph>

    <paragraph>notably  wharton did set a record itself in       when women made up      percent of its entering class  but the school then backslid a little  to    percent in      and    percent last year  it s nice to see the philadelphia school regain some ground </paragraph>

  <title>high touch outreach by current students helps boost kellogg s female enrollment</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the kellogg school of management at northwestern university is very excited about its incoming class and with good reason  a record    percent of the class of      is female a five point surge over last year making kellogg a frontrunner in a national race to increase female enrollment at business schools  indeed  kellogg s class profile was released just a day before the council of economic advisers and the council on women and girls convened representatives from dozens of leading business schools at the white house to commit to a set of best practices developed to expand opportunities for women in business school and beyond </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but kellogg s female enrollment wasn t the only statistic to surge with its newest class  kellogg s average gmat score also jumped  from     last year to an all time high of     this year  effectively countering any misplaced concerns that admissions standards with regard to academic caliber might falter as part of a business school gender drive </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we have a great incoming class   says beth tidmarsh  director of admissions for kellogg s full time mba program   we were very fortunate to have a very strong applicant pool this year  which you can see in the increase in women and the increase in average gmat score   she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tidmarsh credits the impressive gain in female enrollment at kellogg this year in part to the exceptionally strong caliber of the overall applicant pool  but other factors  too  helped entice more women than ever to pursue their mba in evanston this year  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for starters  the school made some subtle but calculated shifts in its marketing strategy in the past year   we changed some of our messaging and focus to really talk about growth and especially personal growth   she says   i have found that resonates in particular with female applicants   so everywhere from its classrooms to its marketing materials  kellogg has placed greater emphasis on discussions of growth in people  in organizations  in industries  even the essays prospective applicants were asked to write as part of the admissions process had growth at their core  inviting applicants to reflect on how they have grown in the past and how they will grow at kellogg </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i also think that women are inspired by having a female dean   tidmarsh adds  sally blount  who joined kellogg as dean in       is one of a growing number of female deans at leading business schools  strong female alumnae also help convey the message that business school is very much a place where women can not only succeed but thrive  here tidmarsh points to dupont ceo ellen kullman  mba      and ggv capital managing partner jenny lee  mba      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but perhaps the greatest key influencer in helping boost kellogg s female enrollment to    percent was the school s partnership with the women s business association  wba   which with more than     members is the largest student led group on campus   the wba has put a lot of thought into meeting with the women who come to visit and tour kellogg  and i am wondering if it hasn t actually been the efforts our students have put in that have been most influential   tidmarsh says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wba spearheads high touch relationship building activities with admitted women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rebecca sholiton  kellogg wba co president for          played an active role in reaching out to prospective applicants and admitted students this past year as part of the wba s drive to increase female enrollment at kellogg   we personally hand wrote congratulatory notes to every single woman admit   she says  leading up to that  the wba hosted admitted student brunches in san francisco  washington  dc  and nearby chicago  where admits who were still deciding where they would ultimately enroll got to know current female mba students at kellogg better </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our team met a lot of women through those events  and when it came time to write notes we found we could actually write very personal things to these admitted women   sholiton says   that was something our team really had a lot of fun doing  </paragraph>

  <title>ut mccombs launches new linkedin recommendation option for mba applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning this application season  the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin will let mba applicants use recommendations from their linkedin profiles in lieu of traditional letters submitted by recommenders directly to the school  this new option  which went live with the mccombs s         full time mba application late last week  is a first among leading business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>feedback from previous applicants and admissions consultants drove the change  says rodrigo malta  mccombs director of mba admissions   we gather input from applicants at the end of each season  and one of the main pain points we identified were letters of recommendation   he says  every school was doing it differently  requiring applicants to go to recommenders with multiple requests   aigac  the association of international graduate admissions consultants  also gave us feedback about how painful the recommendation letter process was to both applicants and recommenders  even driving some applicants to draft and submit letters on behalf of their recommenders   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another drawback to traditional letters of recommendation is that they don t add value to the applicant s own process  malta says  while they provide valuable insight to the admissions team  applicants often don t even see them   we like to think of the application process as something really introspective applicants are writing essays and thinking about their future but the recommendation letters are really just for us   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking outside of the admission process for inspiration to arrive at a better solution  malta and his team reviewed the process they use when hiring colleagues    we go out and look at people s linkedin profiles  and the recommendations they have there carry a lot of weight as we are evaluating them for a job   he says   really  the genesis was  what do we do outside of the admissions process to have a more independent view of the applicant for a job and how can we have that carry over to the application process    malta says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the just launched mccombs mba application  applicants do still have the ability to ask their recommenders to submit traditional letters of recommendation  but now they can also opt to invite them to submit a linkedin recommendation on their individual linkedin profile pages </paragraph>
    <paragraph>from an operational standpoint it s quite easy  says malta  applicants simply direct the mccombs team to their linkedin profile and tell them what recommendation to look for  and then the team goes out during the review process and reads the recommendation online  malta and his team had already taken steps to make the mccombs recommendation letters open ended  as part of implementing the linkedin recommendation option for mba applicants  they scaled back from two questions to just one  which invites recommenders to comment about the applicant s performance  potential fit with the program and other information they deem relevant </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by being part of the applicant s online profile  the linkedin recommendation becomes something useful beyond the application process  malta notes  serving to strengthen the applicant s profile in preparation for a career search while at mccombs  additionally  the public nature of a linkedin recommendation also stands to benefit the school   anything that is out in the public gives us a little more assurance that it is going to be true   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>malta doesn t expect a linkedin recommendation to become a required part of the application process anytime soon  though   having the traditional recommendation letter option remains important for those in the military who may have a high security clearance  for example  or for international applicants who don t have access to linkedin   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>giving applicants options has worked well in the past  he adds  noting the success of the mccombs application essay  which applicants can choose to respond to in writing  via a video submission or through an about me page </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the new linkedin recommendation option for mba applicants is really our attempt to make the process less painful for both applicant and recommender  give people options  get what we need and also maybe give something back to the applicant   he says </paragraph>

  <title>livewire data offers interesting insights into admissions results</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit launched its mba livewire feature in december       giving applicants unique real time insight into how their peers are faring in the admissions process at    leading mba programs around the world  perhaps most fun  livewire lets people share the good news when they are accepted to their target school  it also gives those still waiting to hear a heads up that decisions are rolling out  but more than that  seeing the self reported gmat scores and gpas of other applicants also enables those who follow livewire to benchmark their own credentials against their peers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  with almost eight months of collected data  livewire also provides a means of analyzing prior admissions cycles  in fact  we have just undertaken the first analysis of livewire responses  and the scatterplot here showcases what we ve found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before getting into what it all means  we should note that there is some restriction of range here i e  there aren t very many people reporting gmat scores below     which probably indicates some response bias  in other words  applicants who scored well on the gmat or had strong gpas may be more inclined to share their numbers publically  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with that limitation in mind  the responses we received are interesting in that gpa and gmat alone do not seem to predict admissions results </paragraph>
    <paragraph> on the one hand  the data tell us that if you have a     gpa or less and a     or less on the gmat  you are pretty much out of luck at the top schools   says clear admit co founder eliot ingram   this confirms what we have known to be true  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> but it also reveals that having a      gmat and a      gpa doesn t ensure that you will get in either   he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in short  bad numbers can keep you out  but good numbers by no means guarantee acceptance </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is actually good news for our readers   ingram points out   it means that ultimate admissions decisions have more to do with other factors within the application process essays  interviews  the overall message applicants communicate about their candidacy   he continues   all of which is still very much in their control  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>expanded livewire features for upcoming round   because livewire launched well into round   last year  most of our findings to date apply to the second and subsequent rounds  this year  in time to capture upcoming round   data  we have expanded livewire s capabilities  which should yield even greater analytic insight </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beginning this week  we have enabled applicants to share more of their admissions journey  including indicating where they have applied  as well as where they have chosen to enroll </paragraph>
    <paragraph>livewire participants can score special discounts on clear admit products an additional new field within livewire now invites any applicants who so chose to share their email addresses  while entirely optional  sharing this information will enable us to follow up with special promotional offers tailored to your target schools   share that you ve been invited to interview at chicago booth  for example  and you could receive a discount on the clear admit chicago booth interview guide  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you do elect to share your email address  rest assured that this information will not appear in the livewire feed your submissions will still appear entirely anonymous to other livewire followers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while decisions for the           admissions cycle continue to trickle in  livewire is poised to really pick up again now as we head into the           cycle  remember  your window into real time admissions results is only a click away  don t miss this opportunity to keep your finger on the pulse  of course  the more people who contribute  the better sense everyone gets of the overall admissions cycle  so don t just watch other people s results roll in share your own as well </paragraph>

    <author>Admissions Director Q&A</author>

  <title>admissions director q a  sara neher of uva s darden school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we recently caught up with sara neher  director of mba admissions at darden school of business at the university of virginia  uva   who had just returned from a family trip to celebrate her dad s   th birthday in the mountains of colorado  trading one beautiful environment for another  she s back now in charlottesville and ready to dive into the mba admissions cycle just as it begins to heat up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>neher  who celebrates her ninth anniversary as director of admissions this month  says she initially turned down an invitation to work at darden  after five years in sales at proctor   gamble including completing an mba at emory s goizueta school of business while working she returned to her home state and undergraduate alma mater to work for the jefferson scholars foundation  which offers merit based scholarship aid to exceptional undergraduates  graduate students and professors to come study and teach at uva  during that time  the foundation launched a scholarship program with darden for mba students   i met the dean everyone was speaking my mba language and they said they had a vacancy at darden in admissions   she recalls  to which she replied   no  i love my job  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a few months later  neher found she d had a change of heart  as director of the jefferson scholars undergrad scholarship program  she had worked with several classes of really accomplished  driven young students   typically  i was the only woman with an mba they had ever met   she says   they weren t seeing the mba as a path especially the women and i thought   maybe this is my chance to do something about that    fortunately for her and for darden they hadn t yet filled the position </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she concedes that change has come slower than she might have liked in terms of increasing female enrollment   it has taken me a long time to get more women in the program  but that and increasing diversity in general is something i think a lot about   she says   and i am glad to say that it has changed a great deal since i got here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  neher talks about the arrival this week of darden s new dean  what she ll miss most about departing dean bob bruner and the  surprising to some  diversity of the school s alumni network  she also describes in detail just how the application process unfolds and how best to approach the school s essay  don t miss out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what s the single most exciting development  change or event happening at darden this the coming year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sara neher  that s easy  the new dean  scott beardsley  his first official day was monday  but i had been emailing with him a lot before that  i foresee his arrival as bringing a lot of good change  we all have a lot of excitement around the network that he brings to us and his ideas and strategic vision </paragraph>
    <paragraph>scott is very different from outgoing dean bruner  for starters  he has a huge european network  one of the first things we are doing is going to europe with him  of course  he also has the mckinsey network and all the companies he has worked with through mckinsey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he is very passionate about getting the right people in the rooms  and i am excited about what he is going to bring to all sides  although what he ll bring to recruiting here at darden is most immediately evident </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for what i ll miss the most about dean bruner  i think his compassion is probably the closest word i can think of  having been at darden for as long as he had  he had such an understanding for all the staff and faculty and really tried to help them do anything they wanted to do  his approach was always   let s get in the trenches and figure out how to do this the best way possible  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he just had such compassion and understanding for others  the students could tell he cared about them  we had lunch with him just the admissions office to say goodbye  he traveled with us  he really got to know us  so the farewell lunch gave us an opportunity to tell him what we appreciated about him  and he in turn gave us some tips about how he thinks we should onboard scott </paragraph>

  <title>haas accenture partnership creates new big data curriculum</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>from financial services to retail to utilities  companies in an ever increasing range of industries are exploring and implementing big data and analytics  to equip its mbas with the tools they need to understand how data science stands to transform business  the haas school at the university of california at berkeley has forged a new partnership with global management consulting  technology and outsourcing company accenture  together  they have launched a multi phase initiative designed to position big data squarely within the haas curriculum </paragraph>
    <paragraph> today  every company is a technology company  every company is a software company  every company is a data company   says gregory la blanc  a finance and technology lecturer at haas   to be successful  our students need to know how to navigate the strategic landscape in a world filled with all this data  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la blanc has been teaching at haas for    years  including a course called data and decisions that every haas mba takes when he or she first arrives on campus   it s kind of a combination of statistics  critical thinking  inference  persuasion and quantitative reasoning all wrapped up in one   he explains  adding that it was created about five years ago as an improvement on traditional statistics </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we figured that statistics the way it is traditionally taught doesn t really get the job done   he says   it s very formula driven  mechanical  repetitive and it wasn t giving business students the ability to think clearly  make good decisions  know when to believe things  how to ask questions  how to design things and develop hypotheses  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>data and decisions tackles how to solve business problems using standard technology  sampling and experimentation   but the rise of big data allows us to do so much more   explains leblanc  indeed  understanding how to access and analyze big data whether it s complex files of    terabytes or more  massive amounts of information gathered from social networks or unstructured data such as video and voice promises to be one of the most significant transformations in business since the industrial revolution  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we wanted students to learn about these new technologies that people are using and to think very deeply about the strategic implications how do you monetize it  how do you design a business strategy around it   la blanc says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas accenture partnership is born and so this past spring  la blanc kicked off the first phase of a partnership between haas and accenture to develop a curriculum around big data  teaching a new course called data science data strategy </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the class was trying to do a lot of things   la blanc explains  for starters  it was intended to provide an introduction to data science methodologies and techniques from decision trees and logistical regression to nearest neighbor clustering  that said  the idea was not to turn the mba students into data scientists themselves   we even had everyone do things in excel because we didn t want them to have to learn a new language   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after an intro to data science fundamentals  the course s focus shifted to strategy  specifically how to develop strategy around data  and then it was time to hear from people from industry through a lecture series that included executives from dozens of companies   we had a lot of people come in from all sorts of companies ge  wells fargo  ups  facebook  cloudera  tamr and others to talk about what they think is happening in this space  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>accenture presented a perfect partner  la blanc says  noting that the consulting firm has been making inroads in data analytics work and building a practice around understanding the intersection between data science and business strategy  beyond providing a sounding board as la blanc and colleagues began to craft the curriculum for the new course  accenture also supported the lecture series  including helping secure some of the speakers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but accenture s most important contribution to the class was exposing students to what they are doing with clients  la blanc says  in april  accenture welcomed the students in the class to its san jose technology lab  where they got to see live demonstrations highlighting current analytics research and engage in in depth conversations with accenture executives </paragraph>
    <paragraph> accenture believes that the best way to demystify a typical data driven consulting engagement is to go through the process of working with clients and data scientists to achieve desired solutions and outcomes   says prith banerjee  managing director of global technology research and development at accenture   data science projects can be considered a  black box  for business managers and non technical strategists  but this exercise empowers students to feel comfortable making impactful data driven decisions and thereby help their future organizations do the same  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second new course debuts this fall as the second phase of the haas accenture partnership around big data  haas will offer another new course  applied data analytics  this fall  also developed in partnership with accenture  this course will be taught by haas lecturer dave rochlin and thomas lee  a visiting assistant professor and research scientist </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we felt like we really want to give students an opportunity to delve in deeper and do project based work   says rochlin  who also serves as executive director of haas work  a program that sends haas mba students to global firms to research business challenges   with accenture  we ve been examining how to put together a project based course that lets students work on real time  urgent  client based challenges  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the usual processing methods don t work with these data sets and the only way for mbas to really learn how to handle big data is to actually work with it  and to interact with student engineers and data scientists   la blanc says   this relationship with accenture gives students that opportunity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new course will be based on a  learning by doing  aspect that is central at haas   we are always looking at how we can create an appropriate  learn by doing  environment   rochlin says  as part of the new course  haas students will partner with students from the uc school of information  together these student teams will have access to accenture data scientists  projects and clients and will work on projects in real time with real data   they will go from trying to frame the problem to evaluating alternate ways to do the modeling  from examining what additional data needs to be obtained to how confident you can be based on the data you have   rochlin says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in particular  rochlin hopes the experience can help encourage students to take a more exploratory and diverse approach to working with big data   a current approach in using data analytics is to find extremely narrow problems and use the data to check it   he says   the next generation is figuring out how to use big data even when you don t know what question you should be asking  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the course they are devising for the fall  multiple teams will work on the same problem  la blanc says   we very much expect them to take different approaches and come up with different answers   he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas accenture partnership yields mutual benefits accenture has been interested both in finding partners they can collaborate with and learn from  but also in helping develop business school graduates who have the knowledge and skills to incorporate data analytics into their jobs and understand the value and power of that work  rochlin says   we started out talking about a very broad agenda and quickly realized there were a lot of overlaps between what they were interested in doing and what we were interested in doing   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we see a marketplace need for analytically oriented business leaders who are both able to make decisions grounded in data as well as rethink their organization s business processes to fully realize the potential of emerging analytical approaches   banerjee says  indeed  accenture has partnered not only with haas but also with the massachusetts institute of technology and other schools in the hopes of building a pipeline of potential employees with these valuable skillsets </paragraph>
    <paragraph> through this initiative  we hope participating business school students will gain the experience of working together on an interdisciplinary team that uses data  visualization and critical thinking to establish business strategy  answer data driven questions and achieve better business outcomes   banerjee continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>far from turning mbas into data scientists  la blanc hopes that the initiative will help haas students better understand where their role ends and the role of data scientists begins   too often  mba students graduate and are thrust into an engagement with a data scientist without knowing how to interact  how to ask the best questions   he says   this initiative  by providing a little bit of exposure to data analysis techniques  will give them authority to make decisions they are qualified to make   he says   exposure to data scientists in the experiential classroom will help mbas figure out their own strengths and weaknesses while learning to interact and manage teams  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the shape of big data curriculum to come beyond launching the new data analytics course this fall  la blanc and rochlin are already looking ahead toward the future of haas s big data curriculum  for starters  they plan to split the data science data strategy course into two parts   the speakers will all be split out into a separate speaker series  which will allow us to delve deeper into the data science   la blanc says  this deeper dive is facilitated in part by the fact that it is becoming increasingly easy for students to handle big data without having to learn new languages  he continues   because so many software programs today are so easy to learn just extensions of excel the students don t have to learn how to code  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rochlin  for his part  predicts that the line between poets and quants in business schools will grow increasingly blurred   some mbas come into business school and embrace the science  while others consider themselves to be more strategy focused   he says   but moving forward  that artificial division is not going to stand up  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in time  specific classes in data strategy and data science will no longer be required because they will be part of every class  la blanc predicts   ten years from now you won t be able to talk about finance marketing organizational behavior without it being evidence based finance marketing organizational behavior   he says   data will be an integral part of every course  everything will be based on data  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but for now  la blanc and rochlin  together with partners at accenture  are excited to roll out haas s new big data curriculum </paragraph>

  <title>financing your mba  part iv</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in our previous post on financing your mba  we covered loan programs for mba students from the united states  today  we ll take a look at loans through the lens of international students  who face some different restrictions but who are also eligible for special programs tailored to their unique requirements </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by law  federal loans can only be distributed to u s  citizens or permanent residents  this means that international students must put extra work into finding financial aid and loan programs to support their education if they choose to pursue a u s  mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>international students should research their own countries  options for financing studies abroad  and schools  financial aid offices are also useful resources in this regard  for instance  harvard lists    scholarship or fellowship opportunities for students of particular nationalities  this list includes financing opportunities for harvard students alone as well as universal fellowship options   mit sloan lists    scholarships or fellowships geared towards international students  and columbia business school provides an even more in depth explanation of resources  discussing both scholarship search engines for international students and country specific opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph> private lenders for international students international students can also consider u s  based private loans  but they should recognize that many of these loan programs require a u s  co signer  understanding that this can prove a hardship for those without a u s  connection  some schools offer internal options for international students  for instance  harvard business school has partnered with the harvard university employees credit union to offer private educational loans that do not require a u s  co signer  nyu stern also features a list on its website of loan providers that don t require international students to have a u s  co signer  consulting with your target schools  financial aid offices is a great way to learn about available loan options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>international students should keep in mind that u s  lenders are typically not allowed to issue loans to students from countries on the united states treasury department s office of foreign assets control  ofac  sanctions list   the treasury department encourages prospective students to check this list with some regularity  as it is frequently updated </paragraph>
    <paragraph>also addressing the need for non co signer loans  companies like prodigy finance have entered the market in recent years  founded by insead alumni who faced funding challenges themselves as international mba students  prodigy offers loans using an innovative community financed model in which alumni  institutional investors and qualified private investors fund the next generation of mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>next up in our series  we ll begin to explore the range of scholarship  fellowship and other programs providing additional means of financing your mba </paragraph>

  <title>gmac debuts interactive post mba salary estimator</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>especially given the price tag that accompanies obtaining an mba from a leading business school  it would be foolhardy for prospective applicants not to give careful consideration to the degree s return on investment  roi   this  of course  will depend on the career you pursue after graduation and the salary you are able to command in that role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>turns out you re in luck  the graduate management admission council  gmac   which administers the gmat entrance exam  has created a new tool designed to help prospective applicants estimate the salary they can expect to earn after completing their degree  prospective students enter their intended industry and job function  and the tool then parses data compiled by gmac s surveys of thousands of mba alumni to return a tailored salary estimate  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  gmac notes  the advantages of an mba extend well beyond greater earning potential   as a graduate you ll enjoy a competitive edge in the job market  meet and interact with an impressive cohort of fellow professionals  create lasting connections with your classmates  and enjoy new and challenging opportunities   reads a gmac press release announcing the new tool  still  understanding how the degree can impact your earning power is critical in terms of deciding when and whether you can afford to make the investment in business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac s annual survey of corporate recruiters  conducted from february through march       revealed encouraging results in terms of the starting salaries      mba grads were expected to fetch  recruiters at the     employers surveyed reported plans to offer recent mba grads a median starting salary of          compared with a median of         for bachelor s grads  of course  median means just that the middle number in a given sequence of numbers  and in the case of post mba salaries  that sequence of numbers might range anywhere from         a year with a non profit or in an emerging economy to          or more for select mba grads going into senior roles in private equity or venture capital  for example </paragraph>
    <paragraph>enter gmac s new post mba salary estimator  this interactive tool was designed to tap gmac s extensive data drawn from more than       alumni to help prospective mba students estimate the salary they can reasonably expect to draw based on multiple factors unique to their own situation  including target industry and job level </paragraph>
    <paragraph>simply indicate the industry and job level you hope to enter upon graduation  and the gmac tool will provide the median salary for graduates matching your selections  this information promises to be much more relevant than the median salaries for all mba grads  in addition  if you provide an email address  the tool will also serve up supporting information drawn from gmac s surveys of alumni  including   th and   th salary percentiles  levels and sources of career success  degree value  knowledge usage and personal career impact </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while it s no crystal ball as actual post graduation salaries will obviously depend on multiple factors unique to each individual the new gmac salary estimator can be a useful tool as you evaluate the impact obtaining an mba can have on your future or as you weigh different potential career transitions </paragraph>

  <title>financing your mba  part iii</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>moving right along in our multi part series on financing your mba  we ll take a look today at some of the options prospective mba students have for obtaining loans to finance their time at business school  for the purposes of this post  we will focus primarily on loan programs for u s  students  international students  stay tuned for subsequent posts that will go into greater detail about loan programs tailored for your needs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  because loans must ultimately be repaid unlike scholarship or fellowship aid deciding how much you should borrow is as important as understanding how much you can borrow  to make an informed decision about the amount of student loan debt you can take on and reasonably expect to repay  you ll need to consider your current finances and any loans or other debt you may already have  program costs  other potential sources of funding  scholarships  savings  etc   and your anticipated salary increase upon graduation  as well as estimated loan repayments and interest and fees   the department of education s website for repayment plans features a range of online calculators to help you calculate loan payments based on the amount you plan to borrow and how quickly you are able to repay  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>federal loan programs for u s  citizens and permanent residents  the most widely used loan programs are those provided through the u s  government  these specifically include the direct loan program  the direct plus loan program and the federal perkins loan program  through these programs  students can borrow the cost of attendance  as determined by the school  minus any financial aid packages they receive  in order to remain eligible for government loans  students must ensure that their total debt from subsidized and unsubsidized loans  including federal undergraduate loans  remains under          </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the direct loan program offers graduate students unsubsidized loans of up to         at an interest rate of      percent  there is an ordination fee of   percent of the loan deducted from each loan disbursement  and interest accrues throughout a student s time in school and during deferment and grace periods  while graduate students were previously able to borrow up to        with interest delayed until after graduation  the budget control act of      eliminated graduate direct subsidized loans in july      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students with good credit histories may also consider applying for a federal plus loan  the interest rate on these loans is fixed at      percent for the life of the loan  there is also a     percent ordination fee that is deducted from each loan disbursement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students with exceptional financial need  and who are matriculating at participating schools  may also apply through their school s financial aid office for a perkins loan of up to        per year at a   percent interest rate  there are no other fees associated with this loan  students should keep in mind  however  that their school determines who receives this loan  and participating schools do not necessarily reserve funds for their mba students  also  there is a         cap on how much you can borrow in total as a graduate student  which includes any amounts you may have borrowed as an undergraduate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fees and interests rates when deciding whether to take out loans  students should be sure to take the costs of fees and interest rates into account  for example  if a student borrows          in federal loans her first year  she will owe         in interest alone  as well as the principle loan  by the time she enters the workplace </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how to apply for federal loans the free application for federal student aid  fafsa  is an online form that determines the loan eligibility of u s  citizens and permanent residents  available on january  st each year  the fafsa can be submitted online or mailed in by either downloading the pdf or requesting a paper based copy  the u s  department of education recommends submitting the form online to prevent any delays in processing the application </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while deadlines for submitting the fafsa vary  most schools recommend completing the form as soon as possible in order to ensure applicants do not lose out on available funds  the fafsa does require information about income from that year s tax return for example  the      fafsa asks for information from the      tax return but applicants can use the previous year s tax return to approximate their income or use the fafsa income estimator tool  after filing their taxes  applicants can then use the irs data retrieval tool to update their fafsa  processing takes three to five days for electronically filed fafsas  schools have access to a student s completed fafsa one day after it is finished processing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>private lenders to cover the rest of their expenses  students may wish to explore private loan options through a bank or other lender  schools generally encourage students to exhaust all possible scholarship  fellowships and federal loan options before turning to alternative private loans given the typically higher interest rates these parties offer  however  applicants with excellent credit scores may be able to secure private loans that offer a better interest rate or lower ordination fee than federal loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>private loans have much stricter eligibility requirements than federal loans  lenders can decline to issue a loan  require a co signer or set higher interest rates for a number of different reasons  including a credit score  this score  which typically ranges from a  poor      to a  strong       is based on factors such as an applicant s payment history  debt ratio  types of credit and length of credit history  those with a history of late payments on credit cards or other loans  or who owe a significant amount of money compared to their credit limit  tend to have low credit scores  and these individuals may face higher interest rates on private loans as a result  in addition  applicants with little to no credit history or who are from outside the u s  may need a co signer  or someone who agrees to take on full financial responsibility for a loan should a borrower fail to pay it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while schools generally do not endorse a preferred lender  citing conflict of interest  they do sometimes list reputable lenders their students have used in the past on their financial aid websites  students can also reach out to their local banks or other lenders  or research national programs such as pnc  wells fargo  sallie mae  or discover card s mba loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>next up in our series  we ll look more closely at loan opportunities for international students  stay tuned </paragraph>

  <title>darden s dean is bullish on school s future as he prepares to depart</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we had the distinct pleasure of speaking recently with bob bruner  who for the past    years has served as dean of the darden school of business at the university of virginia  he will step down at the end of this month  when scott beardsley becomes the ninth dean of the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the wide ranging interview that follows  dean bruner reflects on his time at darden  the strengths his successor will bring in his role as darden s dean  the state of graduate management education and why he is optimistic about darden s future </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  he was thoughtful and engaging  with valuable insights for anyone considering business school  whether at darden or elsewhere  we are so grateful to him for making the time to speak with us </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what are you most proud of in your time as darden s dean </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bob bruner  the school has accomplished many great things in a short space of time  but i am most proud of darden s ability to attract stronger and stronger entering classes of students  i believe the ability of schools to recruit up is a prime measure of their vitality  our full time residential mba program has shown wonderful advancement in its caliber of students and boasts wonderful diversity in terms of industry  gender  citizenship  race  ethnicity  you name it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our students all possess very strong and rising academic potential  as well as strong leadership skills and communication skills  and what we are hearing from recruiters is the rising attraction of our students which is evident in our placement results over time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i believe that darden s ability to continue to recruit up is the start of a virtuous cycle  attracting stronger and stronger students makes it easier to attract stronger faculty  both of which lead to program innovation and a strengthening of program quality  which in turn leads to rising recognition for the school and the ability to engage a broader set of external stakeholders  this then leads to fundraising capability </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i do see in the industry the possibility of a downward spiral as well  a pernicious self reinforcing cycle  the virtuous cycle i mentioned before can move in the opposite direction  sadly  i see in our field business schools that are struggling with the ability to attract strong students and faculty or implement program innovation  there are some very good schools whose missions are quite worthy  and yet they are finding it difficult to recruit up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden  though  is in the first group  in great part this is because of our culture  we have an extremely strong teaching culture  which has led to favorable word on the street about the school   the school has been acknowledged by external sources and rankings and publications such as yours as being a place with very strong values toward the student </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a characteristic of the millennial generation is that they focus quite intentionally on value received for value given  and i think these students are paying quite keen attention to the value they will gain </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden is part of the experience economy  which is different from the commodity economy  the experience economy attracts people consumers who are interested not just in getting a thing but also in the experience that thing offers  take buying a notebook computer  for example  you can buy hardware at bottom dollar at the bare bones functionality that you need and not pay very much money  indeed  the price of computers is continuing to plummet  or  you can focus on a computer as an experience and this is where steve jobs at apple was genius  an apple goes on in brilliant colors and talks to you and prompts you intuitively to do what you need to do to boot up  that creates an experience of awe  harley davidson  disney these are also companies that have mastered the experience economy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and so it is in the world of management education  there are providers who give you the bare bones at very inexpensive rates and then there is a very small set of the total market that is the antithesis  that is oriented toward providing a total experience intended to be transformational  darden is one of the leaders in the transformational experience segment of the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba students are very  very careful shoppers  i respect them totally  they figure it out  they are able to distinguish darden from schools x  y and z  they will decide whether darden is their cup of tea or whether they want something more bare bones and undifferentiated  but there is a segment of the market that is intensely  passionately oriented toward wanting a transformational experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we get between eight and nine applicants per seat at darden  and that s because we are able to construct an entering class and deliver an experience that students rave about  that has helped us to continue to recruit up and produced a self reinforcing  virtuous cycle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what have you left undone in your time as darden s dean </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  let me just say that i am totally humbled by the experience of being a dean  there is more unfinished business  and i will be the very first to admit it  it goes to the very dynamic nature of management education  there continue to be major opportunities for darden in the areas of digital learning and field based education  getting students out of the classroom and into the field working with practicing executives   there are also still major opportunities in the field of globalization  particularly in getting american students out of the united states  there is also more to be done in terms of serving different demographic subsets of the field  pre career  mid career  advanced career stages   i could go on and on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i often hear critics of management education saying this is a moribund field a field that hasn t changed  that suffers from terrible inertia  that is a dinosaur on its way out  i will just look those people straight in the eye and tell them they are flat wrong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what i see is a group of players in the field who are investing very heavily in new curriculum  new talent  new experiences  what is not publicly known are the failures and experiences that bombed and didn t work  but we should be trying lots of little bets  we need to be experimenting widely  aggressively  broadly experimenting in little ways because that is what business does </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if we aren t failing in some regularly routine way  we aren t trying hard enough  i think my colleagues see this  there is this other notion that academics don t experiment enough  and that is just flat wrong as well  i think  experimentation  is the ticket for management education going forward </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of my favorite books right now is called little bets by peter sims  i have given copies of it far and wide to my colleagues and some of my alums  in it he describes this philosophy of investing in little ways to discover things that warrant more investigation  i have regular conversations with deans at peer schools  and they are doing much the same  it helps to hear what they are doing  there is an effervescence of innovation taking place  which ultimately makes me very optimistic about the future of the field  i think    years from now management education could well be very different from what it is today of course  it will create some winners and some losers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how confident are you in your successor  scott beardsley  what advice have you offered him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  he is a living breathing embodiment of the book little bets  scott beardsley is a    year veteran of mckinsey  and he has been the leader of internal education for mckinsey  in fact  he may very well have had something to do with the ideas embedded in the book </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my advice to him has been heavily oriented toward making the leap from business into academia on listening well and adapting to what might seem to outsiders to be an unusual environment  to outsiders  higher education can seem overly collegial and very slow moving  when in fact a lot of change is taking place but is not evident to the naked eye </paragraph>
    <paragraph>scott beardsley s great strength is in asking questions  he has impressed me greatly in his ability through a dialectical process to sort out in his own mind what needs to happen but to lead others to it in a socratic fashion  i am optimistic about his ability to make the leap into academia  but it is a stretch for anyone moving into the dean s role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what will you miss the most about being darden s dean  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i love developing people and helping to give them assignments and provide resources in ways that allow them do their best work  it is intensely fulfilling to see a high potential colleague absolutely blossom in his or her professional capabilities  shedding my responsibility as dean means shedding that opportunity somewhat  but i will continue to do that as a professor among colleagues and i will certainly mentor junior colleagues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i have been thrilled at the range of relationships one develops as dean relationships with students  alumni  donors  corporations  some have been transformational for me personally and also very fulfilling  and they have had lovely results  such as completing a major capital campaign and helping to direct the school in new ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what will you miss the least </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  travel  the middle seat of airlines   yes  i still fly economy   staying in hotels and the like  i have averaged     days per year out of town in my    years as dean  and i intend to cut way  way  way back on that </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i look forward to doing things that i have missed  i love to teach  i love to write i averaged authoring or co authoring a book a year in the years before i became dean  and i look forward to returning to that  and i very much look forward to helping students in a classroom setting again </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what will you do during your year away before you return to darden to teach </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i will spend a month in europe traveling with my wife  i owe her considerable catch up time  after that i will divide the year between harvard business school  hbs  and another school on the west coast  though the exact mix of that time remains to be finely tuned  i might spend most of the year at hbs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the purpose of going away is that it helps the new dean get traction and it helps the outbound dean reboot in terms of teaching and writing  i will spend the year developing concepts for new courses  developing some book outlines  probably even writing chapters of one or two books  in essence  i will be restarting my intellectual life as a professor </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during that year i am not going to teach  consult or give speeches i have turned down lots and lots of invitations for those things  instead i will dive deeply back into my intellectual life  but at the conclusion of the year  i very much look forward to returning to darden </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what do you see as your successor s greatest strengths </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  there is one dimension in which he really resonates with me  i will miss the ability to help develop people  and he is passionate about developing people  both students and his colleagues  i think that bodes very favorably for the future of the school  he is passionate  too  about the role of education in society and the transformational impact it can have </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he is also just a very warm individual  easy to meet  to get to know  very american  he plays guitar in a garage rock and roll band  he is a very  very highly ranked tennis player  he is keenly interested in the student experience straightforwardly  and i think these will all prove to be particular strengths to him as he comes into our community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the real core that i am talking about here is i think he s got our values  within the darden program  one of the key ideas we teach is that high performance is really driven by values  not by dollars  we are heavily a values  and mission driven community  and so is scott  so i feel very good about his stepping into this role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what has been the greatest transformation in graduate management education over the past    years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i d say it s a toss up between globalization and digital learning  both of those were highly accelerated by the global financial crisis  nobody anticipated the global financial crisis  but it accelerated a set of trends in the field that are most visible in terms of cross border mobility of students and schools  use of digital learning  the association to advance collegiate schools of business  aacsb  led a report on the globalization of management education it was really a wake up call to business schools and their deans saying   look this is not a fad  this is a long term secular trend toward increased mobility of students  faculty and programs across borders and it is going to demand adaptation among leading programs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the global financial crisis also forced business schools to reexamine their use of digital technology as a way to reach a broader public  in june       the darden school signed an agreement with coursera to offer moocs  massive open online courses   and the university of virginia followed very quickly  to date  darden has enrolled more than half a million students in coursera  and uva  another half million </paragraph>
    <paragraph>those numbers dwarf the total number of graduates of darden or uva  now  cynics always point to the fact that not all students complete moocs  but even if you only look at the completion rates  the numbers continue to dwarf the number of students on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if we are in the business of transforming society by developing responsible leaders and by doing research  the digital medium opens up vast possibilities  we have taken those experiments  grown those that were successful and offered a broader range of courses  we are doing more in our executive education programs  and we will do more in our two year residential mba program  some people do say   but darden is one of the leaders in face to face classroom teaching why are we going digital  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to them i say it is not either or  it is both and  the technology very probably will help us deliver ideas and knowledge in ways that frees up time for us to do more things that are deeply in service to our students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>going forward  we need to ask very tough minded questions about what technology will do  back in       i couldn t have guessed that globalization and technology would prove to be so disruptive  those two forces will continue to be enormously disruptive in the    years to come </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is one other phenomenon that i see playing a very serious role in the time to come  i have written about in it my blog as the  winners take all  phenomenon in higher education  basically  it says that rewards accrue asymmetrically to players in a field of competition such that the players who establish a track record of high performance tend to capture a disproportionate share of the benefits of that performance </paragraph>
    <paragraph>michael jordan stands out as one of history s greats in basketball and his financial rewards and brand value are way out of proportion to the fact that he was a member of a team that was very successful  and that team was one of a professional league of basketball players  and the benefits accrued to professional teams are themselves way out of proportion to sports teams in general </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in this blog of mine i deliver a number of graphs and tables that show that gains accrue disproportionately to high performing schools  if this continues for the next    years  we will see a widening gap between the haves and have nots much like the highly discussed income inequality gap </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  as dean of a school that seems to be on the winning side of the entire field  you wouldn t think that i would be the one to wring my hands and warn everyone about it  but i care very much about the success of higher education worldwide  and i think there is going to be a shakeout at the end of all of this that will impact business schools at the lower and middle ends of the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i see this as problematic because one size does not fit all  we have benefited from providing a wide variety of different offerings  today  a student who wants an mba at the lowest prices can find one  as can a student who wants a part time program  an executive mba  variety is what makes a market  our very broad and highly segmented market has been a good thing for students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to the extent that there is a shakeout at the middle and low end of the field  we will lose diversity  the total volume of mba applicants has plateaued and is declining  to our great fortune in america this has been offset by applicants from outside the united states  but i think the demographic trend among developed economies is not buoyant for the field in general  and the winners and losers will be even more starkly defined in the future  again  darden has been fortunate to recruit up  but if the application trends in america continue as they are  the future will be more and more painful for the have nots in the field  i would be sorry to see that happen </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  as you prepare to step down as darden s dean  what do you find to be most top of mind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  my own transition has prompted students to come and congratulate me on my retirement  but i am quick to point out that i am not retiring that i will be coming back to darden  maybe we can call it  recycling   i ve offered   no  that makes you sound like a plastic bottle   students have said   repurposed   i suggest   that makes you sound like an old piece of machinery   they reply   you are being reinvented  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i find all of this humorous  and i take it all in good spirit  but top of mind for me right now is the fact that all of us in academia and really everyone needs to think about what are the opportunities and challenges embedded in this incredible demographic transition about to take place  baby boomers are moving out of management  it will take many years for that to become manifest  but what people need to be thinking about what i find myself thinking about most is how to harness the accumulated experience of that generation  all the while continuing to invent something new </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i look at my colleagues who are of a similar age to me  and they intend to contribute very actively in whatever role they are in  i think i like the  reinvention  word best  i think there is a lovely opportunity in this generational transformation that is about to take place  i don t have any answers for what lies ahead  but my successor will have to deal with that and i look forward to helping </paragraph>

  <title>new associate dean to spearhead growing entrepreneurship at yale som</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as a reflection of the growing importance of entrepreneurship at the yale school of management  som   the director of the school s entrepreneurship initiatives has been appointed associate dean  the school announced earlier this month </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kyle jensen joined yale som last year as the inaugural shanna and eric bass     director of entrepreneurship  under his leadership  the school s program on entrepreneurship added seven new entrepreneurship courses last year  drawing students from the entire university </paragraph>
    <paragraph> even in the first year of the effort to build out the entrepreneurship program  the program has become a center of activity at the school and has engaged the rest of yale university   som dean edward snyder said as part of a story on the yale som website   kyle s leadership and the energy he brings to this new role are exemplary  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it was based in part on this success that jensen was appointed to the additional role as associate dean  snyder says  jensen s hiring last year grew out of a task force led by len baker  yc       a partner at venture capital firm sutter hill ventures  which provided recommendations for the school s strategy on entrepreneurship  houston based velite benchmark capital management managing partner eric bass  som      and his spouse  shanna bass  made a gift to endow jensen s position </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his inaugural year as director of entrepreneurship  jensen developed a variety of classes and extracurricular programs  including a survey course called  entrepreneurship and new ventures  and a practicum in which students work on their own startups  yale som also now boasts a new entrepreneurial studies suite in edward p  evans hall </paragraph>
    <paragraph>concurrent with jensen s appointment last year  yale som established two new merit based scholarships for students in each entering mba class  which are granted on the basis of demonstrated interest in entrepreneurship and future potential as an entrepreneur  yale som will also name up to five entrepreneurial fellows each year to receive two years of loan deferral after graduation to enable them to work full time on a startup </paragraph>
    <paragraph> yale  and yale som in particular  has the potential to be a real engine for innovation  and kyle has taken some big steps toward realizing that potential   baker said as part of the story on the yale som website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jensen  an entrepreneur  developer and scientist  co founded several companies before joining the yale som faculty  they include a boston based  venture backed biotechnology company called agrivida  a patent analytics provider called priorsmart  and pit rho  a motorsports analytics firm  his research interests include computational biology  intellectual property and the sociology of science </paragraph>
    <paragraph>heading entrepreneurship at yale som has been a joy thanks to the students  he says   i have a special commitment to those student entrepreneurs who chose to start ventures here and now during their brief tenure at yale   he said in the yale som article   it is a privilege to be in their service  and i am thankful for the adventure they inject into my life daily  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale features multiple resources for entrepreneurial students to pursue their ventures both inside and outside of class  jensen himself served as an entrepreneur in residence at the pan university yale entrepreneurial institute  additional support is provided through the center for engineering innovation and design  the center for biomedical and interventional technology  cbit   innovate health yale  the center for business and the environment  cbey   and the center for molecular discovery </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my colleagues in these groups are superb and they care deeply about helping yale founders build successful ventures   jensen says   that s where the real  high touch support happens  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because many students studying entrepreneurship at yale som will go on to positions at other firms before starting their own ventures  the school teaches a broad interpretation of entrepreneurship  jensen says   we teach how to be entrepreneurial  how to be innovative and how to lead others into the unknown in the pursuit of opportunity   this approach is designed to give students tools they can apply in their daily lives while also fitting into yale s liberal arts education focus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jensen s priorities in the year ahead as associate dean include expanding the use of mobile apps to enhance student participation in class  he also intends to continue taking advantage of yale som s participation in the global network for advanced management  which helps student startups with an international component find collaborators around the globe </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale som is certainly not alone among business schools in expanding its emphasis on and resources for entrepreneurship  last week  the university of michigan s ross school of business announced a     million alumni gift to support entrepreneurship at that school  of course  silicon valley schools like stanford graduate school of business and uc berkeley s haas school of business have long been at the forefront of entrepreneurship  with unique curriculum offerings as well as extensive experiential learning opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the basses  whose gift last year endowed jensen s position and helped jumpstart entrepreneurship at yale som  are thrilled with the progress they have seen   providing a structure to support student entrepreneurs is an important step for yale som   they said   we couldn t be more thrilled with the rapid growth of the program and the excitement about entrepreneurship at the school  </paragraph>

  </authors>
  <title>admissions director offers advice on kellogg s new essay questions</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we caught up with director of admissions beth tidmarsh late last week to discuss the new essay questions posted by the kellogg school of mangement on july  th  though the wording and order of the questions has changed slightly this year  applicants are asked  like last year  to respond to two required prompts and given     words in which to provide their answers  as in past years  applicants also have the opportunity to respond to an additional optional essay with no word limit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leadership and collaboration once again factor prominently into kellogg s new essay questions this year  but tidmarsh and her team hope the prompts provide applicants with a great deal of latitude in how they respond </paragraph>
    <paragraph> leadership continues to be something we are very focused on in evaluating applicants here at kellogg  but we also recognize the need to give applicants a chance to talk about leadership in different ways   tidmarsh says  her team recognizes that leadership styles vary greatly  people can be loud leaders  quiet leaders  strict leaders   we encourage applicants to take the opportunity and tell us what kind of leader they are   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we also recognize that leadership evidences itself in different ways   she continues  for some applicants  leadership may not be reflected in your job title  maybe you are a leader in a volunteer organization or as part of a smaller team at work  she offers  or maybe you demonstrate leadership in how you facilitate collaboration or take input from your team   we want to give applicants the opportunity to highlight and profile for us what they think it means to be a leader   she stresses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg is also recognized for the hands on role its students play in every aspect of the school   students are involved in our admit weekend  orientation week  revising school policies and processes so collaboration and teamwork factor prominently into our essay prompts   tidmarsh says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>together  the two essays are designed to help tidmarsh and her team assemble an incoming class that will thrive at kellogg  where leadership and student involvement are hallmarks of the mba program   it is our way of looking both for students who are going to be involved at kellogg and want to be part of that partnership and for people who are seeking to make an impact in the world and the future and be a future leader  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but she stresses once again that kellogg does not believe in a set mold for leadership   you don t have to be the class president while you re here or plan to be a ceo once you leave   she says   you can be a leader in many different ways  and that is what we are looking for applicants to demonstrate through their essays  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg seeks and brings about both personal and professional growth this year  one of kellogg s new essay questions explicitly invites applicants to reflect on both personal and professional growth in their past and in the time they might spend at kellogg  acknowledging that some people pursue the mba for purely professional reasons  while others are led to it as much by personal circumstances  tidmarsh notes that kellogg seeks and is open to both  while at kellogg  though  applicants should be prepared to grow in ways both personal and professional </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you do not come to kellogg to stay the same   she says   at kellogg  you are going to change both personally and professionally we want people who are coming here because they want to grow and change   she adds   we want you to think about and tell us about where you have been and where you think you are headed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in its prompt about leadership and teamwork  kellogg intentionally added the word  recent  to signal to applicants that they should draw from experiences in the past few years in their responses   a strong example would be something in the time horizon in which they have been working their career horizon to date   tidmarsh advises   going back into college can work for some people if the example is strong and appropriate   she continues  but experiences dating back more than that she does not think are as effective   if you are going back into high school it might lead us to wonder why you have to go back that far   she warns </paragraph>
    <paragraph>holistic application process seeks full picture of applicant like many leading business schools  kellogg s aim is for a holistic application process that evaluates the whole person  at kellogg  this goal has resulted in a long standing philosophy of granting interviews to any applicant who wants one  a practice that sets the school apart from many of its rivals   we still seek to interview everyone who applies as many as we can   tidmarsh says  to facilitate this  in addition to on campus interviews conducted by the admissions committee  alumni interviewers around the globe meet with applicants in their home countries </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in keeping with kellogg s goal of getting a full picture of its applicants  the application also features two extemporaneous video essays   we have had really good response to the video essays over the past two years and we are now going into our third year using them   tidmarsh says  she acknowledges that some applicants have heightened anxiety around this less familiar application component   but i find that once people get on the other side of it they say   oh  it wasn t really that bad at all    she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to quell some of the pre video jitters  kellogg provides guidelines to help applicants prepare for the video essay portions in advance  including advising them on what to wear  business casual dress  and where to do them  in a quiet space with good lighting   kellogg also posts    practice questions that applicants can rehearse responses to as many times as they want  jitters or not  applicants need to get the hang of video communication not only for the application but for the real world  tidmarsh points out   the world is headed in the direction of more and more video conferencing  and it is a skill for people to master and be comfortable with   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in keeping with the worldwide shift toward video communication that defies international boundaries  kellogg this year is increasing its investment in technology and webinars to make it easier for people around the globe to get to know the school before applying  tidmarsh says  still  she encourages everyone who can to visit kellogg in person   a campus visit really gives you the best sense of kellogg the best sense of how strong the faculty are  how energetic the student body is   she says   walking the halls is truly the best way to check for fit and environment and to see if this is a place you will be comfortable and excited about  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tidmarsh knows what it s like to apply to business school she herself applied to kellogg the first year the school accepted applications online  she says  but the application process has changed dramatically in the decade plus since then  she notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the biggest difference is how much applicants can learn about schools before applying   there is so much more information for people to preview and digest and consider as they are making choices   she says  for some applicants  this can prove less a blessing and more a curse   the pendulum can swing too far and people stop being themselves and start trying to repackage themselves as what they think the ideal business school candidate might look like   she says  to an admissions director  those kind of generic personas all begin to look alike  she cautions   i often say that candidates are best served by truly being themselves  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>step away from the application   my one piece of advice to applicants as they write their essays is to do some self reflection and soul searching  write a rough draft and then leave it for a while and come back to it later   says tidmarsh  too often  applicants shortchange themselves by rushing through the process   stepping away for a bit is a good way to approach the essay   she stresses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of business school overall  tidmarsh urges applicants to really do their homework  getting to know the schools  the size of their programs  their cultures and teaching methods   there is so much more to the business school experience applicants really shouldn t just look at the rankings  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of what tidmarsh is most excited about in the year ahead  it s welcoming the new kellogg class next month   when you have met these people virtually  watched their video essays  talked to them on the phone it is an exciting week when people come to campus for orientation and you meet them in the flesh   she says   of course  you barely have time to meet and greet and then it s time to start shaping next year s class  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our thanks to tidmarsh for making time to talk about kellogg s new essay questions and more </paragraph>

  <title>financing your mba  part i</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>getting into a top ranked mba program is no small feat  with application deadlines recently posted at several leading schools  many prospective applicants are laser focused now on preparing for the gmat  submitting undergraduate transcripts and crafting perfect essays  but every bit as critical as gaining acceptance to these top programs is figuring out how you ll manage financing your mba once you do </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you ve got a spare couple hundred thousand dollars in your bank account  then you can probably skip this series  for everyone else  read on  in this post and a handful to follow  we ll provide a broad overview of the various costs a typical mba student faces and the types of funding opportunities currently available  down the line  we ll take a closer look at the financial aid processes at a diverse range of leading business schools  giving you the tools you need to assess mba programs in light of both your own goals and available financing options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re just beginning to think about an mba  this series can help map out the landscape  outlining the financial aid process and resources available at various programs  you can extend your research by consulting the clear admit school guides and schools  own websites  as well as through conversations with current students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for candidates farther along in the process  the series can help you plan out your application schedule with an eye toward financial aid deadlines and  if needed  any additional essays required  wherever you are in the process  we hope this resource can help you find the funding you need </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first things first  what s an mba going to cost  the first step in financing the mba is getting a handle on how much it will cost  the primary expense of an mba program is tuition  having said that  there are a variety of other costs including living expenses  course materials and additional fees that can increase the total amount a student pays by a half again  most business schools provide a breakdown of the expenses  which are posted under the financial aid or admissions section of their websites in order to help prospective students seriously consider the cost of completing a particular mba program  schools typically take the total cost of attendance into account when calculating the financial aid package students receive </paragraph>
    <paragraph>pre matriculation costs even applying to mba programs can be costly  to start with  taking the gmat even once will cost candidates       in addition  each business school typically charges an application processing fee  which range in price yet may total       candidates can also incur hundreds or even thousands of dollars in traveling expenses when visiting schools or going to interviews  finally  applicants can take on an array of optional costs such as gmat test preparation  consulting services and supplementary coursework </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tuition tuition at the top business programs has risen steadily for decades  indeed  in the past five years alone  the average tuition at the top programs increased by more than    percent double the inflation rate over that same time period  students can now expect to pay between         and         for a single year s tuition at a top school  with an average total price tag of          for tuition alone  public universities  which discount tuition for state residents  can sometimes be more affordable  for instance  in state residents attending schools such as uc berkley s haas  ut austin s mccombs  or unc s kenan flagler pay         to         less in tuition each year than do out of state residents  this wide range of variance can be explained in part by the different levels of subsidies that public universities receive and the economies of the states in which they are located </paragraph>
    <paragraph>living costs the cost of living also forms a substantial part of a student s expenses while at business school  these costs typically cover housing  food  utilities and other personal expenses  and they can vary widely by geographic region  for example  the fuqua school of business  located in the college town of durham  north carolina  estimates that students will pay         for room and board in their first year  meanwhile  at nyu stern  located in the center of manhattan in new york city  the estimated cost for room and board is         </paragraph>
    <paragraph>living costs are usually based on surveys of the student population or estimates of local rental costs  students should keep in mind that the figures posted by most schools are for single students with no dependents  those with partners or children should take into account the additional expenses of balancing family life with full time studies  harvard business school  for instance  estimates that students with a spouse or partner should set aside an additional         in yearly expenses for a spouse or partner  another         for one child and an additional        for a second child  meanwhile  tuck  with its rural new hampshire campus  calculates that        should be set aside for each additional family member  prospective students with further questions may contact their target programs  financial aid offices in order to request information about expected family expenses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>additional expenses and fees course materials  healthcare insurance  transportation costs and other mandatory university fees can add several thousand dollars to a student s expenses each year  furthermore  extracurricular activities  particularly international trips that are often a highlight of an mba experience  can substantially increase costs  for example  the kellogg worldwide experience and service trips  kwest  range from        to just over        before considering a number of out of pocket expenses  to help cover these expenses  some schools allow students to apply for an increase to their cost of attendance and thereby take on more loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>loan interest because recent legislature has rendered federally subsidized loans unavailable for u s  citizens or permanent residents in graduate school  students relying on loans to fund their studies will see their interest accumulate while in business school  for the most part  students do not have to start paying that interest  or the principle  until several months after they graduate  federal loans and some private loans also include an ordination fee that is tacked on to each loan disbursement  we ll go into greater detail on loans in a later post in this series </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to give you a sense of what you need to plan for  we ve compiled the following costs for sample applicant  sarah </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stay tuned for future posts in this series  where we ll take a closer look at the range of financing options available to mba students including school based financial aid  private scholarships and loan programs as well as specific resources for international students </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school case method video slated for makeover</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>if you ve looked at the new essay prompt for harvard business school  hbs  this year  you may have noticed that applicants are encouraged to view a video before starting to write  if you hadn t noticed  you re welcome </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs managing director of admissions and financial aid dee leopold is passionate about applicants watching this video  which brings to life the signature hbs case method   i am a nut about that   she confesses   if i could require that applicants watch it  i would  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the case method is so central to the mba at hbs that becoming as familiar with it as you can should be a central component to evaluating whether or not you could thrive at the school  leopold believes  because hbs understands that not every applicant will be able to visit campus and attend a class for him or herself  it features the aforementioned video on its website as a means of providing a taste of what the case method is all about </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the only problem  the video is from       although three of the four professors featured are still at hbs  much has changed in the in the eight years since the video was produced  for starters  the professor who teaches the actual case at the center of the video jan rivkin has risen from mere associate professor to become the bruce v  rauner professor of business administration and senior associate dean for research  david thomas  another of the professors featured  has moved on from hbs to become dean of georgetown s mcdonough school of business  the other two professors  janice hammond and david garvin  have also become named professors in their respective departments </paragraph>
    <paragraph>career progression  of course  is to be expected  still  the case at the center of the current video  bitter competition  the holland sweetner co  vs  nutrasweet  was written in       about a competition that ensued between nutrasweet and the holland sweetener co   hsc  following hsc s entry into the aspartame market in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perhaps even more concerning to leopold  though  are the clothes people are wearing in the case method video   i want a new video just to update the fashion   she says not once  but twice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  a huge part of the reason that hbs has gotten away with not overhauling the case method video before now is that the teaching style at its core hasn t changed  in a recent interview  professor frances frei referred to it as  a learning by advocacy  model  students pour over cases on their own and discuss them passionately in learning groups all before ever reaching the classroom  in class  they need to be prepared to have a position or recommendation and to defend it with facts </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we teach people the courage to act under uncertainty   professor garvin says in the video   it s not a passive process  and frankly  management is not a passive process   echoes professor rivkin   they get to try out many of the component processes of management in the classroom  and you can build muscles around things like judgment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you are asking people to learn how to take a stand   garvin adds  a fringe benefit  students seem to really enjoy it   fun is one of the most underrated aspects of the case method   rivkin says   learning shouldn t always be difficult  learning shouldn t be painful  there is this element of joy that comes with learning  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even so  the fashion is outdated  students are taking notes on legal pads instead of laptops  and there s nary an iphone in sight  well  leopold is getting her wish  the video is slated for overhaul  this year   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>part of the challenge  she notes  is choosing a new case that will stand the test of time while also proving accessible to a mass audience  if hbs has zeroed in on a recent case to spotlight in the new video  leopold wasn t giving it up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>whether you  apply this year and watch the case method video from      or next year  when a new video is slated to be available  leopold has a singular hope   i want prospective applicants to imagine themselves in this case study   she says   because hbs is truly a     percent case method learning environment  </paragraph>

  <title>a peek is all it takes  hbs s innovative initiative to woo women</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>for priyanka krishnamoorthy  a      mt  holyoke graduate working in investment banking at bank of america  a recent weekend at harvard business school  hbs  helped set her sights on pursuing an mba  the sri lankan native majored in economics and minored in math and had been thinking about business school for a while  she originally read about peek an innovative weekend program hbs debuted last month for students from women s colleges in an article in the paper  she decided to apply after attending an information session hbs held at neighboring smith college   they pitched it really well as a way to see what hbs is like   she recalls   on campus you hear a lot about phd programs and law school  but not about business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for krishnamoorthy  the highlight of the weekend was getting to meet current hbs students and alumnae and hearing about the decisions they made both before and after business school  just a few weeks into her own first job  she found their choices really eye opening   i thought there was a set path to it  but they all said   no  you can come from anywhere    she was encouraged multiple times throughout the weekend to think of the mba more as a master s in leadership than a master s in business administration </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an introduction to hbs s distinctive case method made her even more confident that she could thrive as part of the school s mba program   it s an active learning process rather than a passive learning process   she says   the case method really mirrors the environment of a small liberal arts college   the weekend also helped her overcome her apprehension about the steep tuition associated with an hbs mba   the cost is a huge factor and i wasn t sure it was worth it  but now i definitely think it would be  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>score one for hbs  only other participants would take far more convincing  take emily london  a    year old sophomore studying middle eastern studies at barnard college in new york city  her admittedly broad plans after graduation include doing something she loves that makes the world a better place and helps people  business school was nowhere on her radar  so much so that she deleted the emails she received about peek and disregarded fliers posted on the walls at school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but the program came up yet again when she was meeting with her career counselor at barnard   he has been working with me since my freshman fall and i trust that he knows me really well  but i was really surprised that he was suggesting this program for me   she says   i don t want to say that i reluctantly applied  but i apprehensively applied  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> thank goodness i got in   she says  the weekend at hbs placed business school squarely on a list of possibilities for the future   it went from  absolutely not   to  oh  i am definitely considering that   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why is harvard wooing women  hbs admits just    percent of the thousands of applicants who clamor for a spot in its class each year  making it among the most selective mba programs in the country  so why even bother trying to convince applicants who might be on the fence or  worse still  opposed  because  like most business schools  hbs is struggling to attract women who want to pursue an mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  after some recent gains  the latest application trends survey from the graduate management admission council reveals that the proportion of women applicants to full time  two year mba programs fell slightly in       to    percent  down from    percent the year before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to even approach the gender parity enjoyed more commonly by law and medical schools  business schools first have their work cut out for them in getting more women to simply apply  leading schools have placed significant emphasis on recruiting more female applicants in recent years  efforts that have helped schools like the haas school of business at uc berkeley enroll a record    percent women this past year and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school draw    percent women for its class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs  too  has made gains  the preliminary profile for the class of      shows that    percent of the incoming hbs class will be female  up from    percent in      and    percent in       still        is the goal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>can we get the case method to cook   youngme  felix and i have been working to create the conditions for students and faculty to thrive for several years   says frances x  frei  hbs professor of service management and senior associate dean for faculty planning and recruiting   i believe this specific idea was felix s  but we all jumped at the chance   she continues  felix oberholzer gee is faculty leader of peek and the current chair of hbs s mba program  youngme moon is a professor of business administration and the senior associate dean for strategy and innovation  together the three agreed to teach a series of case studies to peek participants  choosing cases they thought might appeal to the younger crowd  in the mix were four cases  on ikea  buzzfeed  chinese e commerce giant alibaba and tessei  a company that provides cleaning services for japan s bullet trains </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we were concerned we had never done anything like this before and i just really didn t know how it would turn out   says dee leopold  hbs managing director of mba admissions and financial aid  who apologized for being somewhat guarded about peek before it took place   we just didn t know  can we get the case method to really cook  really bubble in such a short time with people who haven t done it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  initial plans were to do a small pilot with just one women s college  barnard   we thought we might get    students   says leopold  but ultimately hbs opted to open the opportunity up to students at multiple women s colleges in the united states and abroad  when the weekend rolled around      students attended from    schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students payed      to take part  although financial assistance was available to applicants who could demonstrate need  and several participants shared that their individual colleges provided scholarships covering the costs  events unfolded the moment the women arrived on friday afternoon  june   th  with a campus tour followed immediately by a head first dive into their first case </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a lost little puppy  when i walked in on that first day i was a lost little puppy   recalls catherine cousins  who will enter her senior year at mills college in california next fall  cousins  who is double majoring in french and economics with an emphasis on international markets  learned about peek while studying abroad in senegal  she has always been interested in getting an mba but wasn t sure what it would involve </paragraph>
    <paragraph> when i first walked into the classroom at hbs  there were    of us and i was so intimidated   she says  noting that with only       students in the whole school  mills  classes are tiny  but being in a larger class proved revelatory for her   i was able to sit back and listen more and observe   she said   it really let me take in all the incredible and important perspectives in the room that i might not otherwise have considered  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>oberholzer gee kicked things off with a case study on alibaba on friday evening  perhaps recognizing that the students might be jittery just starting out  he led with an ice breaker   he asked us a few simple questions and had us write our answers on big pieces of paper and show them to the rest of the class   remembers london   it made me realize that there were lots of people there just like me  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the questions he posed were  on a scale of   to     how much do you know about business    what is your first impression of harvard business school   and  what is your hidden talent   hidden talents in the room ranged from tap dancing to netflix binging to being able to force a smile in any situation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>case method wins converts  i immediately fell in love with the case method it was a huge part of the great experience i had there   says cousins   i just assumed  based on my economics background that it would be really quant heavy  i was expecting numbers and statistics and excel  but the case method was so much more than just how the numbers change   she says  indeed  professors oberholzer gee  moon and frei led students through nuanced discussions of why and how companies succeeded or failed  what mistakes executives made and more   it was so refreshing to realize that business school  at least at hbs  isn t just about numbers and math   cousins says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cindy coffee  an architecture student going into her senior year at wellesley  felt wary heading into the first case as well   when we finished with it  i thought to myself   this is something i have been intimidated by  but it s not at all what i imagined it to be    remembers the ghanaian native   you are having a productive conversation with the professor and your cohort  trying to figure out what the company should do and eventually  at the end  what the company did do  it was eye opening to be taught in such an environment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold and the professors were just as wowed by the students as the students were by the case method   the women were really surprised by how they were really right in it from the start   leopold says   it was a very emotional feeling for us to see that   contrary to any concerns at the outset  the case method did most definitely cook and bubble despite the constraints of time  even with an audience completely unfamiliar with it   if it works for them  it will work for other populations as well   leopold notes  adding that potential audiences for similar programs could include college students studying stem  science  technology  engineering and math  or people from family businesses  for example </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beating business school students at their own game in one case in particular  the young women who participated in peek actually arrived at the optimal solution to the problem at hand faster than many of the business school students who have confronted the case before them  frei says she chose tessei because it s a case with a really hard problem turning around a very ailing system  essentially  workers had a very short period of time in which to clean the trains when they stopped in the station and they weren t being as productive as they needed to be   i hoped the students would have interesting solutions   frei says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the whole class came to the conclusion that it was important to empower the workers and romanticize their work kind of like a pit crew for racing cars  i think as a class we were pretty sure that was the right decision to make   london says   frances was absolutely in shock at how quickly we had come to that conclusion   she remembers   she kept calling it our faith in humanity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i was blown away by how engaged and thoughtful they were   frei says  in fact  she even tried to steer them away from their proposed solution initially   there are times when a student gets the right answer  but when pressed they back off of their conviction   we are a  learning by advocacy  model  and i wanted to see how strongly they would advocate their positions   when she s taught the case to more seasoned executives  they often propose firing all the workers right off the bat  or they ask for more resources or more time   it was as if this didn t occur to the students at peek   she says   instead they were most adamant about changing the culture changing the nobility of the job  which was to clean trains  and they felt they could do this quite quickly  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  that s just what tessei management did  and it resulted in an amazing turnaround for the company  london reports with evident pride </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dee leopold as dorm mother many anxious applicants to hbs view dee leopold as the school s formidable gatekeeper  but the impression peek participants got couldn t have been more the opposite  the women were split between three hbs dorms gallitin  hamilton and chase and leopold herself served as dorm mother of the latter </paragraph>
    <paragraph> dee is so kind and unassuming  when i learned that she headed admissions i didn t believe it   london says with a laugh    that s really you    she asked leopold incredulously </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i ve never had an experience like that before   leopold says  ostensibly  her role was to provide parental like oversight to this group of minors  although she added that she certainly didn t find herself breaking up parties or policing bad behavior   they all want to make a difference in the world and find something that has meaning for them   she shares </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the end of each day  they would return to the dorms  exchange their business casual garb for something more relaxed  and kick back   we were in these beautiful harvard rooms in comfy chairs it was a nice way to unwind and reflect after a long  long day   london recounts </paragraph>
    <paragraph> each evening we would debrief with dee about what she saw and how she saw us interact with the case method   recalls krishnamoorthy   on the first night she gave us guidance on how to be involved in the case method the next day when you should put your hand up  don t apologize   she says  over time  discussion moved into what hbs is like  what they are looking for  the things dee hates seeing in applicants  essays and different stories from applicants  interviews  she continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph> dee was very engaging and she wanted us to succeed  but she was also very no nonsense   krishnamoorthy says  adding that leopold told them that the weekend was for them to discover what hbs is like but that she wasn t trying to sell them on it   but she is clearly very invested in having more women apply  which i thought was very inspiring to see from a senior admission director   she continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the last night  leopold asked the young women why they d chosen a women s college   i answered  talking about why initially i was a little apprehensive about going to barnard but how i fell in love with it   says london   i couldn t believe the connection i made with her in just one weekend   she added  noting that leopold is also a barnard graduate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a skewed view of hbs  a case or two in  london found herself thinking   wow  this is amazing  i am sold   but she caught herself almost as quickly   of course i m sold  this is the barnard like environment that i am used to  a room full of really smart  powerful women with great ideas respecting each other  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>reality an hbs class where men still outnumber women by a significant margin will not be quite the same  the peek weekend participants each acknowledged that this topic had come up in conversation  a panel featuring alumnae included graduates from the early     s as well as some from just last year   they told different tales   says coffee </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there were many indicators that the culture is shifting  cousins echoed   it s a reality that the field isn t as diverse as we may want it to be  but the field is changing   she said   from talking to the students  it was very clear that times are changing  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> at points we did joke that we should have an mba only for women   krishnamoorthy said   but hbs is trying to mimic the real world  and that definitely includes men  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the value of diversity in the classroom  and especially with the case method  was not lost on these women  someone raised the point during one discussion that there is a limit to what you can learn sitting in a room filled with people who all think the same way </paragraph>
    <paragraph> they need the emily londons in the room  but they also need the people who fundamentally disagree with me on every level   the barnard student points out   i came to understand just how important that would be with the case method   she continues  being in a room with a bunch of people who see the world exactly the same way as you do is vastly different from being in a room with people who disagree   that not only creates a much more exciting and dynamic classroom setting  but it can also help you become better able to articulate what you mean  help develop your problem solving skills and either solidify what you already believe or open your mind to other ideas   london offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs seems to have hit a homerun with peek  at least to hear these participants and professors tell it  when asked  the only thing people said they might change would be to make it longer  most meant by a day or so  although longer breaks between sessions might be a good place to start   we were a lot of women   points out coffee  with just    minute breaks and more than     women there   there were serious lines for snacks and nearby washrooms  </paragraph>

  <title>fuqua admissions dean dishes on essays and life</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s not every admissions director who will make time during her vacation to discuss how prospective business school applicants should approach their essays  and yet liz riley hargrove  associate dean for admissions at duke university s fuqua school of business  did just that  speaking from north carolina s outer banks this morning  before the kids woke up ready to head to the beach  she shared insights with clear admit on the essay prompts released last week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not a lot has changed this year in terms of fuqua s application  it turns out  applicants will find they have twice as much space in which to answer three short answer prompts one on short term goals  one on long term goals and one on an alternative plan should that first short term goal not pan out  this year candidates get     characters for each response  up from     last year   we wanted to give candidates a little more opportunity to expand upon their responses   she says of this year s doubled answer field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if the rest of the application looks pretty similar to last year s  that s because it is   we approach the admissions cycle really wanting to get to know our candidates   hargrove says   the essay questions we asked last year really helped us do that we really liked how we were able to engage applicants and glean information   she adds   absolutely  we are keeping them the same this year because they help us build a class that truly represents a microcosm of the world  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it doesn t hurt that applicants seem to really like the prompts too  she adds   the    random things  tweeting out their short  and long term goals they absolutely love it   she says  for her team to feel like they really get to know their applicants and for applicants to enjoy responding to the prompts is the epitome of a win win </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fuqua s     random things  as was the case last year  all applicants must reply to one required prompt and then select between two others  the required prompt      random things   invites applicants to share just that     quirky aspects of who they are  it grew out of a brainstorming session a few years ago when hargrove and her staff were trying to come up with an outside the box idea that would be in line with fuqua s entrepreneurial reputation  the prompt has been on the application ever since  in fact  hargrove likes it so much that she makes everyone who joins her own team share their own    random facts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she acknowledges that for as welcome as this unusual prompt may prove for many applicants  it may seem daunting to some others   we always worry about how the process appears culturally   she says   i think if you are on facebook and you tweet and you re on instagram it seems pretty natural but sometimes internationally it doesn t always translate   with this in mind  she and her team have shared their own random facts on the fuqua blog and elsewhere to give people an idea of how to respond </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here are a few of hargrove s own </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her team does worry some about how candidates feel about revealing personal things  but that s really what they are looking for   we want them to be a little bit vulnerable   she says   our objective is to admit people who will be impactful and really want to come to duke  and we find you can really get a sense of who people are and why they do what they do when they tell you about the quirky parts of their life  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when to opt for the optional essay like many other schools  fuqua does invite applicants to provide an optional third essay outlining any circumstances the admissions committee should be aware of  this is the perfect opportunity to explain a gap in work experience  a semester of lower grades in college  anything that might not appear consistent with the rest of your application   when someone uses this space to explain something that doesn t make sense to me  it s awesome   she says  for instance  learning that a family member got sick during your sophomore year in college can really help her team understand why your grades may have slipped then   but if it is a regurgitation of another essay or something a candidate has written for another school  it s just irritating   she cautions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an attempt to make things easier for both applicants and their recommenders  fuqua has taken steps to standardize its letters of recommendation some this year   we want to make it easier for people who are applying to multiple schools   she says   we get that  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most valuable letters of recommendation  though  are those that provide a good assessment of both a candidate s strengths and weaknesses   oftentimes  candidates think it has to be from the ceo of their company and say really good things about them but the best recommendation is the assessment of the good  the bad and the ugly   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to drive this point home  hargrove shares a few very personal things about herself  once  when her daughter was an infant  she burped her before heading off to work  where someone asked her what was on the back of her shirt   i went to work with baby vomit on my back   she says  more recently  in the past year  she has experienced several major losses and expanded her family to take in an orphaned nephew   i think about all of that and how it may have impacted me   what would someone write about me this past year    she wonders aloud </paragraph>
    <paragraph> perfection is not required   she says   in fact  the students who go into the job search process trying to be perfect are the ones who struggle the most  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>parting advice   my advice is always be yourself   hargrove says without a moment s hesitation   the thing i love about welcoming our incoming class is feeling like they have represented their most authentic self  individually and collectively  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she looks at her job as needing to build a microcosm of the world and to do that effectively she needs to get to know the applicants   the diversity of the incoming class is what makes the mba so transformative   she says   just be yourself  because everyone else is taken  </paragraph>

  <title>mba provides both immediate and lasting value  say graduates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>type  the mba is  into google  and the autocomplete box fills with inauspicious indicators of the degree s value   the mba is losing its magic  is followed by  the mba is worthless  and  why the mba is a waste of time and money   students graduating with an mba disagree and quite emphatically according to a survey report released today at the annual graduate management admission council  gmac  conference in denver </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business school graduates are clear in their judgment that their degrees not only provided immediate value  but lasting value   bob alig  gmac s executive vice president for school products  said in a statement announcing the results  indeed  nine out of    of the more than       graduating business school students who responded to the gmac global management education graduate survey  gmegs  rate the value of their degree as good to outstanding  and    percent would recommend their program to others considering a graduate business degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>graduates who snagged jobs early in the recruitment process were most likely to credit the degree with helping them develop skills in the areas of managing human capital  knowledge of general business functions and working well with others  gmac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>class of      graduates when surveyed in february and march of      felt overwhelmingly that the degree increased their employability  eighty six percent said the mba improved their chances of finding a job that meets their expectations  and    percent felt it both provided them with a competitive advantage and prepared them to meet challenges in the job market  the degree also introduced them to new career opportunities  said    percent of respondents </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what stands out in the gmegs survey  as well as in other surveys we have conducted over the years  is that a graduate management degree is an outstanding investment in the personal  professional  and financial aspirations of these students   alig added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it doesn t hurt that mbas are graduating into a great market  with early employment success reaching a three year high  according to survey respondents     percent of job seeking graduates from full time two year mba programs had a job offer in hand before graduation  up from    percent last year   salaries  too  are up  globally  mba grads with early job offers report a median    percent pay bump over their pre degree salary  that s up from    percent last year and    percent the year before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so why the disparity between what google suggests  the mba is  and what actual degree holders report  perhaps like the iphone s autocorrect function  google s autocomplete function still offers room for improvement </paragraph>

  <title>new certificate program at nyu stern lets working professionals sample the mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>not sure you re ready for a complete mba  why not try out a quarter of an mba  a program introduced earlier this year at new york university  nyu  stern school of business lets you do just that  the new advanced professional certificate  apc  program lets participants take five courses in either finance  marketing or general business taught by stern s world class faculty  alongside students in the school s part time mba program  upon completion of any of the three tracks  participants receive a certificate registered with the new york state department of education </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program is great for working professionals who want to quickly build knowledge in a specific area as well as for those who already have an mba but want to refresh or supplement their expertise  qualified candidates can apply for admission to the program and take courses on a part time basis in mba classes where there is capacity  enrolled students will have up to two years to complete the five courses  or    credits  required for certification in any of the three tracks </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one common theme we continue to hear with growing intensity from our prospective students  particularly millennials  is the importance of time how can i learn what i need to know as quickly as possible to excel in my current position or to be competitive for new functions   says nyu stern assistant dean of mba admissions isser gallogly   the apcs provide students with specific area knowledge fast and they are offered on weeknights and saturdays  making them accessible to working professionals  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the potential applications of this new program are vast  gallogly continues   for example  the finance track could quickly empower those who didn t major in finance in college  but who now work in the industry  with a broader perspective that helps them excel in their function   he says  the marketing track  meanwhile  might appeal to undergraduate liberal arts majors who are now looking to obtain marketing fundamentals along with the latest trends in analytics and digital marketing  and the general business track lets entrepreneurs pick and choose a handful of business courses that can help them get their ventures off the ground </paragraph>
    <paragraph>apc students can choose from evening or saturday classes on stern s manhattan campus or evening classes in westchester with students in stern s langone part time mba program  participants who don t already have an mba can also choose to apply to stern s langone part time mba program while pursuing their apc  provided they do so and are admitted before receiving their certificate  the can apply the apc credits toward the part time mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think it s a very cool and innovative offering   gallogly says  noting that it can be a perfect way to take a range of classes even if you don t have the time or money to do a full mba  it can also be a great opportunity for those who already have an mba  he says   maybe you were working in business and took time off to have a family   he offers   now you re ready to go back into the workforce and want to get up to speed this can be a perfect on ramp  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to ensure that all apc students can keep pace with the stern mba students they will be studying alongside  candidates for the apc program are required to have at least two years of work experience  go through a formal application process and submit either a gmat or gre score or proof of an mba degree  the first apc students will begin coursework in fall       and courses will be offered in the fall  spring and summer semesters  students may take a maximum of three classes  or nine credits  per semester </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is really nice to be able to provide different ways for people to get the world class education that nyu stern offers   gallogly says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>complete details are available here for the apc selection criteria and application components  view sample courses here </paragraph>

  <title>cornell s johnson school admission director shares excitement about forte conference</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>current mba students and alumni from leading schools around the country and the globe convened yesterday and today for the      forte foundation mba women s leadership conference  held this year at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  representatives from forte s sponsor schools are as important a part of the conference as the student attendees  admissions directors and others from forte s    sponsor schools attend in order to meet students  learn from speakers and network with sponsor companies  they also share their own challenges and triumphs as they relate to enhancing the experience of current and prospective female mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>judi byers  executive director of admissions and financial aid at the s c  johnson graduate school of management at cornell university  shared her excitement via twitter about attending this year s conference  clear admit caught up with byers  who joined the johnson school earlier this spring  to learn a little more about what she most hoped to gain from the event </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what part of the conference agenda caught your attention first  what are you most excited about </paragraph>
    <paragraph>judi byers  i m most excited to welcome our new students  it s incredibly fulfilling to meet the next group of women to pursue a cornell mba  and i m really pleased to be able to welcome them in person  forte does a great job of creating the environment for us to meet our high potential female applicants as they are preparing to apply to business school  and this conference is a way for us to support our new students as they get underway with their mba experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of the conference agenda  i m looking forward to sharing best case practices around student led diversity initiatives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  as an admissions director  what are you looking most to draw from the conference </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jb  i m looking forward to hearing about what schools  companies and organizations like forte are doing proactively to expand the pipeline of women who apply to business schools  we each have the opportunity and responsibility to help with increasing the representation and success of women in the workplace  particularly in positions of leadership  coming together to discuss ways for us to accomplish this is an important part of building awareness for those who are either planning to apply to business school at some point in the future or who perhaps have not yet considered the mba or field of business as a potential pathway </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what impact do you think some of what you hear and learn in the next two days could have on how you approach the upcoming admissions season at the johnson school  the following admissions season </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jb  i d like to hear more about the concerns and challenges that are top of mind for candidates  i m also looking forward to hearing about the initiatives that forte is working on to partner with schools to engage candidates even earlier on in the pipeline </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what role can the forte conference and events like it play in helping to increase the enrollment of female students at leading mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jb  forte continues to have an important and influential role in helping female students attend the world s top business schools  i think the forte conference and events like it provide an excellent venue to further the dialogue about the opportunities  support and resources available to women prior to  during and following an mba program  these events are one of the ways attention may be given to promote the benefits of pursing an mba as well as how candidates might leverage the experience to advance their careers </paragraph>

    <paragraph>last week s momentous supreme court ruling on marriage equality helped more people than ever before feel like the united states is a great place to be part of the lgbtq community  maybe it got you wondering about which business schools are the best places to be part of that community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as it turns out  there s a ranking for that  and this year  new york university  nyu  stern school of business soared to the top  winning recognition for getting more of its student body involved to help foster an lgbtq inclusive campus culture than any other top business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mba ally challenge rankings  released in june  are the culmination of a year long competition launched by nonprofit organization friendfactor as part of an effort to encourage straight people to become visible and active allies in their workplace and campus communities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>twenty three schools participated this year  shattering prior records  together  the business schools involved       students as allies more than double last year s participation of       and hosted more than     events and activities  collectively  the schools improved lgbtq inclusiveness on campuses by    percent based on measures taken at the beginning and again at the end of the school year  friendfactor reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the challenge  schools  efforts to activate their student bodies are ranked on three criteria  the number of students involved  the number of activities they execute and their results on a survey that measures lgbtq awareness and the inclusiveness of campus culture  to help make it clear that lgbtq students are welcome and supported on their campuses  participating schools have done everything from draping their student centers in rainbow flags to organizing inter section competitions to partnering with local lgbtq community groups </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nyu stern shot up from the number seven spot last year to outrank every other school  students at stern held    activities through the course of the year  including a comprehensive ally training series and a huge april ally week  the results were staggering  with    percent participation among the student body </paragraph>
    <paragraph> am i shocked that stern won the friendfactor challenge  no  i m not   says rachel hurnyak  mba       who served as president of lgbtq student group outclass   our community leaned into hard topics this year  there were awkward moments and sometimes misinformed things were said  but  as a community  we let it get messy  doing so allowed us to see what needed to be cleaned up  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to holding more events and establishing more allies than any other school  stern also instituted a gender neutral restroom on each floor of the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last year s winner  uc berkeley s haas school of business  slipped to number two this year  followed closely by the university of michigan s ross school of business  each had more than    activities and    percent student participation nothing to be ashamed of  usc s marshall school of business won for  most improved school   increasing inclusiveness by    percent over the course of the year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alison goggin  executive director of mba admissions at stern  shared that on hearing the news she joked with colleagues in admissions at haas that it is only fitting for stern and haas to hold the top spots  given the schools  respective locations in greenwich village and berkeley  birthplaces of the lgbtq civil rights movement in the     s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern is a program that has long made emotional quotient  eq  an integral part of its mba program   this year  several of us tried something new by injecting diversity and inclusion into stern s eq formula   hurnyak says  she and classmates asked the community to attend ally trainings and small group discussions  telling them the reasons would reveal themselves later </paragraph>
    <paragraph> later came sooner than we thought   she says  just a couple of weeks ago  when caitlyn jenner s vanity fair cover was revealed  a male investment banker and former classmate texted her to ask for clarity on a women s studies concept discussed in an ally training  meanwhile on facebook  another former classmate posted that caitlyn s gender identity is separate from her sexual orientation   i was overwhelmed with pride   says hurnyak </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the effects of stern s efforts to increase inclusiveness and haas s and ross s and every other school s will only ripple out    when these mbas enter the workforce  yes  they ll be able to stand up for injustices  but they will also know how to broach the topics that everyone else is too afraid to touch   hurnyak points out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>friendfactor  which calls itself  the lgbt rights organization for straight friends   praised participating schools  noting that    of the    achieved gold  silver or bronze status for reaching allyship participation levels and activity milestones  eleven schools reached gold marked by at least    percent student participation and more than nine activities  in addition to the three front runners  these schools include the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  uva s darden school  northwestern s kellogg school of management  columbia business school  duke s fuqua school  wake forest university school of business and unc s kenan flagler school </paragraph>

  <title>today s mobile generation wants business school admissions on the go</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>business schools that aren t meeting prospective applicants on their mobile devices and via social media may need to rethink their strategy and fast  this according to a recent survey measuring how today s mobile generation consumes media as part of the mba admissions process  results of the survey  conducted by southwark consulting and the graduate management admissions council  gmac   were released last week </paragraph>
    <paragraph> everyone has read stories and surveys about this newest generation shifting its media consumption habits   says southwark consultant alex brown  who co authored the study   the interesting thing about this study is that it is the first one to specifically target people applying to or considering business school   the survey s     respondents from around the world were all registered on mba com  the official website of the graduate management admissions test  gmat   which is the primary entrance exam for business school applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the results of the survey confirm what has been reported in the popular press that the rate of smartphone adoption among millennials is ubiquitous  between    and    percent  it also revealed social media s significant rise in importance as a place where this audience gathers its news  in broad terms  people have been looking to the internet at the expense of print  radio and tv for some time now  but the survey helped shine a spotlight on the newest phenomenon  which is that the current generation of business school applicants now learn things first on their phone not their pc and in their news feed  be it facebook  linkedin  twitter or some other social media platform </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business schools  on the whole  are laggards in their adoption of using these platforms effectively to communicate with their audiences   says brown  who worked in graduate management admissions for    years  including seven at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  before leaving to teach digital marketing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that the schools are lagging is par for the course  says brown  since there s always an element of catch up involved with technological shifts   there is no criticism here  but what business schools have been doing in terms of their mobile presence is a little bit behind the curve   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools  therefore  need to have a strategy that gets their content into those news feeds  since doing so makes that content more relevant and more likely to be seen by people using mobile devices  brown says  the importance of social media has only continued to rise  with more millennials finding their news there than on traditional news sites or via news aggregators  the survey found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an important way to reach female applicants the survey also found that millennial women spend more time on their mobile devices a day than their male counterparts  with    percent of female respondents using their smartphones three or more hours per day  compared with only    percent of males  and while men and women report using the various social media platforms at about equal rates  women are much more likely than men     percent versus    percent  to rank social media as their number one news source  according to the survey results </paragraph>
    <paragraph> having an equal gender mix has always been an issue at business schools  so one way to make sure you are reaching out to female populations is through mobile and social media   brown notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>linkedin trumps facebook as source for mba news when asked where they would like to receive graduate management news  more respondents endorsed linkedin than facebook     percent versus    percent   this finding was unsurprising  given that an mba is a professional degree and linkedin is a professional network  notes brown   what it tells us is that to the extent that schools have an effective linkedin strategy  they should be pushing it   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>segmented out by age  the findings of the study grew even more pronounced  younger respondents were more likely to spend long periods of time on mobile and social media and cited social as their first source of news at a higher rate   things are going to continue to move in this direction rapidly  and business schools need to have a proper mobile marketing strategy to remain relevant   brown says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what does that mobile strategy look like  should schools all rush out to develop their own apps to reside on the phones of this new generation of applicants  not necessarily  according to the survey  indeed     percent of respondents said they would download an mba admissions app from their target schools if it included features such as the ability to complete the application online  view where it is in the application cycle  receive admissions decisions and updates on events and communicate with alumni and current students   you have to be a pretty well branded school to make that leap of faith and spend the resources to design such an app   brown says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>complicating things even further  though the majority of respondents reported having more than    apps on their smartphones  they also revealed that they only use about eight of those apps on a daily basis  to become one of these eight habitually used apps presents a major challenge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a more realistic strategy for most business schools will be to make sure they have a very strong social media presence in the linkedin  facebook and twitter platforms that are among the habitually used apps  another important point of focus  as suggested by the survey results  should be on ensuring that a school s website is optimized for mobile access  since respondents report spending as much time accessing the internet via a mobile device as they do via a pc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while not without its challenges  the shifting media consumption habits of millennials present exciting opportunities for business schools   it s all new and ever evolving  but it does provide schools with a direct communications channel into the applicant pool   says brown  this is vastly different from times past  when admissions offices had to reach applicants by running ads in a magazine  for example   to now have the opportunity to move content out directly to applicants and engage in two way communication is very cool   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>view the complete  gmac southwark mobile social use survey  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>southwark consulting is led by graham richmond  an original co founder of clear admit  </paragraph>

  <title>forte foundation women s leadership conference draws record attendance</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>current female mba students and alumni have come out in droves this year for the      forte foundation mba women s leadership conference  taking place now at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  kicking off with a sponsors meeting on thursday for school and company representatives  followed by a career focused day of programming yesterday and a day centered around professional development today  the conference this year has welcomed     mba women and alumni  in addition to more than     speakers and presenters  for those who don t know forte  it is a nonprofit consortium of leading companies and top business schools devoted to launching women into successful business careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think we have pulled together some really interesting topics that a lot people want to hear about   says elissa sangster  forte foundation executive director  when asked what contributed to this year s record attendance   we are excited to see it all come together  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sangster remembers making name tags by hand for the    or so attendees that came to the inaugural forte conference    years ago  a lot has changed since then  her staff  which at that time consisted of herself and one other part time employee  has grown to    this year and will expand to    or    next year  she says  which is a good thing  since attendance has increased nine fold  participating schools have grown from    at most to    this year  and sponsor companies now number     sangster says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we had no idea the huge growth we would see   she says  thinking back to that first conference in        we had about          in the bank back then  and we have around    million now  so that is significant growth as well  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the number of forte fellows women receiving fellowships through the organization to pursue mbas at sponsor business schools has increased even more significantly  from fewer than    in the first two years to       today  to date  sponsor schools have given almost     million to forte fellows  according to the organization s website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with increasing coffers and rising demand  forte has vastly expanded programming for its annual conference  what initially amounted to half a day on friday and half a day on saturday has grown to two jam packed days of speakers  workshops  networking events and more  preceded by the sponsors meeting on thursday  sangster herself greeted attendees yesterday  followed by a welcome address from mcdonough school of business dean david a  thomas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with the theme  let s power up   this year s event boasts an incredible array of noteworthy speakers  as well as more than    workshops on topics ranging from money management to communications strategies to help make your voice heard in the classroom and beyond </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the keynote speakers are elana fine  managing director of the dingman center for entrepreneurship at the university of maryland smith school of business  and lucinda duncalfe  ceo of monetate  who will both discuss female entrepreneurship  cindy solomon  a customer service and employee engagement guru and strategic consultant to leading organizations including the mayo clinic  raytheon  oracle and google  will deliver another keynote address on how women can build confidence  power and potential </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  this year s conference also includes dialogue with leadership  a recurring component in which c suite women come together in candid conversation to share how they rose to the top  scheduled presenters for this session include jocelyn cunningham  market offering portfolio leader for deloitte  and gisel ruiz  executive vice president of walmart s international people division </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the conference has grown over the years  sangster and her team have divided content into elements that are primarily career focused on the first day and programming devoted to professional development on the second day  to appeal to the needs and interests of first year mbas and second years and alumni  respectively   everything on saturday has a professional development component  which makes it great for second year students  as well as alumni who may only be able to attend for one day   sangster says  the conference now also features a company expo  giving attendees the opportunity to engage directly with sponsor companies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sangster herself is most excited this year about today s closing session  a panel entitled mbas and the politics of doing good  which will include presenters laura walker  new york public radio president and ceo  jane mosbacher morris  founder and ceo of to the market  associate assistant deputy secretary of education ursula wright of the u s  department of education  and mary humphrey  ceo of the jane goodall institute   i think this is such an important topic for women especially   she says   we really want to help them connect the dots between the mba and doing amazing things that really have high impact  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of sangster s greatest personal goals and that of the forte foundation as a whole is to increase female enrollment at top mba programs   we are particularly proud of seeing the needle move it s grown from    percent in the top programs when we started in      to about    percent today   she says   it s a huge accomplishment and change  but it is still not enough  we want to see that average continue to move forward  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though the needle forte most wants to see move is female enrollment in top business schools  the mission of the organization is much broader   we don t spend all of our time focused on that because we need to focus on the pipeline   sangster says  beyond its work with current mba women and alumni  forte is also involved in a big initiative to engage with college students  ensuring that college women are exploring business no matter what their major is  a pilot  rising star  program will provide current college students with a curriculum they can follow to prepare for jobs after graduation that will ultimately help them become top applicants to mba programs  as part of the program  which forte is currently piloting with    institutions but hopes to expand  college women will get to engage with current forte fellows and women business leaders  get to know the forte website and resources there and be encouraged to explore leadership opportunities within student organizations on their campuses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the goal of the rising star program is not to encourage female college students to go straight to business school from college  since the schools and companies forte works with are not looking for that  it s really designed to help college women begin to think more about their possible future career paths so that they can make choices to support them  sangster says   if you have left undergrad and know you are going back to school later in your career  you are going to be more intentional about saving money  for example   she says   by reaching women in college and helping them with a plan  we hope to make it easier to get from there to applying  enrolling and paying for the mba  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another primary focus for forte is to serve as coaches and advocates for prospective female applicants to leading mba programs  the forte mbalaunch for women program includes group  one on one and peer coaching  office hours hosted by subject matter experts on every aspect of the mba admissions process and connections to current mba students at target schools   mbalaunch is really designed to walk them through the    months leading up to entering a top mba program   sangster says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though sangster is clearly always thinking about the big picture  we hope she s also gotten to focus on the moment and enjoy all that this year s conference has had to offer  the growth is impressive  and we ll be watching to see what she and her team at forte do next </paragraph>

  <title>a european mba  right for you </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with the dollar reaching a    year high against the euro earlier this spring  much ink has been spilled about how the time is right to head to europe for an mba  indeed  pursuing a graduate management education abroad can present a range of advantages for american students with cost savings chief among them  especially given the recent relative strength of the dollar  that said  the decision of whether or not to head to one of europe s top business schools is a highly personal one best made after careful consideration of many factors that extend well beyond any savings tied to currency rates </paragraph>
    <paragraph> oh yes  i definitely did benefit from the exchange rate   says alexander eldred  a washington  dc native currently completing his mba at france s hec paris  as luck would have it  eldred paid the bulk of hec s        euro tuition in march  right as the euro dipped to      to the dollar  had he paid the entire tuition then  it would have amounted to         for a degree that just a year earlier would have run him          add to that living expenses  which are similarly lower than they have been historically thanks to the exchange rate  and the savings stack up   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>shorter programs mean lower opportunity cost as happy as he was for the savings  eldred notes they were  really just a drop in the bucket  when you are talking about the cost of an mba  far more significant than any currency fluctuations is the shorter length of european mba programs  many of which range from    to    months  compared to the two year commitment far more common among u s  programs  this contributes not only to lower overall tuition costs  but also to markedly reduced opportunity costs  since students return to the workforce more quickly </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another north american student  meaghan kappel from toronto  chose hec in great part because of its    month program   the program length is perfect   she says  providing the ideal medium between north american two year programs and accelerated    month programs  which she ultimately decided felt too short   sixteen months gives you enough time to think  but you aren t losing too much of your salary and your professional experience  which was a big concern of mine coming into the program   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kirk bullock  a southern californian who decided to head to barcelona for his mba  was likewise drawn by a shorter program   a huge reason i chose esade was the flexibility of its program   he says  at esade  students can chose to complete the degree in        or    months  bullock began in september      and will finish in september      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> not only is the cost of the degree less  but it also puts you back into the workforce making a salary sooner   he says   to me  the two year programs just seemed too long too long to be out of the workforce  too long to be away from my network   he says  an additional advantage  he adds  was a more intense  focused experience   the networking that you do is much more intense  you make great friends and connections and you work them the entire time   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>diversity  diversity  diversity ask american students why they chose a european mba program  and you will undoubtedly hear diversity among their top responses   what is great about hec is how incredibly diverse it is   says eldred  ninety percent of hec s students are international  drawn from more than    different countries  this exposure to different cultures  languages  experiences and leadership styles is invaluable  including in the eyes of recruiters  he says   what a lot of firms are looking for is people who can play nicely in the sandbox   he notes  skills that naturally emerge from such diverse situations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> everyone touts diversity  but at a lot of places that are supposedly diverse  you have a majority student body and then you have the others   eldred continues   here  no one is even close to a majority the french only make up    percent   he continues   if you only talk to people from your own country  you won t have very many friends   he states matter of factly  since there are never more than four or five students in a single class from the same country   you are forced to get out and meet people from elsewhere and work with them   he says   hardly a day goes by when i don t speak four different languages  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bullock says the same about esade   if you go to berkeley and you sit in a class  diverse means you are still going to have at least    percent of people being american   he says  not so at european schools   we have maybe    percent spanish in our class   professors  too  come from all over the world  each tailoring courses toward their cultural preference  which further extends the diversity of experiences mba students encounter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kappel  too  touts the incredible value of the peer to peer learning that takes place in classes with such true diversity   every single class at hec involves at least one group assignment   she says  her very first group included one canadian  one indian  one japanese  one chinese and one moroccan  she recalls   when you are forced to work as a group and you all come from a different country  each of you leads in your way or  as importantly  learns when not to lead  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the role that language plays though the language of instruction at most leading european business schools is english  some americans choose european mbas to obtain or improve proficiency in another language  this was very much the case for jenna meulemans  a student at spain s iese business school  though meulemans studied spanish in junior high and high school and had worked and studied abroad  she was not fluent before moving to barcelona  at iese  she took part in an accelerated language course before classes began and has continued to seek out opportunities to strengthen her spanish with classmates and friends  because iese s campus is right in barcelona  day to day life provides plenty of opportunity to practice as well  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bullock  for his part  didn t speak a word of spanish and had never left the united states before heading to esade  but coming from a career in hospitality in southern california and hoping to ultimately return there  the opportunity to learn the language was a major factor in his decision of where to study   in my industry  spanish is a huge bonus  and it is such a prominent spoken language   he says  adding that language proficiency will open up possibilities for him not only in spain or returning to the west coast  but also in the majority of latin america  central america and other parts of the united states </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he has really focused on the language  taking classes provided through the school  working with private tutors and speaking with friends   my spanish is finally to the point where i have proficiency   he says  still  his hope upon graduation is to remain in barcelona and work in the hospitality industry  and for that he knows he still needs greater mastery  so he ll keep working on it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at hec  where students live and take classes on a campus outside of paris  it s not actually essential to master french  according to several students there  the language that everyone has in common is english  so much discussion both in class and outside of it defaults to that  having said that  you must speak french if you hope to work in france after graduating  says the quadrilingual eldred  who speaks english  french  german and chinese </paragraph>
    <paragraph> speaking french is really a prerequisite for having a fruitful career in france   he says  which is no different than in the united states  he points out   speaking the local language is normally a pre requisite for employment in most countries   formerly a spice trader in china and an ingredient buyer for mars in tennessee  eldred does intend to remain in france after graduating  targeting operations management jobs in paris in the food or transportation industries </paragraph>
    <paragraph>potential drawbacks of a european mba students who set their sights on working in europe after completing their mba should be aware that european salaries are generally lower than in the united states with the united kingdom  and london in particular  an exception  the degree costs less  but your earning power coming out  if you remain in france or spain for example  will also likely be lower </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the cost of living  though  is also lower   i will probably make less in barcelona than i would if i returned to the united states   concedes meulemans   but i have an incredible apartment here that costs a third of what i would have in new york  where it would be much smaller   she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bullock takes the same view   yes  the salary potential of going back to the states is much higher   he says   the cost of living in europe is lower  however  not enough to balance the equation equally  but it does help  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all of the americans interviewed for this story hope to remain in europe after graduation  though a couple indicated they may return to the states at a later date or as a back up plan  they each acknowledge that brand recognition for european schools among u s  employers could pose something of an obstacle to students hoping to return to the states immediately upon graduation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is a small disadvantage   says bullock   i do have to take the next step of explaining to an employer that esade is a top ranked school   he says   back in the states  if i say   berkeley   they know berkeley   but once the caliber of the school is established  he finds it s much less of a barrier than some people might perceive  the value of the brand within spain and in europe more generally  meanwhile  is enormous  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>eldred says much the same of hec paris   i think it is completely surmountable   he says   the hec name has enormous value in france here  people s jaws drop when you say you go to hec   outside of france  there is no question that the street value of the hec name is not as high as that of some u s  schools  he says  still  he s not concerned   the people who are hiring for the types of jobs you will want coming from hec will have heard of it   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the schools are also working actively to elevate their brand among u s  audiences and enhancing career services resources for students seeking work in the u s  after graduation  the current students say </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is starting to change   eldred says of hec s recognition outside of europe  things like the school s number one ranking among european schools in the economist this past year don t hurt  he points out  but he also attributes the shift to efforts by the school itself and to a greater number of north americans pursuing european mbas   it is an overnight process  no  but it is changing   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but make no mistake  living in another country is not always easy  the american students say   it can definitely be challenging   says bullock   adjusting to the culture is hard  especially for americans   he says of spain   things are much more relaxed here in terms of what we are used to  and there is much less convenience   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though she wouldn t trade her experience for anything  meulemans says that being so far from friends and family has sometimes been difficult   especially when you are doing something as intense as an mba   she says   it s not like being in new york  and getting to fly home to chicago for a weekend when you want to   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not right for everyone but for some  just right should the short term savings presented by currency fluctuations propel americans who ve never before considered getting an mba abroad to drop everything and start packing their bags  no  say most american students studying in europe right now </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but if you are a global citizen of the world or are ready and willing to work hard to become one the diverse classrooms  peer to peer learning opportunities  shorter programs and global networks presented by european business schools may be for you  if so  depending on where the dollar goes from here  you may save a little dough as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>still wondering whether a european mba might be right for you  the mba tour is hosting a conference in new york city on monday  june   nd  exclusively for applicants considering european mba programs  </paragraph>

  <title>georgetown mcdonough s shari hubert points to subtle changes in new application</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>refreshed following a two day staff retreat  the head of admissions at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business took time this morning to share with clear admit her advice to prospective candidates on how to approach the school s application for the class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though its essay question remains unchanged from last year  there are subtle shifts elsewhere in the application  says shari hubert  who has served as georgetown mcdonough s associate dean of mba admissions since       among other things  applicants will have greater opportunity to highlight experiences living and working abroad  read on to learn more about these subtle shifts  as well as hubert s advice on how to make taking a risk in response to the essay pay off </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if it aint broke  hubert and team decided to maintain last year s open ended  why you   essay prompt because they liked the insights it provided into applicants  backgrounds and motivations   it worked out really well for us last year allowing applicants to tell us their story in their own words   hubert says   what really stood out were those applicants who were willing to take a risk  be open and vulnerable  and tell us what they think and what is important to them   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because the application features separate fields where candidates are asked to share their short  and long term goals  hubert and her team are looking more in response to the essay for applicants  rationale behind pursuing an mba  their philosophy on life and how they think mcdonough fits within it  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the line between taking a risk to be open and vulnerable and taking things too far is a fine one  as guidance  hubert reveals the risk she herself took when applying to harvard business school  asked to write about her greatest accomplishment  hubert shared that she had re established relations with her father  from whom she had been estranged for    years  when she was a junior in college   i opened myself up and took a real risk  but i was able to tie it back to my ability to take initiative  to be a leader  to not be afraid to take that risk   she says   if you are going to make yourself vulnerable and share something truly personal  you need to think about the end goal   she continues   how can you tie it into the values of our institution and illustrate how it makes you the type of student who would thrive here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcdonough s core values and just what are the values that mcdonough holds dear  you ask  one of the things that mcdonough prizes most as an institution is its global perspective and the global nature of its students  hubert says  true to its jesuit founders  the school also seeks students who will be women and men in service to others   of course  you come to business school to fulfill your own dreams and aspirations  but we also want students who are asking themselves what they can do to leave the institution better than it was before   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  georgetown is known for its collaboration  hubert adds   our students are continually thinking not only  will this help me succeed   but also  will it help my classmates succeed    she says  ultimately  this collaborative nature only reinforces the value of the brand  because if both succeed  it is better for the value of the degree  she notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  mcdonough again this year gives applicants the opportunity to submit optional essays to explain gaps in employment  provide information not otherwise included in their application or  for re applicants  show how they have strengthened their candidacy since their last application   for us  the optional essay is really key when we might have a concern about an element of a candidate s application this is an opportunity for them to proactively address that concern   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a few subtle shifts  even though its essay stayed the same this year  hubert draws attention to a couple of changes in the application that might be of interest  last year  the school had a broad question inquiring about applicants  global experiences whether they had ever volunteered  studied  worked or lived abroad  this year  hubert s team has broken this question into two parts to get a better sense  specifically  of applicants  global experience when it comes to working  living or traveling for business abroad  since this will have the greatest impact on their experience at mcdonough </paragraph>
    <paragraph>also new this year  the school will now offer an application fee waiver to individuals who are part of the forte mbalaunch program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>application volume growth mcdonough s application volume increased this past application season roughly    percent over the prior year  with the majority of the increase coming from domestic applicants   we were very pleased   hubert says  she attributes the growth to a range of factors  including a greater emphasis on digital marketing and public relations  as well as the school s partnership with customer journey mapping firm peer insight  which helped her team think about the application process from the applicants  perspective </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another shift hubert saw as part of the most recent application cycle was an increase in the number of applicants laser focused on scholarship opportunities   applicants are looking very closely at how they will fund and finance their mba  what the roi is  whether it is worth taking out loans   she says  it used to be that students didn t mind taking out loans for the mba  but with more and more applicants already having huge student loan debt  that is changing  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are getting more requests for scholarships and more appeals for scholarship reconsideration   she says  hubert has championed flexibility at the school in terms of being willing to accept requests for appeal  formalizing the process through which applicants can ask that their scholarship request be reconsidered </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fortunately  says hubert  mcdonough has also had an increase in its scholarship funding   that has been dean david thomas s number one priority to increase funding for mba scholarships   she says   that has helped us provide a bit more scholarship to more people who merit it  </paragraph>

  <title>mba applicants say fuqua  chicago booth get to know them best  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>applicants who applied to leading business schools in the         admissions cycle felt that duke s fuqua school of business and the university of chicago booth school of business got to know them better than others  according to survey results released today by the association of international graduate admissions consultants  aigac   notably  scores for how well schools got to know applicants fell this year over last for every school except chicago booth and more so at schools that reduced the number of essays applicants could reply to in the         application cycle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>aigac  which was co founded in      to set and promote high ethical standards and professional development among graduation admissions consultants  has been conducting an annual survey of mba applicants for the past six years  survey questions are designed to solicit feedback from applicants on everything from the tools they use to research programs to where and why they ultimately enroll to how they expect an mba will impact their future careers and salaries   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants select schools based on reputation  career impact aigac found this year  as in past years  surveys  that applicants are most influenced by a school s reputation when deciding where to apply  asked to allocate points out of     to each of    considerations  respondents allocated an average of    points to a school s reputation  more than any other category  career impact was second  at    points  followed by career placement stats at    and location  alumni network and school culture  which all received an average of   points each  less important to applicants were considerations such as academic focus  net cost of program  quality of faculty  global opportunities and program facilities  the survey found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the other interesting findings this year was growing interest by female applicants in entrepreneurship  compared to a slight decline among male applicants  this year  approximately    percent of both female and male applicants indicated an interest in entrepreneurship </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  consulting proved a main priority  with almost    percent of male and female candidates expressing an interest in working in that industry after finishing an mba  candidates continue to expect the mba to have a significant impact on their earnings potential  with both male and female respondents anticipating a roughly    percent salary increase within the first six months of graduating </paragraph>
    <paragraph>almost half     percent  of survey respondents indicated that they used admissions consultants as part of the application process  although male applicants were significantly more likely than female applicants     percent versus    percent  to do so  female applicants who did use admissions consultants were more likely to also pay for test prep support  the aigac survey found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the vast majority of applicants     percent  reported submitting gmat scores  although significantly more female applicants     percent  than male applicants    percent  submitted gre scores   of the female applicants who chose to take the gre  more than    percent cited the benefits of the test format and outcomes as their reason why </paragraph>
    <paragraph>aigac launches initiative to improve recommendation process last year     percent of applicants reported that one or more of their recommenders asked them to write letters of recommendation for themselves  many respondents felt that the recommendation process was onerous for recommenders and called for schools to adopt a shared  standard set of questions  aigac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this year  in response to some of these concerns  aigac has launched a new initiative to make the recommendation process easier to navigate  it has created an informational document explaining the letter or recommendation process  discussing what schools are hoping to read and offering tips on how applicants can guide recommenders in ways that are consistent with what schools have advised on their own websites  working drafts of this document are currently available on the aigac website in english  spanish  german  japanese and hindi  and mandarin  french and portuguese versions will be available soon </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the survey results reflected responses from     applicants gathered online between september      and april      </paragraph>

  <title>mccombs director of mba admissions weighs in on essays  application changes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin earlier this week posted its essay questions for the         application season  though the prompts remain largely the same as last year  mccombs director of mba admissions rodrigo malta had several interesting tidbits of news to share yesterday in an interview with clear admit </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we really  really  really love our first essay question   malta says of the prompt that invites applicants to introduce themselves to members of their future mccombs cohort   we have had it for three years now  so we had it way before harvard did   he adds with a satisfied chuckle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when the question debuted at mccombs the year before last  applicants were asked to reply in essay form  last year  mccombs offered greater flexibility  inviting applicants to choose between writing an essay  sharing a video introduction or sharing an about me profile   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>malta and his team loved the variety of responses that came in last year   about    percent of applicants submitted something other than a written essay  which far exceeded our expectations   he says  but his team really does not have a preference for one communication method over another   we want candidates to choose whichever communication method they think will allow them to put their best foot forward   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the team has seen some really wonderful examples of each communication method  as well as some really terrible ones   the terrible ones are usually those in which candidates try to do something they are not comfortable with or be something they are not   he warns  if you do choose to submit a video  don t feel like you need a full production studio  he adds  though they have seen great videos that are really well produced  they have also seen equally as effective videos that are really simple  just a one person show with the candidate speaking directly into the camera </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the second essay question  mccombs this year refined its prompt slightly in an effort to encourage applicants to focus their responses on what they hope to achieve while at mccombs  as well as why mccombs is right for them and what they will contribute to their classmates  experience  this is in contrast to last year  when applicants were asked to share what they hope to gain from the texas mba program both personally and professionally  in addition to why mccombs and impact on classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph> with just     words to reply  we realized that we were asking applicants to try to squeeze a lot in there   malta conceded   we want them to really focus on their time here at mccombs   he says of the slight shift  this is also the place to show some mccombs love  he underscores   we bleed burnt orange here in texas   he says   we want to make sure they know this is the right place for them and why  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  mccombs will continue to provide an optional essay where candidates can address anything that may not have been covered elsewhere in their application </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new emphasis on linkedin when the application goes live later this summer  candidates will notice some other changes this year as well  malta says  for starters  the application will place greater emphasis on candidates sharing their linkedin profiles  in the past  as part of the  getting to know you  section of the mccombs application  candidates were invited to share linkedin profiles  any blogs they have and even a pinterest page devoted to why texas mba  this year  those contributions are still welcome  but the invitation to share a linkedin profile has been moved up to right beside where applicants are asked to upload their resume </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants will also have a new option with regard to letters of recommendation  as in the past  recommenders will be able to submit official letters of recommendation directly to the school   this year  though  we will also be asking candidates if they want us to use a recommendation they have on their linkedin profile   malta says  exactly how this will work from an operational standpoint is still being ironed out  so stay tuned for precise details in the application instructions  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the motive behind this shift in terms of recommendation letters is two fold  malta shares   we want to have something that is useable for the applicant even after they go through the application process   he says  a recommendation via linkedin would have the added benefit of helping applicants strengthen their profiles in preparation for their career searches while at mccombs  but the public nature of a linkedin recommendation also stands to benefit the school  malta notes   anything that is out in the public gives us a little more assurance that it is going to be true  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking back at the past year  malta reports that he is very pleased with an increase in both applicant quality and quantity  applications were up between   and    percent  he says  with the majority of growth among domestic applicants  acknowledging that some admitted candidates have yet to decide where they will ultimately enroll  malta is cautiously optimistic about the quality of the incoming class   we know it is a really competitive environment out there  but initial indications are that we will be coming in with a great class profile   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the year ahead  mccombs hopes to build on recent success it has had integrating its first  and second year classes  this year  the school will expand initiatives designed to likewise increase interaction between students in the full time  part time and executive mba programs  orientation activities have been aligned across the different programs to provide greater opportunities for interaction  ways to connect the leadership from the various programs as part of the graduate business council are being considered and several of the school s international trips will be open to students from each of its different programs  malta says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>increased integration of the first  and second year classes  as well as of the students within the school s various mba programs  serves to strengthen the school s network and its reach   when we survey our applicants  we find that one of the biggest reasons they choose to come to texas is because of that longhorn network   says malta   so we are always looking for ways to make sure that those connections are there and alive and as far reaching as they can be  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our thanks to malta for taking time to share these updates with clear admit  stay tuned for our analysis of the mccombs essay questions  as well as further updates on recommendation letters and more when the application goes live later this summer </paragraph>

  <title>why mission matters at mit sloan school of management</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how important is a business school s mission statement to the experience of its students  according to recent graduates of the massachusetts institute of technology  mit  sloan school of management  the school s mission to develop principled  innovative leaders who improve the world and to generate ideas that advance management practice influenced where they chose to attend business school  the experiences they had there and the future path of their careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ricky ashenfelter knew he wanted a school in a market that had a lot of entrepreneurial ventures  which led him to focus his search on san francisco and boston  but more than that  he also wanted a school that valued and would offer coursework tied to energy and sustainability  that narrowed his focus further to mit sloan  the university of california at berkeley s haas school of business and stanford graduate school of business  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what i liked most about sloan was that it was part of a larger mit ecosystem  which was not the case for many business schools   ashenfelter says  and so he left his consulting job at deloitte and headed for boston hoping to find solutions to the problems of food waste in business supply chains </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students drawn to sloan by its mission  the classmates i met from day one were all drawn to mit sloan because of its mission   ashenfelter says   many had motivations to pursue very international  large scale efforts that would change the world from a technology  sustainability or social standpoint  sloan naturally attracted students motivated by that   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to his delight  ashenfelter found that the school s emphasis on entrepreneurship and sustainability gave even more color and maturity to the thoughts and desires encapsulated in the mission  he says   the coursework and extracurricular activities at sloan encourage people to think big and beyond traditional jobs like consulting and finance   he says  of course  many sloanies do go into consulting and finance  he notes   but the time we spend at sloan embeds that kernel or idea around this mission that unifies us as we go out into the world  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before joining sloan  ashenfelter had been part of deloitte s sustainability and energy practice  working with retail and food companies to address challenges from an environmental perspective  having seen the issues of food waste in the supply chain first hand  he came to sloan hoping to explore solutions that he could then take back to a startup or existing business </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i did not necessarily come to sloan with a drive to start my own business   he says  and yet  that s just what happened  through the sloan entrepreneurship   innovation  e i  track  ashenfelter found himself bombarded with case studies  user stories and examples of entrepreneurship that quickly had him thinking he could and should launch his own startup </paragraph>
    <paragraph>together he and fellow sloanie emily malina launched spoiler alert  a mobile application and online platform enabling the real time exchange of surplus  expiring and spoiled food    i came focused on the ideas of food waste and sustainability and she came from the perspective of technology before school  we put our heads together to combine our past experiences to do something with a social and environmental mission that could also produce financial gain   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  malina and ashenfelter met before arriving on campus  at an event for admitted sloan students in the washington  dc  area  they would discover that they d worked just three floors apart from each other in deloitte s dc office  though their paths had never crossed  since ashenfelter worked in the private sector and malina worked in the public sector  doing consulting around technology implementation for government agencies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pair discovered a shared interest in technology and sustainability  and the idea for spoiler alert was born  at sloan  they took several classes together related to their fledgling business  both as part of the e i track and as part of the school s sustainability initiative  a certificate program designed to foster leadership around sustainability issues  these included a venture product marketing course taught by senior lecturer bill aulet  hubspot co founder brian halligan and kayak co founder paul english  as well as classes on technology sales and energy ventures  both also took advantage of the resources of the martin trust center for mit entrepreneurship </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to round out their individual interests  they took a range of courses separately as well and were involved in different extracurricular activities  ashenfelter notes  he was a member of the student led energy club and served as managing director of the mit clean energy prize  a student run business plan competition that distributes more than          to new ventures focused on addressing global energy problems  she was actively involved in the mit     k entrepreneurship competition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>simultaneously  the duo ran a pilot program for spoiler alert from january through march of this year  working with eight massachusetts based food organizations  including the greater boston food bank  as part of the pilot  close to       pounds of food were posted for donation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on friday  ashenfelter and malina both graduated from sloan as part of the class of       they plan to release the spoiler alert app beyond boston and start raising capital  remaining in cambridge to work on the venture full time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and so sloan s mission begins to ripple out into the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>spotlight on unconscious bias another sloan student graduating last friday was similarly impacted by the school s mission  though in very different ways  elena mendez escobar holds a phd in physics and worked at mckinsey for three years before coming to sloan  sponsored by her company   i chose sloan because the sloan alumni i have met were the kind of people i like to work with and had this incredible sense of collaboration   she says   i didn t realize the mission would be so important   she confesses   but so many students and professors here talk about the values and the mission of the school it really made me fall in love with mit sloan   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mendez escobar  a native of spain  transferred to mckinsey s boston office a year before coming to sloan because her physicist husband got a job at mit  she gave birth to her second child just months before enrolling in the mba program  one of the things she found herself thinking about most during her first year as an mba student was the lack of women in leadership positions in business  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i had it in my mind that i wanted to do something about that   she recalls  she remembers hearing an interview with lean in author sheryl sandberg  in which the facebook chief operating officer was asked what companies can do to increase women s leadership  sandberg talked about unconscious bias training   that spoke to me a lot   says mendez escobar  who began doing research around unconscious bias  discovering that it serves as an invisible barrier in developed countries where many of the structural barriers to diversity have been removed </paragraph>
    <paragraph> at sloan  where we have so many future business leaders  i had the thought that if we could have a conversation and really understand these subtle mechanisms and learn the tools necessary to remove these barriers  that could have a huge impact on future companies   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>breaking the mold conference sells out as co chair of the sloan women in management  swim  club  mendez escobar helped spearhead a series of events during the fall of      focused on unconscious bias  leading up to the annual swim conference in february       called breaking the mold  the conference was designed to help students understand what unconscious bias is and develop approaches to managing it in the business world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as an example of unconscious bias  mendez escobar points to research conducted by a recent visiting professor to sloan  modupe akinola  together with other experts in unconscious bias  akinola sent emails to more than       randomly selected professors at american universities  the emails  from fictional prospective students  were identical and written in flawless english  but they featured a range of male and female names  with varying ethnicities  the call back rate in response to these emails  however  was not identical  emails purportedly sent by white males  for instance  were much more likely to receive a response than those sent by asian females  the researchers found </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that is not something these professors were doing on purpose   notes mendez escobar   but there is something in the way we think that gives rise to those kinds of biases   she says  the good news is that recognizing this bias then suggests a very easy intervention to combat it where corporate hiring is concerned  namely having the first resume review be name blind  she points out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the hope with the breaking the mold conference was to draw attention to this type of unconscious bias and help attendees come up with strategies to combat it   when i started thinking about unconscious bias and how to tackle this problem  i never thought the initiative would get as big as it did   mendez escobar says  in all  the events she and swim co founder maria troein helped organize drew more than     people  the conference sold out two weeks before it started and  unprecedented for prior swim conferences  a full third of the attendees were male </paragraph>
    <paragraph>keynote speakers included former mcdonald s president jan fields and sloan alumna robin chase  zipcar founder and buzzcar founder and ceo  the conference also included an interactive workshop called  what policing can teach us about navigating unconscious bias   led by anna laszlo  director of the organization fair and impartial policing  the workshop invited participants to examine unconscious bias in high pressure situations and how to employ techniques to manage biases and the impact they can have on organizations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> maybe i can organize a seminar   i remember thinking   maybe i can organize a seminar    she says  she quickly learned that she could aim much higher  hoping for a team of    to    students to help organize the conference  she was amazed when more than    signed up   that s why we were able to do so many events  because there were so many people interested in it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>encouragement from the sloan administration and students pushed mendez escobar well beyond her initial goals   people kept giving me suggestions of people to reach out to at sloan and in the larger mit community   she says  it was at the urging of the school s administration that she pursued the idea of creating a mini documentary on the subject of unconscious bias  she notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i have never before experienced so much encouragement   she says   in the past  as a woman  i would have an idea and kill it myself before i even took it anywhere   she says  not so at sloan   i was surrounded by people giving me the encouragement to be confident in my own ideas   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one such situation arose when  having scheduled a meeting with the head of mit s department of women and gender studies to discuss how they might work together  she found herself being invited to teach a course on unconscious bias to undergraduates   at the beginning i was completely overwhelmed and said   no  i don t think i m the right person for this    but reminded by the sloan administration that she had plenty of teaching experience while doing her phd and that she had certainly developed an expertise in unconscious bias  she accepted the position   they pushed me to take an opportunity that maybe three years ago i would have refused   she says  it proved to be a wonderful experience  she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these experiences have made mendez escobar one of the biggest proponents of the sloan mission   thanks to sloan s mission  something that was a very small idea has become something very big   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as with ashenfelter and malina s ideas around sustainability and the supply chain  mendez escobar s ideas around unconscious bias are poised to ripple out from mit sloan  she has already been involved with the team at mckinsey that oversees hiring and promoting processes to discuss how they might implement best practices to avoid the unwanted consequences of unconscious bias  she hopes  upon returning to mckinsey  to do the same with the clients with whom she works </paragraph>
    <paragraph> part of why we started this was to help people in their companies after sloan   she says   everyone has a problem finding talent and diversity  and this is something that other companies beyond mckinsey will be interested in knowing more about   she says  especially as research shows that companies with more diverse leadership teams prove to be top financial performers  she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>down the line  she fully intends to stay involved with mit around issues of unconscious bias  if asked  she would gladly continue to teach a class to undergraduates  and she would also be open to developing a workshop with business school students on how to improve processes around hiring and promotion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>given that these mit sloan students represent just a small fraction of the more than     mbas who graduated on friday  imagine how far and in how many different directions the school s mission stands to ripple out from here </paragraph>
    <paragraph>find out how mit sloan s mission statement plays into this year s admissions process </paragraph>

  <title>nyu stern head of admissions offers advice on essays posted today</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>just after new york university  nyu  stern school of business posted its essay questions for the         admissions cycle this morning  assistant dean of mba admissions isser gallogly got on the phone with clear admit to share some advice on what the school is looking for in prospective applicants  responses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern didn t change much this year in terms of its essay prompts  the first  identical to last year  invites applicants to outline their professional aspirations  including why they are pursuing an mba now  what they have done to determine that stern is the best fit for them and what they see themselves doing professionally when they graduate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in answering this question  gallogly urges applicants to demonstrate a clear  well researched career plan as well as first hand knowledge of the stern mba   business school isn t a place to figure out what you want to do   he says   we all know it may change  but you need to come in with a plan   he underscores  he and his team are looking to learn from this essay whether applicants have researched the industries they are targeting or conducted informational interviews to learn as much as they can   we are looking for people who are directed and focused   gallogly says   they need to do their homework before they apply it s in their own best interests  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>likewise  applicants need to do their homework on what differentiates the stern mba program from others  gallogly advises  business school is a huge  irreversible investment          for stern tuition and registration fees alone  to be precise   you only go once  and you want to get it right   he says  noting that the choice you make extends well beyond the two years you ll spend there   this is going to be your network for the rest of your life  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> at a top tier school  it s not about avoiding going wrong because you are not going to go wrong  it s about how right can you go   he says  you want to choose the place where you will thrive  to get a feel for whether stern is that place  gallogly advises applicants to not only completely devour the school website  but also take advantage of the vast array of multimedia and social media resources  online chats and recruiting events around the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>best yet  come to new york   spend the time  spend the money  go visit the schools   he says  to not do so in his mind is like buying a car without taking it for a test drive  not only that  visiting a school provides a great opportunity to make your case about your admission directly to the admissions committee in person  he continues   why wouldn t you take that opportunity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you advance to the interview round in the stern application process  you should definitely plan to come to campus  he adds  though the school does conduct limited offsite interviews in london  china and india  gallogly vastly prefers meeting candidates in new york   it is in candidates  best interests to come and make sure stern is where they want to be   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for its second essay instead of giving applicants a choice between two prompts stern this year served up just one </paragraph>
    <paragraph>personal expression  please describe yourself to your mba classmates  you may use almost any method to convey your message  e g  words  illustrations   feel free to be creative  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the admissions committee chose to move away from the second option  which last year asked applicants  to describe two different paths they could envision their career taking  because they found they got better insight from the personal expression option  feedback also suggested that applicants enjoyed responding to the personal expression prompt more   they feel it gives them the opportunity to convey who they are to the admissions committee in a more creative format   gallogly says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while stern doesn t track what percentage of applicants opt to submit written essays as compared to other forms of communication  it receives a wide range of submissions  gallogly reports   essays are totally fine   he stresses  noting that they receive plenty of those that are wonderful  but they also get videos  collages  recipe books  board games or cereal boxes that applicants have personalized  buildings  sculptures the list goes on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the fine print for the prompt does list some limitations  namely no food or articles of clothing that have been worn   back in the day  there was a classic story of someone who really enjoyed making sushi   gallogly recalls   by the time it showed up to us let s just say it really wasn t putting their best foot forward   over the years  stern has also needed to implement restrictions on size  he says  noting that there was a trend for a while where applicants seemed to be sending in the biggest thing they could think of   it was just a matter of time before a volkswagon showed up   he jokes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern has featured this prompt for several years now because of the valuable insight it gives into emotional quotient  eq    columbia and harvard are now starting to follow suit in terms of this essay   gallogly notes  referring to the  introduce yourself  essay those schools have both introduced in recent years   we have had this a lot longer than they have  but i am glad that other schools are starting to pay attention to how important eq is   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>personal is good too personal  not so much we asked gallogly if there are common pitfalls applicants should try to avoid when sitting down to respond to stern s prompts   sometimes people take it into a space that is a little too casual   he says  while you are encouraged to share personal information  especially in response to the second prompt  make sure it is appropriate for a business setting  he advises  one litmus test is to consider whether what you are writing about is something you would feel comfortable sharing with your boss  if not  probably best to choose another topic   there are some conversations that should not be had on a cell phone on a crosstown bus   he says  and yet  it happens with every application cycle  he adds  don t be that applicant </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  stern again this year offers applicants the opportunity to submit a third optional essay  where they can explain current or past gaps in employment  plans to retake the gmat  gre and or toefl or other relevant information that may not be captured elsewhere in their application  notably  stern also requires applicants who are unable to submit a recommendation from their current supervisor to use essay   to explain why </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  there you have it  our thanks to gallogly for taking time to weigh in </paragraph>

  <title>new courses  boot camps keep kellogg mbas on the cutting edge</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>from the very latest in how to market consumer packaged goods  cpg  to the finer arts of persuasive data visualization  a new series of classes and boot camps at northwestern s kellogg school of management is giving mba students there the tools they need to stay current in the ever evolving world of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kicking things off last month  the kellogg marketing club partnered with cpg giant kraft to offer a day long boot camp designed for first year students preparing for summer gigs with cpg firms  kraft company leaders led the boot camp sessions  which covered topics ranging from channel relationships to nielsen ratings </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the purpose of the boot camp was to give first year students some exposure to concepts that they will encounter in their consumer packaged goods internships  but are not necessarily covered in the first year curriculum   says eric leininger  clinical associate professor of executive education  who directs kellogg s chief marketing officer program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a summer internship is the quickest way to spend    weeks i have ever encountered   said kellogg second year student and marketing club member matt benson  benson worked together with classmate dan rubin willis to help launch the initiative  so that interns could hit the ground running even faster   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to face to face interaction with kraft execs  the boot camp also included an impromptu session led by professor julie hennessy on the best ways to get feedback from a summer internship boss </paragraph>
    <paragraph>based on the success of this year s trial run  students in other industries may benefit from internship primers down the line   we plan to expand this idea to cover the tech and pharma industries next year   leininger said   crash course in consulting  complete with jet lag also new this past spring was an innovative course in which kellogg mba students partnered with students in spain and hong kong to get a taste of what it s really like to be a globetrotting consultant  as part of the new  international growth lab   kellogg students tackle real world problems facing an international business  working alongside students from esade business   law school in barcelona and the hong kong university of science and technology </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through a combination of regular video conferences and travel to work in person with their counterparts around the globe  participating students get to experience the jet setting rhythm of management consulting first hand </paragraph>
    <paragraph> they ll be real consultants  doing a real consulting project  making real recommendations to clients   said harold sirkin  who runs the lab  sirkin  an adjunct professor of strategy at kellogg  is also a senior partner and managing director at the boston consulting group in chicago </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more than just a pretty visualization also on offer for the first time this past spring  a new course entitled  visualization for persuasion  teaches students how to combine empirical evidence  cognitive science  computer science and graphic design to help sell ideas  taught by kellogg professor of leadership and organizational change brian uzzi and associate professor of psychology steven franconeri  the course helps students develop data visualization skills through hands on experience </paragraph>
