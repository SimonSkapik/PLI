  <title>online chat hosted by u penn s wharton school admissions team answers applicants  questions regarding round one interviews</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania yesterday hosted an online chat in which members of its admissions staff answered participants  questions regarding the application process  including wharton s new team based discussion  tbd  interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>round one applicants to wharton learned about the early evening chat in an email invitation that went out yesterday morning  both to applicants who had already been invited to interview and to those still awaiting an invitation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as admissions team members shared during the chat  invitations to interview are not sent out in any particular order  the period to receive an invitation began on october   rd and will continue through november  th  wharton does attempt to prioritize international application notification because of the travel involved  but notifications   including to international applicants   can be sent out at any time  up to and including the very last day of the notification period  the admissions team stressed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once an applicant receives an invitation to interview  he or she can go in and schedule an interview date  only certain interview times have been released to date  as part of an effort by wharton to hold time slots for candidates not invited to interview until later in the invitation period  additional interview times will be released in time  though the admissions team members did not share specifics regarding when </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several participants asked about the new tbd interview  which wharton piloted in previous admissions seasons but has only incorporated as an official part of the admissions process this year  according to the online chat  the tbd interview will be somewhat moderated  but candidates will have a lot of leeway to speak amongst themselves  once candidates confirm an interview date  they will be provided with two prompts to prepare for the tbd  the admissions team advised that candidates should spend about an hour preparing a response to each of the two prompts they receive </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in the team based discussions  we are looking for how you interact with a group of your peers to work on a real life business scenario   replied an admissions committee member to one of the questions posed during the online chat   however  we are not looking for any one specific answer to the prompts   it is more about how you engage with your group and solve the problem together   just as you will do in our classrooms  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during the online chat  wharton s admissions team shared that the tbd topics will be the same for all round one interviews  and applicants will be asked one of the two questions as part of the group discussion  the tbd topics will likely change for round two  the team members shared </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the in person element of wharton s application process will include both the tbd and a       minute one on one discussion  much of the format of the one on one discussion will be determined by the interviewer  in some  applicants may be asked to share their opinions of the tbd  this component is also intended to offer candidates an opportunity to ask questions they may have about their candidacy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a few final points that came out of yesterday s chat    applicants who have scheduled their interview dates can change them if necessary  but they must give up their current slot before being able to sign up for an alternate interview time    applicants who do not receive an invitation to interview by the end of the notification period on november  th will receive notification at that time that their application process is complete    the percentage of applicants wharton expects to invite to interview on average is    to    percent  but actual numbers will depend on the strength of the overall pool    final decisions regarding round one will be released on december   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck to all of you preparing to interview at wharton or awaiting an invitation  as always  remember that the clear admit wiki is a great place to share your wharton interview experiences and learn from those of others </paragraph>

  <title>business school admissions officers uncertain regarding new gmat integrated reasoning section  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as many current business school applicants prepare for the first time to submit gmat scores that include the newly launched integrated reasoning  ir  section  business schools are expressing uncertainty about the ways in which the new section may or may not have improved the entrance exam  according to a recent survey conducted by kaplan test prep </paragraph>
    <paragraph>noting that it is too early to pass judgment on the new section  kaplan this week released survey findings that suggest that business schools may not be as positive about the new section this year   now that it has launched   as they were in recent years when it was still in development </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in kaplan s      survey     percent of responding business school admissions officers said ir would make the gmat more reflective of the business school experience  down from    percent in kaplan s      survey  more admissions officers      percent   responded that they weren t sure if the new section would make the exam more reflective  this figure was up from    percent the year before  of admissions officers polled  only   percent last year said the new ir section would not make the exam more reflective  that figure rose to    percent in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>asked whether the new section will make the exam more reflective of work in business and management after business school     percent responded  do not know   compared to    percent who said yes and    percent who said no </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  how important will the ir scores be in the evaluation process at business schools  uncertainty dominates here  with    percent of respondents saying they are undecided at this point  twenty two percent responded that ir scores will be important  and    percent said they will not be </paragraph>
    <paragraph> schools generally prefer to gather performance data on a new test or test section before fully incorporating it into their evaluation process   andrew mitchell  director of pre business programs for kaplan test prep  said in a statement   not all applicants in      will submit gmat scores with an ir component  we can expect that  as more data is available  schools will determine clear policies  in which integrated reasoning may play a key role  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mitchell cautioned that gmat test takers should not  however  take the ir section any less seriously than the other sections in the meantime </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kaplan polled     business school admissions officers   including    from the nation s top    mba programs as ranked by u s  news   world report   for this survey by telephone between august and september      </paragraph>

    <paragraph>this year marks the   th anniversary of harvard business school  hbs  s first female class of mbas  and students earlier this month kicked off a yearlong celebration with an event sponsored by the hbs women s student association  wsa   among the things to celebrate  according to an article recounting the event in harvard gazette  is the fact that women have grown from a mere eight members of that initial co ed class to represent    percent of the current mba program </paragraph>

    <paragraph>moon noted that the school will mark the milestone  not by congratulating ourselves on a job well done  but rather by using the opportunity to explore the issues and challenges that women continue to face in business and in the world at large   according to the harvard gazette article   the truth is we ve come a long way  but we are not by any measure where we need to be   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>spar  a former junior faculty member at hbs  addressed a crowd made up largely of women  sharing her perspective of modern feminism   we inherited a set of expectations that  at the moment  are actually dooming us to failure   she said  in addition to her time at hbs and now as head of an all female college  she also serves as a board member for investment firm goldman sachs  experiences she drew on for her speech  as well as a recent newsweek cover story and a new book she is writing due out next fall </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit facebook contest winner reports back on kaplan gmat prep course</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last spring  in anticipation of the current mba admissions cycle  we featured a contest on facebook in which participants had the chance to win a kaplan gmat classroom  anywhere course to help them prepare to take the gmat business school entrance exam  one lucky winner   ebony brooks   snagged the prize  a nine session virtual prep course featuring access to       practice problems  nine cat exams and more than     hours of practice and instruction </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brooks  a pr manager in atlanta  ga  signed up for and completed the course over the summer  we caught up with her last week to hear her thoughts on the class  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kaplan s gmat classroom  anywhere course is held in a virtual classroom  featuring a live video feed to an instructor and teaching assistants  during online class meetings  students can ask questions and interact with their instructor and fellow students using the chat  polling and screen sharing functions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brooks praised the structure of the course  the quality of the teaching and the flexibility of the online delivery model   i was really impressed with the actual virtual classroom   she said   i didn t take a lot of online classes during undergrad so i was a little nervous taking a class in a virtual way  but it was very accessible   she liked being able to log into her own personal account  see her professor and communicate with other students via chat  she noted that the professor and ta were very accessible both in and out of class  replying to follow up questions promptly each time she contacted them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>asked what she might have changed about the course  she said that she would have liked it to include more time for students to do problems together in real time   i get that the purpose was to allow you to do it on your own  but i have come to learn that everyone thinks differently  there were many times in class where two or three people would approach the problem in a different way and arrive at the same answer  i found that very helpful  so i would have liked more time to go through problems   especially quantitative problems   that way  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she appreciated the fact that the course featured sections focused on each portion of the gmat  including the test s newly added integrated reasoning section  for brooks personally  the sections on math were especially important  since many of those skills are not ones she uses currently in her daily job as a pr manager for a healthcare firm </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thrilled to win her course and get to complete it for free  brooks did say that she thinks it s a great value at        i think it is worth the money  and i think it is a cost effective offering   she said  she added that she would consider taking supplemental courses offered by kaplan to continue honing the skills she ll need to be successful on the gmat </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brooks is planning to take the gmat this spring  leaving time to take it again if necessary before completing applications by the middle of next year  she hopes to stay in atlanta for a part time mba program that would allow her to continue working at her current job  her top choice is emory university s goizueta business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we wish her luck on the gmat and in her application process </paragraph>

  <title>american  british schools draw fewer overseas students  economist reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>immigration policies in the united states and great britain are making it less appealing for students from other countries to pursue mbas there  even though they are home to some of the best mba programs in the world  according to a report this week in the economist </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in       america educated    percent of the world s mbas  a sharp reduction from the    percent it claimed in       the economist reports  even in absolute terms  the number has shrunken from         to          one of the greatest contributing factors is how difficult it is for students from overseas to obtain a work visa for after graduation  according to the economist  even highly skilled foreigners  like mba graduates  typically wait a decade for a green card </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in britain  meanwhile  students from outside the european union are getting squeezed even more  in its efforts to reduce net immigration  the conservative party has made the application process to receive student visas significantly more difficult  the economist reports  it also has made it much more difficult for non europeans to work in the u k  upon graduation   requiring an immediate sponsoring company and minimum starting salary   and is refusing to allow students to bring their spouses or children with them when they study  enrollment numbers have taken a hit as a result  the economist points out  noting that british business schools were down    percent over the past year according to its own recent mba rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but with their tighter immigration policies  the united states and britain are the ones who stand to suffer  the economist piece argues  the schools lose out on tuition from foreign students  native born students lose out on the valuable opportunity to mix with bright people from elsewhere and truly understand the globalized world  and foreign students are less likely to forge connections that could lead to future business between their home countries and the u s  and u k </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  the economist points out  other countries   including canada  australia and china   are stepping up to welcome the bright students america and britain are turning away  they are doing so by reducing restrictions  undercutting tuition costs and improving standards </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the economist piece closed with this bit of advice   the world is engaged in a war for mobile talent  nations that refuse to take part will lose  the good news is that the most potent weapon costs nothing at all  it is a welcome mat  </paragraph>

  <title>two business school professors receive nobel prize in economics</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last week  a professor of economics and business administration at harvard business school  hbs  and a professor emeritus at the university of california at los angeles  ucla  were named joint winners of the nobel prize in economic sciences  the two were awarded for their theoretical work in market matching and how it can be improved to create better matches  for example  between students and the schools want to attend and between organ donors and recipients </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lloyd shapley of ucla developed a theory of  matching methods  for how to best to match people up in large groups  together with colleague david gale  he developed a process for ensuring that those matches are as stable as possible  which came to be known as the  gale shapley algorithm   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>years later  hbs s alvin roth  now a visiting professor at stanford  developed ways to apply shapley s theory to the admissions process for public schools in new york and boston and used it to match compatible kidney donors with recipients for the new england program for kidney exchange  which he co founded </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the combination of shapley s basic theory and roth s empirical investigations  experiments and practical design has generated a flourishing field of research and improved the performance of many markets   the nobel committee said in its announcement awarding what is formally known as the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the two professors will share      million in prize money from the royal swedish academy of sciences </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit cofounder tapped to moderate graduate management admissions council global symposium panel</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the graduate management admissions council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmat exam and conducts wide ranging research related to graduate management education  recently asked clear admit ceo and cofounder graham richmond to moderate a panel as part of its global symposia  an annual event series in europe and asia designed to give global audiences of admissions professionals insight into current topics and trends in graduate management education </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this year s gmac european conference  held last week in london  spotlighted student motivations and expectations as they relate to graduate management education   specifically with regard to studying in europe during the current financial crisis  the session began with gmac research about candidate motivations   what drives today s applicants to pursue an mba or related master s degree  what their expectations are from the degree and who influences them over the course of the admissions process   presented by michelle sparkman renz  gmac director of research communications  research and development </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the session went on to provide participants with multiple perspectives on the topic  including richmond s own insight as an admissions consultant to prospective applicants to top tier mba programs  as moderator  richmond also posed related questions to a panel of alumni from esade business school  rotterdam school of management  rsm  and cass business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the symposium was really interesting and had attendees from virtually all of the leading institutions in europe  including london business school  london school of economics  esade  ie  imd  hec  oxford  cambridge and rsm   richmond recounts   the way the panel session was constructed allowed gmac s sparkman renz to speak about admissions trends at the macro level  with a focus on europe  and the alumni to speak at the very micro level about their own experiences   i slotted in between those two vantage points offering observations from the clear admit perspective  since we see hundreds of top tier focused candidates each year and have been experts in this space for more than    years  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac will host a similar event next month in singapore  the gmac asia pacific conference  this forum  also focused on candidate motivations and expectations  will take a closer look at how they are shaped by the current global economy and regional economies in asia pacific </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>amid increasing application volume for one year mba programs  chicago area business schools   including northwestern s kellogg school of management   are reallocating resources toward accelerated programs  according to a recent report in crain s chicago business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applications to kellogg s one year mba jumped by   percent this past year  and the school is increasing its one year class to     from     with plans to add an additional    spots in       crain s reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we ll shrink our two year program roughly in line with the growth of our one year program   betsy ziegler  associate dean of mba programs and dean of students at kellogg  told crain s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the crain s story cited recent figures out of the graduate management admissions council  gmac  showing that    percent of schools offering one year mba programs reported an increase in applications for classes starting in       gmac reports that only    percent of two year programs saw an increase for the same time period </paragraph>
    <paragraph>shorter programs have potential benefits for both students and universities  according to the crain s article  for students  they provide an opportunity to gain expertise without sacrificing two years  salary   and they often come at a reduced price  for example  the one year program at kellogg is          compared to          for the two year mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>universities  meanwhile  like larger application pools because they can lead to higher quality students  and they can earn more over a two year period if more students come through a shorter program  crain s reports </paragraph>

  <title>u penn s wharton school shares details of new team based discussion admissions component</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>applicants to the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania recently received an email from the admissions office sharing details about a new evaluation method it will use as part of the         application cycle   the team based discussion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants who are invited to interview will now take part in a team based discussion with five to six other applicants during a scheduled session   our hope is that this will give applicants a glimpse into wharton s group learning dynamic   which is central to our program   read the email   we believe that this type of assessment also serves as a tool to take prospective students  off the page  and allows us to see firsthand the ways in which they can contribute to our community of diverse learners and leaders  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the email  the group discussion  is additive and does not replace the opportunity for an individual exchange   time will be allotted for applicants to have a short one on one conversation regarding their candidacy with the interviewer  during which time they can ask any questions they may have </paragraph>
    <paragraph>who will conduct the group discussions and short one on one conversations will depend upon where a candidate chooses to interview  interviews on campus will be conducted by trained second year students known as admissions fellows  off campus interviews  which will be held this year in dubai  london  mexico city  mumbai  new delhi  san francisco  sao paulo  seoul  shanghai  singapore and tokyo  will be facilitated by admissions staff members </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once a candidate is invited to interview  he or she will be able to schedule an in person session through his or her wharton account   either on campus or in an interview hub city   while there are two options and no one way is preferred over another  we do encourage invited candidates to interview on campus to get a sense of our community and culture   read the email   we will not be able to accommodate all requests for a specific location  so we encourage all invited candidates to register for a slot as soon as possible   it continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of the format of the team based discussion  each will have a prompt and a purpose  and participants are expected to work toward a tangible outcome with their group  the email provided the following examples of prompts that might be used </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  what one talent or strength should a leader rely on most in daily life    if you could teach one thing about innovation to a group of new employees  what would it be </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants will receive more detail about the prompt for their discussion after they sign up for an interview session  according to the email </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  the email advised applicants to spend no more than an hour preparing for the discussion  to come prepared to share individual thoughts and not to expect feedback from the interviewer   be careful to avoid any interpretation of verbal or non verbal communication  as both may mislead you   the message cautioned </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck to applicants preparing to take part in this new evaluation method at wharton  remember  the clear admit wiki is a great place to share your first hand experiences with the team based discussion and to learn from those of others </paragraph>

    <paragraph>an article last week in bloomberg businessweek reported on wordprom com  founded by gili and ori elkin  a husband and wife team who graduated with mbas from stanford and haas respectively  in lieu of selling a collection of successful essays compiled as a book  as has been done in the past  the elkins since august have been gathering essays from recent mba graduates and current students and began selling them via their website about two weeks ago  according to bloomberg bw </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler featured in article on harvard business school s application changes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>marking yesterday s round one application deadline at harvard business school  hbs   poets quants today ran an article asking admissions consultants how the applicants they worked with on this year s application to hbs felt about the school s move to reduce its required essays from four to two  according to the p q report  between    and    percent of candidates to harvard are estimated to work with a consultant during their application process  making consultants a good gauge of market reaction to the changes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the majority of admissions consultants polled by p q reported frustration on the part of their clients about the new application format  in which applicants have a total of just     words to answer two direct questions  namely   tell us something you ve done well  and  tell us something you wish you had done better   according to several consultants  applicants felt like the change didn t allow them the opportunity to fully tell their story or  fan out all their feathers  as one put it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit senior admissions counselor stacey oyler had a different view   i think that the clients took the changes in stride   she told p q   after the initial surprise  they focused on sharpening their message and telling their stories with the two essays and their resume  it took some fine tuning  but i think most are happy with the applications they crafted  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs is one of several top business schools that have moved to lessen the role of essays in the application process in recent years  mit sloan school of management and stanford graduate school of business each require fewer essay responses from their applicants this year  and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania this season is rolling out a new group interview portion of the application to provide its admissions committee with an opportunity to see applicants interact with other applicants as part of the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to hbs dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold  the move at hbs comes in part because the essays had become too large a part of the admissions process   i ve been saying that admissions is not an essay writing contest and that is where a lot of the anxiety is   leopold told p q   when we never met anyone  essays were the only way we had for applicants to get some form of personalization of the application  but since the class of       we ve been interviewing all admitted applicants  the interviews are a big investment of our time  money and assessment energy  so i think it s time to have a corresponding reduction in that initial  essay  hurdle  </paragraph>

  <title>demand for management education edges up despite decreased volume for two year programs in the u s   gmac reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>overall demand for graduate business and management programs around the world grew slightly last year  although two thirds of two year mba programs in the united states reported declines in application volume  according to the most recent survey from the graduate management admissions council  gmac   which owns the gmat exam </paragraph>

    <paragraph> there is greater demand that business schools today offer specialized and flexible programs to meet corporate and student needs   gmac president and ceo david wilson said in a statement   worldwide  these diverse graduate management programs are drawing different kinds of students   he continued  adding that technology has helped some schools meet increasingly varied demand  as has flexibility in delivery mode   the message students and companies are sending is clear  one size does not necessarily fit all   wilson added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac s annual survey shows application changes at the program level this year over last  finding that specialized master s programs showed growth for the fifth straight year and that worldwide  full time two year mba programs appear to be stabilizing despite continued decreased application volume among these programs in the united states  full time  two year mba programs in asia pacific showed significant growth  with    percent reporting application increases </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler featured in article on business school admissions staffers turned admissions consultants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stacey oyler  a senior admissions counselor here at clear admit who came to us from the admissions office at dartmouth s tuck school of business  was recently featured prominently in a poets quants article about that very topic   namely  former admissions committee members at top mba programs who become admissions consultants to prospective mba applicants  the article ran today on the p q website  as well as on the cnn money and fortune websites </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the article indicates  oyler worked on the tuck admissions committee for two years  from october      to july       participating in every admissions decision for two full classes as part of a process that involved reviewing applications in a locked room with seven colleagues until they reached unanimous decisions of whether to admit  deny or waitlist  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you got a little crazy locked in that room   oyler laughingly told p q   i remember we had a major debate over whether a military candidate actually flew a plane or was merely on the plane  you couldn t tell for sure from his application   in the end  they picked up the phone and called the applicant to find out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after her tenure at tuck  oyler spent another three years as an mba recruiter for mckinsey   co  before joining clear admit  those combined experiences make her a valuable asset to our admissions consultant team  both for applicants who seek her first hand knowledge of tuck s mba program and admissions process as well as for those who simply want help from a passionate and talented professional in the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i know people think i went to the dark side when i became a consultant   oyler told p q   but i don t do this for the money  i like working with people  i m just a coach  but i love what i do  it s fun  and i m not cheating  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  as the article goes on to point out  oyler is one of dozens of former admissions officials who have transitioned to the role of consultant  in addition to oyler  with her tuck background  clear admit s team also includes consultants with experience working in the admissions offices of the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and the university of chicago booth school of business  among others </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while the piece rightly suggests that an admissions stint isn t a requirement for being a top notch admissions consultant  here at clear admit we are pleased that oyler s experience complements that of our other team members and vice versa </paragraph>

  <title>admissions insiders advise prospective mba applicants to ask their own questions during the interview</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in preparing for the questions they may be asked as part of an mba admissions interview  prospective applicants would do well to formulate a few intelligent questions of their own  according to admissions deans from top mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the questions that an mba candidate asks as part of the interview can make the difference that leads to an acceptance letter  according to a recent column in u s  news by dr  don martin  a former admissions dean at columbia  northwestern and the university of chicago booth school of business  among other schools  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>christine sneva  director of admissions and financial aid at cornell university s johnson school of management  agreed with martin s thesis   it s a chance for candidates to show they ve made the effort to dig a little deeper  that they care and have genuine interest in our program and faculty research   sneva told him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at johnson  where students are encouraged to develop relationships with faculty  sneva is particularly impressed when prospective applicants pose questions that reflect the fact that they have taken time to identify the research and teaching of individual professors  but even simple questions can make a good impression  she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i like it when a candidate asks about the facilities such as the library  student center and academic buildings   she told martin   it seems simple  but it shows that the candidate is picturing his or herself here  and that s important to us  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his column  martin revealed that while an admissions dean  he regularly sought feedback from interviewers about the types of questions applicants asked   it provided insight into what the candidate was thinking and what is important to him or her about an mba education   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martin goes on to recommend five types of questions candidates should ask  first  ask a question based on something you read in a brochure or on the school website  he suggests   this demonstrates due diligence and indicates time well spent researching that mba program   he writes  second  ask why the interviewer decided to become part of the respective school   whether it s a student  alumnus or admissions staff representative  this is a great way to engage your interviewer and seek firsthand knowledge of what makes the school special   he advises </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martin s other suggested questions include what the interviewer considers to be the school or program s greatest asset  what three adjectives he or she would use to describe the school and what advice the interviewer might have to offer   this may be the most important question to ask   martin says  noting that it s also a good closing question   don t hesitate to ask the interviewer for the one piece of advice he or she would give you as a student at that school   he adds  in doing so  you are tapping into the experience and insight of someone who knows the mba program well while also demonstrating openness to feedback </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business admissions office won t focus on integrated reasoning gmat scores until next year</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the launch of the new integrated reasoning  ir  section of the graduate management admissions test  gmat  should not be a cause of worry for prospective mba applicants  according to a recent post on the stanford mba admissions blog  the admissions team there doesn t plan to focus on scores for the new section until it has had more of a chance to determine how to evaluate them </paragraph>
    <paragraph> rest assured that ir is new to us  too  and it s going to take us  and our peer schools  some time before we know how to interpret it as it relates to the stanford mba program   writes stanford associate director of mba admissions allison davis   what we do know is that the test was designed to provide insight into how you pull together knowledge from different sources something you probably do already at work  and will certainly do here at stanford  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for this application year  stanford mba admissions will see your ir score if you have taken the new gmat  but they will focus on the verbal  quantitative  awa and total scores  according to davis   once we have had the chance to review ir scores in this first year  we will determine how to evaluate them in our process for next year   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>davis went on to remind prospective applicants that no one score or section of a test is decisive in the stanford mba admissions process  the school has no cut offs and requires no minimum or maximum score   we look for indicators of your academic ability throughout your whole application  and a test score is only one data point in a much larger picture   says davis </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she added that prospective applicants who have not taken the new gmat also shouldn t worry   scores from the earlier test are valid for   years and her team doesn t have a preference about when you take your test   and we accept both the gmat and the gre  and we don t play favorites    she states </paragraph>

    <paragraph>a recent article in bloomberg businessweek suggests that more top u s  business schools are sending their admissions teams out on the road to more cities across the country in an effort to combat flagging applicant volume  but just as they provide important recruiting opportunities for schools  admissions events also give prospective applicants a valuable means of getting to know more about programs they are interested in while obtaining a first hand impression of the people and culture that make each school unique </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a current student at the university of chicago booth school of business who has worked with that school s admissions office since matriculating suggests that prospective applicants shouldn t worry too much about how they are being evaluated during these events   as a student who has been very involved with admissions events for the past year  i now know that these events are for you  the prospective students   wrote beth mcnamee in a recent post to the booth experience student blog   we want to give you a chance to get to know the school  ask questions and figure out if booth is the right fit for you  the best thing you can do is relax  learn  enjoy the free food and yourself   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in her post  mcnamee revealed that she was so nervous attending her first admissions event that she almost missed it entirely  after several minutes of small talk with two friendly women at the bar where the event was supposed to take place  she asked if they had just finished their first year  only to be met with blank stares   turns out  they were just two random friendly young women at the bar  in my nervousness  i had not even made it to the event  which was just across the room   mcnamee said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her greatest regret looking back at the application process was not having more fun during this part of it  to prospective applicants just getting started she made some useful suggestions  for one  make some notes after the event of things that were interesting and relevant to you   they could be subjects to discuss with your interviewer  second  if you connect with someone during the event  don t hesitate to ask for their email and follow up   generally  i find that students and alumni are happy to talk offline   she wrote   i m even meeting up this weekend with an alum i met during the application process  </paragraph>

  <title>one year mba  two year mba  pros and cons</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>preference for one year mba programs   common at european business schools  but traditionally less so at u s  schools   is growing among prospective u s  and canadian applicants  according to an article this week in the wall street journal  lean economic times make the benefits of shorter programs  including lower tuition and less time and earnings lost while studying  appealing  but the wsj article argues that these accelerated options may carry other costs that students considering them should bear in mind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in          percent of u s  and canadian respondents to a survey by business education research company qs quacquarelli symonds ltd  preferred programs lasting    to    months  the wsj reports  this year  that figure fell to    percent  meanwhile  preference for programs lasting between    and    months rose  up to    percent of respondents from    percent in       some u s  schools are responding to this increased demand  such as northwestern s kellogg school of management  which announced earlier this year that it plans to double the size of its one year option   check out our admissions director q a with kellogg s kate smith for more on this  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other schools believe that the drawbacks of one year mba programs outweigh their benefits  according to the wsj report   thinking that you can learn all the basics of management in just one year is simply impossible   jordi canals  dean at university of navarra s iese business school in spain  told the wsj  he maintains that it takes at least seven or eight months just to learn the fundamentals of business  iese offers only a two year program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg requires students in its one year mba program to come in having already studied fundamental business courses so that they are ready for higher level courses  electives and club activities  betsy ziegler  kellogg associate dean of mba programs and dean of students  told the wsj </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but that doesn t address the issue of the summer internship  an integral part of two year mbas  the wsj article points out  many top firms make the majority of their associate hires through their internship programs  leaving students in one year mba programs at a significant disadvantage </paragraph>

  <title>the evolving relationship between admissions consultants and business school admissions officers</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit co founder graham richmond was featured in a bloomberg businessweek article this week about the relationship between mba admissions consultants and top business schools  though the article quotes some school officials who say they are wary of consultants who may  help too much   it does point to efforts by reputable admissions consultants such as clear admit to promote ethical standards and protocols in the admissions consulting process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  clear admit s richmond was a founding member six years ago of the association of international graduate admissions consultants  aigac   which requires members to adhere to a set of principles for good practice  and he sees a clear trend toward stronger and stronger relationships between admissions consultants and top business programs  as evidenced by the growing number of schools that have hosted aigac conferences on their campuses  those schools   which total    to date   include the kellogg school of management  aigac conference        columbia business school  aigac conference        harvard business school  aigac conference       and the mit sloan school of management  aigac conference        just to name a few  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  representatives from more    schools have attended and or participated in aigac panel discussions and other events  and as richmond pointed out in the bloomberg bw piece  more and more admissions directors are giving interviews to clear admit and other consultancies than was the case a decade ago  we will feature interviews with admissions directors at more than two dozen top schools as part of our current admissions director q a series  which we will be releasing over the course of the next two months </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i am not suggesting that these programs all  recommend  that applicants use an admissions consultant   richmond says   having said that  the fact that they have all opened up their campuses to aigac conferences and or traveled to our events to serve on panels suggests that they recognize the need to work with us and are seeking open lines of communication   he continued  he also noted that top programs also recognize that aigac consultants reach tens of thousands of top tier applicants each year  representing a valuable marketing channel </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so though some may still characterize the relationship between admissions consultants and business schools as chilly  those of us here at clear admit  take heart in knowing that admissions directors at top programs increasingly recognize the valuable role ethical consultants can play for prospective applicants as part of the admissions process </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit featured in financial times article on changing mba admissions</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit s own graham richmond was featured as part of an article this week in the financial times about changes taking place this admissions season at several top business schools  the article  entitled  the creative route to an mba   highlighted the shift at several top mba programs toward requiring fewer essays from applicants  among other changes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several top schools  including harvard business school  hbs   stanford graduate school of business and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania  will require applicants to submit fewer essays as part of the application process than in years past  clear admit s richmond told the ft that he believes this is part of a trend by top programs to shift emphasis away from the essays and toward the interview portion of the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>admissions directors at hbs and stanford acknowledge declined emphasis on the essay portion of the application process   i think and i ve said this before  this isn t an essay writing contest   hbs managing director for admissions dee leopold told the ft  derrick bolton  mba admissions director at stanford  thinks a shift toward fewer essays is just the beginning   schools are finally beginning to catch up with the world around them  i think you ll see a lot more changes in the next four or five years   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to richmond s point that schools are putting greater emphasis instead on the interview  hbs this year will invite candidates who interview to submit a memo reflecting on that interview within    hours  wharton  meanwhile  will introduce a group interview for the first time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the ft report  school officials maintain that the changes are designed to better match generation y applicants  though there is some speculation that they may also be part of an effort to combat the application volume drop off that many schools have seen in recent years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the application process may not be the only aspect of the mba program to face change  though some top schools argue that a one year mba degree isn t sufficient to cover the required curriculum and lacks the important summer internship  other schools have begun to recognize that application volume among one year programs is on the rise  kellogg  one of the few top u s  programs that has both one  and two year programs  reports that applications to the one year program have increased by    to    percent over the past two years  while those to the two year program have fallen by almost as much  according to the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in this economy  where candidates are a bit more roi conscious  they may think a one year program is enough for what they need   richmond told the ft </paragraph>

  <title>business schools fail to track whether social networking yields applicants  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>though the overwhelming majority of top business schools use social networks like twitter  facebook and linkedin to promote their programs  far fewer actually follow through to determine which social media interactions yield applications  according to a recent university of massachusetts dartmouth study </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the study found that a whopping    percent of the    surveyed business schools promote themselves on twitter  and    percent do so on linkedin  u s  news reports  but of those schools  which were selected for their top u s  news rankings     percent don t track whether social media interactions actually yield applications  the survey found  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> they are heavily involved in social media and they think they re doing a hell of a job  and in reality they re not ever tracking these people these thousands and thousands of people coming to their facebook page   to see if they become applicants   nora ganim barnes  director of umass dartmouth s center for marketing research  told u s  news  barnes  who conducted the study with stephanie jacobsen  the former mba coordinator at the university s charlton college of business  called the findings a  wake up call  for business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business school applicants  meanwhile  should look at social media interactions as a means of collecting information about schools  but not as a way to improve their chances of admissions  sarah ramsey  director of mba recruitment and admissions at the university of california at irvine s merage school of business  told u s  news  the school doesn t formally account for those types of interactions  she says   but candidates are being observed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the umass dartmouth study did find that schools value social networking  with    percent maintaining an official mba blog and    percent reporting plans to invest more in social media in the next year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even if it can t increase your chances of getting in  umass s barnes recommends using the portals as a means of networking before getting to campus   once you get there to be able to say   hi i m charlie  we had that discussion   i think it opens doors   she told u s  news </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>late last week  wharton vice dean karl t  ulrich reported that wharton would adopt a team based discussion as part of its           application process   this new method of applicant evaluation was piloted during round   of the previous admissions cycle and with current mba students at the wharton school last year  it will be an addition to the current one on one interview  not a replacement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to ulrich s official announcement </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>mba students at new york university s stern school of business increasingly are taking advantage of opportunities to travel the globe and put some of the things they are learning into practice to shape social policy  according to a recent article in the financial times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more than     stern students participated in the stern consulting corps  scc  program this past year  and applications to the scc program rose     percent this spring compared with last year  the ft reports  scc began    years ago as a program placing students with local non profits for    week project engagements  this year  for the first time  the program expanded to include projects in emerging markets linked to faculty research </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one such project involved a dozen mba students traveling to india to work with arun sundararajan  stern associate professor of information  operations and management sciences  to analyze the impact of india s unique identity project  a government sponsored initiative to help provide every indian citizen with a unique    digit id number  without some form of identification  much of india s population cannot apply for bank accounts  obtain mobile phones or receive government subsidies for food and education  among other things </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s a moon shot project   sundararajan told the ft    it s having a transformative impact on the lives of hundreds of millions of people   he added  noting that about     million citizens who did not have a portable id will have one by the end of the year  participation provides stern students with an opportunity to understand in tangible ways the power business has to transform society  according to sundararajan   it s one thing to be exposed to examples of this in a textbook  it s another to witness it first hand   he told the ft </paragraph>

  <title>admissions tip  using rankings to your advantage</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>there are numerous sources that can knowledgeably rank the  top  mba programs   however  because business schools receive different rankings depending on the sources  criteria  it can be difficult to understand which are the  best  schools   therefore today we d like to talk about how b school applicants can use rankings to discover the  best  schools for them   although the general merits of each school are important  we also believe that it is important for mba applicants to rank schools based on their individual needs and interests   therefore we encourage students to use official mba school rankings in the following ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   use rankings to create a consensus   sources rarely have the exact same rankings as each other  and therefore trying to determine the  top five  schools can be frustrating   however  it s best to compile these different sources of rankings to form a consensus regarding the top schools   for example  if your target program is consistently listed in the top     regardless of its individual ranking among different sources  you should feel confident that it is regarded as a top school by industry professionals and future employers   you may not be able to pinpoint the ultimate  number one  school  but you will be able to distinguish between the different tiers of schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   consider individual rankings   mba applicants should assess schools based on how they will help them gain what they want from their business school experiences   therefore we urge you to ask yourself what matters most to you in an mba program   some applicants may value strict adherence to the case method more than the amount or size of research centers  whereas other applicants may want a large number of diverse student organizations or a strong joint degree program   looking at the individual criteria from which rankings are calculated may help you judge business schools based on the specific factors that matter most to you   for example  if you are interested in entrepreneurship  then perhaps you should consider applying to an mba program with a strong program in this field  even if it receives lower scores in other areas especially if these areas are not a main concern for you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>    think about where you want to go after business school   in addition to considering what you want to get out of your business school experience  you should think about how business school will help you pursue your future career   therefore  some important rankings to consider may be the number of internships students gain at a particular mba program or how many recruiters from different fields visit specific campuses   these rankings may be especially important if you need to follow a specific career path to achieve your career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to studying rankings  we encourage b school applicants to do further research in understanding the comparable merits of business schools  such as perusing admissions information  talking to professors and students  and visiting campuses   furthermore  we encourage applicants to check out our clear admit school guides  which offer detailed profiles of the leading mba programs   best of luck to those researching business schools </paragraph>

  <title>forte foundation extends initiative to increase women on corporate boards</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this summer  the forte foundation extended to the united states an initiative originally launched in europe to increase the number of women serving on corporate boards   qualified board ready women do exist  and we are using our unique relationship with u s  business schools to make these accomplished individuals visible to decision makers   elissa ellis sangster  forte executive director  said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in late june  forte   a consortium of corporations  business schools and nonprofits focused on directing talented women toward positions of leadership in business   asked each of its    u s  mba partner schools to supply at least five board ready women  an earlier collaboration between forte  its five european business school members and the european commission yielded a repository of       vetted and board ready women culled from school alumnae  faculty and staff members </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the success of the european initiative inspired forte to expand its call for board ready women to the united states  forte plans to release a separate list of u s  based board ready women at the end of this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the european schools have done  u s  member schools will identify a point of contact to reach out to the full list of board ready women from each institution  forte also will consider self nominations from its membership of        professional women </paragraph>
    <paragraph> as the only organization that unites top business schools around the topic of women in business  we consider it our responsibility to take concrete steps to promote gender parity in corporate boardrooms   sangster said in a statement  forte announced the expansion of the initiative to the united states at its annual sponsor meeting in los angeles on june   th  the event included a panel entitled   corporate boards  where are the women  </paragraph>

  <title>former insead dean shares his plans for cambridge s judge business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last year  the former dean of insead s phd program left that school to become director of the judge business school at the university of cambridge  in an interview published this week in the financial times  christoph loch talks about the differences between the schools and his hopes and plans in his new role at judge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>german born loch told the ft that he thinks that the    year old judge business school is about two thirds of the way towards becoming an institution that will truly rival the ivy leagues   the rule of thumb is that it takes    years to build a top business school   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>judge currently has    faculty  and loch has a goal of growing that to    in the medium term  he does not have aspirations to transform judge into an insead  with campuses in three different parts of the world      faculty and       students per class  he told the ft   the biggest business schools are not necessarily the best   he said   we will never have       mbas  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  it was the many ways in which judge is different from insead that attracted him to his new position  he says   part of the reason i came is that you can do things as part of a great university that a stand alone business school cannot do   he told the ft   we need to build on those  university  assets  the strategy is simply different from a standalone school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>over the course of the next    years  loch hopes to build a research based school focused around the  cambridge phenomenon    the cluster of high tech start ups that have become part of the university town  a tech specialist himself  he hopes to work with organizations within that cluster to help judge develop its research acumen   specifically by investigating issues that are important to the high tech companies themselves </paragraph>

  <title>words of wisdom from business school deans and directors</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an article this week in forbes compiled messages given to the graduating business school class of      by deans and directors at some of the top mba programs  including harvard business school  uva s darden school of business  nyu stern  dartmouth s tuck school of business and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not surprisingly  there were some recurrent themes  among them  be yourself  be accountable  try to help others and society </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a couple of deans advised graduates to think about how they want others to remember them   i d suggest that you think about the stories other people will tell about you   hbs dean nitin nohria offered   are you acting entitled  are you using power in a way that benefits those who have less of it  or  rather  are you conducting yourself with the kind of grace that will leave the people you encounter so impressed that they will continue to tell wonderful stories about you years after an encounter   nick barniville  mba program director at esmt  gave similar advice   think of how you would like to be remembered and work backwards   he said   try to create something of lasting value  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>still other deans stuck to more purely practical advice  sleep is overrated  james g  ellis  dean of the marshall school of business at usc  told graduates   always say yes when invited to join friends acquaintances for dinner  say yes   he encouraged   you never know who you will meet  and you will build your own network  you can sleep when you die  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>esmt s barniville added   don t talk with chewing gum in your mouth  and try not to use words your mum wouldn t understand  don t be a bore  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and philippe oster  mba admissions director at hec paris  spoke specifically to the hazards and opportunities presented by social media   use social media with social grace   he recommended   such online platforms are likely to play an ever greater role in your professional life  but remember to go beyond the formulaic and standardized messages that linkedin and others have written for you   he said   after all  would you approach somebody at a dinner party or a conference and say by way of introduction  i would like to add you to my professional network   </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school s admission director provides guidance on new post interview exercise</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  s plan to pose a follow up question to its interviewees has created a flurry of its own questions from prospective applicants  questions hbs admissions director dee leopold sought to answer in a recent post to her director s blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to leopold  all interviewees will be asked the following question   you ve just had your hbs interview  tell us about it  how well did we get to know you   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs has not set a word limit on applicants  replies to this question  and leopold stressed that the exercise is not another essay   we want your response to be much more like an email   she writes  the hope behind this new element of the hbs application process is to give applicants an opportunity to interact with the hbs admissions staff in more of a real world scenario than traditional application elements have offered </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in the real world  it is unlikely that you will be given months and months to craft essays of any sort  it just doesn t happen   writes leopold   in the real world  it is almost a sure thing that you will be asked to write emails summarizing meetings and giving your opinion in a short time frame   she continues  noting that hbs tries to be as  close to practice  as possible  leopold calls this shift from essays to more real time writing appropriate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold s blog post comes in response to multiple inquiries from prospective applicants seemingly distraught over the    hour deadline on the new interview reflection email   i know this is hard to hear but this should not be a cause for anxiety   leopold stresses  hbs is simply looking for applicants  genuine reaction to the interview experience  in fact  leopold says  her team will even be much more generous in its reaction to typos and grammatical errors in this element of the application than in others </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that said  her team will not be pleased if an applicant s email seems like it was produced before the interview or was the result of significant coaching  editing or polishing   we do not expect you to solicit or receive any outside assistance with this exercise   she writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so there you have it </paragraph>

  <title>tuck alumnus endows new energy professorship  initiative</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a tuck school of business alumnus and energy industry executive has endowed a new professorship and energy initiative devoted to helping tuck students explore the business of finding  delivering and selling energy  the school announced this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>daniel revers  co founder of energy investment firm arclight capital partners  has worked in the energy industry since graduating from tuck in       he began on the industry side  working for wheelabrator technologies  and then moved to john hancock to work on the investment side  in       he founded arclight in boston with robb e  turner  and since then they have opened offices in new york  barcelona and luxembourg and grown to manage more than     billion in five funds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>his gift to tuck will endow the revers professorship of business administration and the revers energy initiative fund  tuck senior associate dean robert hansen has begun the search for a faculty member to fill the professorship position and envisions an energy economist who will teach an overview course and a specialized elective and create student focused activities such as workshops  conferences and networking opportunities  tuck expects the search for a professor to take at least a year  but the energy initiative will get underway in the meantime  offering programming starting this fall </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there is really nothing out there like this   says revers   and if there s any place that can take on something like this and produce something of value  it s tuck  the scale of the school is right to create customized programs and build the effort incrementally  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>revers  who has also served as a tuck overseer and funded the revers board fellows program and a faculty fellow  was motivated by two main factors in making this most recent gift to tuck  the first was the collaborative spirit of tuck s new master of health care delivery science program   the mhcds program is proof that the deans are willing to push the envelope to keep tuck on top today and to make sure tuck is on top five to    years down the road as well   he said   i think it s also a good example of how the different schools at the college can work together   he added  noting that similar collaboration between tuck and thayer and the dartmouth energy collaborative would make an energy initiative even better </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the surprising lack of mba talent in the energy industry was a second motivating factor for revers   the big companies in energy do not have the talent to assess and take advantage of this new market paradigm   revers said  referring to de regulation of the industry that has led to more complex  global  sophisticated markets   mbas with a general management education can apply their skills to unlocking the value in today s volatile energy market   he said </paragraph>

  <title>uva s darden school dean joins call for reinstatement of university president</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>darden school dean bob bruner joined the deans of several other schools at the university of virginia  uva  in issuing a statement yesterday to the board of visitors  bov  of the university and the media calling for the reinstatement of university president teresa sullivan  the bov unexpectedly announced on june   th that sullivan would step down after just two years in her post as president  inciting an immediate and passionate response from the university community representing strong opinions on all sides </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wall street journal incorrectly reported that bruner was the only dean of uva s    schools not to sign the statement  leading bruner to post the following to his dean s blog on friday   yesterday afternoon  the deans of the various divisions of uva issued the following statement to the board of visitors of the university of virginia and to the media  the statement itself identified none of the co authors  i participated in preparing this statement and lend my support to it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>together  the deans of the schools are calling for the reinstatement of sullivan and her team so that they can address  rapidly  thoughtfully  and in a collegial but urgent fashion  the fiscal challenges that face the public institution in the midst of reduced alumni giving and a near    percent reduction in state aid  the bov asked sullivan to step down for not instituting quickly enough sweeping changes to how the university is run  sullivan has said that she sought to take a more  incrementalist  approach  and protesters against her ouster have reacted to the bov s mandate as corporate style  top down management that violates the goals of a public institution  which should be based on open discourse and a sense of joint ownership and responsibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the bov is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow to reconsider sullivan s dismissal  sullivan has said that she will return on the condition that the board instead fires board chairperson helen dragas </paragraph>

  <title>four trends to watch in business school education</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an article this week in mashable  a leading source for news on digital innovation  highlighted four key trends to watch in graduate management education  the rise of entrepreneurship  a focus on collaborative management  required ethics and sustainability training and continued emphasis on increasing diversity among business school classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of entrepreneurship  the mashable article notes that mbas increasingly are forgoing more traditional careers in finance and banking to instead begin their own companies   the u s  is in a really exciting time because of this entrepreneurship bug that is spreading like the new version of the industrial revolution   brain meece  co founder of crowdfunding website rockethub  told mashable </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as a result  silicon valley is proving more of a draw than wall street  with a recent report showing that financial institutions are hiring even fewer people than they did during the first three quarters of       schools like spain s esade are also seeing recruiters look for greater entrepreneurial skills in prospective hires  mashable reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a shift toward teaching more collaborative models of management  too  is underway at schools like the stanford graduate school of business and france s hec  mashable reports  stanford  for its part  has taken steps to make collaboration a key part of its teaching and culture  hec  meanwhile  announced in february that it is launching a formal teaching partnership with google and will bring in digital entrepreneurs and google employees for a series of educational events </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the third trend  toward emphasis on ethics and sustainability as part of a business school education  has been widely observed in response to the      financial crisis and scandals like enron  mashable notes  a      survey by the aspen institute found that    percent of schools require a course in ethics or a related topic  up from only    percent in       student demand  in part  has driven this shift  according to stephanie ta  community manager for topmbaconnect com  a community website of prospective mba students   green mbas and social good are trends among the population of young professionals i serve   she told mashable   much of this is thanks to social media which has changed our behavior and what we expect from companies  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the fourth and final trend cited in the mashable piece is a move toward greater diversity among incoming business school classes  today  business schools are not only attempting to attract more women  minority and international students  but they are also launching cross disciplinary mbas and narrowly focused recruiting initiatives to help draw individuals who may not fit the traditional business school mold </paragraph>

    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>the anderson school of management at the university of california at los angeles  ucla  moved one step closer to converting its mba program from state supported to self supported  the school announced last week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on june  th  the legislative assembly of the ucla academic senate approved a proposal to forgo state funding by a vote of    to     the proposal now goes to the academic senate for the entire university of california and to uc president mark yudof  who has the final say </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if the proposal wins final approval  the anderson school will become the first mainstream uc program to rely solely on tuition and donations  it would join other business schools at top public institutions  such the university of virginia s darden school of business and university of michigan s ross school of business  which have also state cut funding ties in recent years </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our proposal is a response to the urgent need to find solutions to campus wide financial challenges   judy olian  dean of ucla anderson  said in a statement  anderson faces dramatic cuts in state funding  and the new self supporting funding model would give the school the authority to control tuition increases  have greater say in faculty hiring and make enhancements to its mba program </paragraph>

    <paragraph>under the anderson proposal  state support that otherwise would flow to ucla anderson would instead be available to the ucla campus for other programs that have also been hit by tough state budget cuts  campus budget officials estimate that the net financial gain to the campus would be      million annually </paragraph>

  <title>gmac launches new gmat featuring integrated reasoning section</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning today  the graduate management admissions text  gmat  used as part of the admissions process for business school will feature a new integrated reasoning section in which test takers will be asked to demonstrate their ability to use integrated reasoning to evaluate information from various sources and formats such as graphs  charts  tables and spreadsheets </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the graduate management admissions council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmac  began development of the new section two years ago in response to feedback from business school faculty from around the world about what emerging skill sets are increasingly critical to success in business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the strength of the new integrated reasoning section and the gmat exam as a whole lies in our unique position to respond to the specific needs of business schools and employers   dave wilson  president and ceo of gmac  said in a statement   the information age is demanding a new set of skills that require the integration of verbal and quantitative abilities to analyze different types of data from various sources  the new section on the gmat measures these skills  which have become essential for success in the classroom and in the business world   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new integrated reasoning section introduces innovative question types designed to measure test takers  data analysis skills as they evaluate information from a range of sources  rich lyons  dean of the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley  hopes the new section will make it easier to spot leadership potential   the integrated reasoning section will make us better at identifying it   he said in a statement   this type of reasoning is an important input to innovative leadership  which our businesses and societies need more than ever  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to gmac s      corporate recruiters survey  corporate recruiters are looking for the same skills  of       corporate recruiters representing more than     companies in    countries worldwide  more than    percent of respondents said that integrated reasoning skills were important in new hires  gmac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new    minute integrated reasoning section will not change the length of the gmat exam  instead  it will replace one of two    minute analytical writing essay questions on the previous version of the test  leaving the test at its current length of     hours  a test taker s total gmat score is still based on performance on the verbal and quantitative sections  on a         scale   and the integrated reasoning section  like the analytical writing assessment  is scored separately  gmac reports </paragraph>

  <title>surge of small firms recruit mbas  wall street journal reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the economic crisis of four years ago has had an unexpected if delayed positive impact on recruiting at several top business schools  according to a report this week in the wall street journal  wsj   in a bid to secure jobs for their graduates when large corporations halted recruiting  career services at top schools began reaching out to small firms for the first time  now  even as larger firms return to former recruiting levels  lots of smaller companies are on campuses to stay as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the downturn really forced the field of  business school recruiters  to diversify   nicole hall  president of the mba career services council  an association of business school career offices  told the wsj </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to a      survey by the career services council     percent of schools said they saw an increase in recruiting from small firms of     people or fewer  mit s sloan school of management invited small businesses to participate in a career fair during the last semester of the mba program  after traditional fall recruiting  sue kline  sloan s director of career development  told the wsj </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  the career center has started developing relationships with companies of     employees or fewer with a particular focus on start ups  this according to maria halpern  a senior associate director in mba career management at the philadelphia school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it means more prospects for mba students   especially as larger firms return to recruiting levels of the past  and for small companies it means the opportunity to land hires with strong skills gained at top schools who they wouldn t otherwise be able to lure </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but even with a struggling economy and a tight job market  lots of mbas are still reluctant to work for smaller  lesser known firms with smaller salaries and fewer perks </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the environment is proving to be a little scary for kids to come in and not have a big  fat paycheck   christine ingraham  owner of box kitchen  a guilford  conn   maker of modular kitchen cabinets  told the wsj  she recruited at sloan last spring but after interviewing a handful of candidates the one offer she made was declined  nonetheless  she plans to return to sloan to recruit as business expands  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to draw top candidates who might otherwise try to hold out for larger paychecks at large firms  smaller companies are stressing their flexible roles and relaxed atmospheres  an approach that is working for some  according to the wsj </paragraph>

  <title>stanford gsb dean discusses teaching innovation  creativity</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a recent interview with the wall street journal  stanford graduate school of business  gsb  dean garth saloner explains how he thinks innovation is a skill that can be taught  his thinking is informed by several years he took off from teaching at stanford to serve as an advisor to silicon valley startups  it s a belief he feels fervently enough to have overhauled the school s curriculum to include more teaching of innovation in core classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to saloner  who took over as stanford gsb dean in       innovation requires people to be  change agents  who use a mix of leadership  analytical and management skills   all of which he believes can be taught </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we think we re providing students with the ability to tackle the big problems   he told the wsj  as the wsj article points out  many prospective students are clamoring to take part in the revamped curriculum focused on teaching innovation  last year        applicants applied for a class that wound up including just     students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the wsj interview published this week  south africa native saloner answered questions ranging from whether things like innovation and creativity can really be taught to how stanford gsb in particular sets out to teach personal leadership skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some key excerpts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>saloner on how to teach creativity   here we draw heavily from design elements from our design school   he told the wsj    being creative  starts with customer empathy and talking to them and understanding their perspective  get out of the analytical armchair and go and talk to the person whose situation you re trying to address  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>saloner on proof that teaching innovation is working   one example is the story of embrace  it was a multidisciplinary team  of students  from the business school  medical school and engineering school  they went to a rural village in nepal and found out that    million low birth weight babies are born a year  world wide  and that four million die a year and that s essentially because they don t have baby incubators  that s a real problem  so you come back here and ask what do we do about it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>long story short  they invented a baby sleeping bag that in the back has this material  that can be warmed up   parents can throw it into boiling water and bring it up to a desired temperature and slip it back into the bag and it is a fully functional baby warmer  and they ve gone out as a company  </paragraph>

  <title>new generation gmat debuts soon  driven in part by rising numbers of chinese  indian test takers</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the new york times  nyt  this week discussed the new graduate management admissions test  gmat   how it differs from the previous test  what motivated some of the changes  how it compares to the graduate record examination  gre   and what steps test administrators are taking to prevent cheating and fraud </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beginning in june  the gmat will feature four parts instead of the traditional three  in addition to sections testing verbal skills  math skills and analytic writing ability  the next generation exam will also feature a section devoted to testing integrated reasoning  this new section  which will challenge test takers to understand and synthesize data from multiple sources as means of predicting probable outcomes  was added in part to help safeguard against cheating  according to the nyt article  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the nyt article acknowledged that the newly designed gmat comes as the proportion of test takers from mainland china is experiencing rapid growth  part of a trend dating back about five years  in       just over       chinese citizens or residents  or roughly   percent of the total  took the exam  compared to        in       the nyt reports  figures could reach        next year  representing    percent of overall test takers   these figures do not take into account thousands of test takers from hong kong and taiwan  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>india  too  is seeing a rapid number of new applicants  in      there were        applications  according to nyt article   schools around the world are seeing this coming into their pipelines   alex chisholm  of the graduate management admission council  gmac   which develops and administers the gmat  said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ashok sarathy  gmac s vice president in charge of the testing program  noted that the gmat exam has in fact been in  continuous evolution  since its february      introduction by nine business schools  including harvard business school  columbia business school  the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania and northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>changes have included the addition of a section on data sufficiency in the early     s and the swap out of a section on antonyms and analogies in place of an added section on reading comprehension in the     s  and in       they added an analytical writing ability component  sarathy continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sarathy went on to add that this newest section on integrated reasoning comes in to respond from business schools  asking for a way to evaluate a new set of skills  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we did a survey of more than     faculty from schools all over the world   he told the nyt   as a result  we developed a set of questions aimed at testing the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources in order to solve complex problems  they also wanted candidates to be able to indicate what information was relevant  and not relevant  and to be able to evaluate which among a set of possible outcomes were the most likely  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in a globally competitive world  the ability to analyze data presented in different formats   for example  in tabular or graphical form  or in written summary   and to then identify where you might find a competitive advantage becomes increasingly important    sarathy added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new section will take    minutes to complete and replaces the essay writing component of the analytical writing portion  leaving the total test time unchanged at three and a half hours  or four hours including breaks </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley s haas school to launch new digital courses</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley this summer plans to leap online with the introduction of three pilot digital courses that will make use of cutting edge technology to teach students outside of the traditional classroom  one class is a prerequisite for the school s evening   weekend mba program  another is a popular mba elective for both fulltime and evening and weekend students and the third is an undergraduate course </paragraph>
    <paragraph> digital education is revolutionizing how we teach  including our traditional courses  it already affords us new and deeper ways to customize how students absorb material and how they link it to their own interests   haas dean rich lyons said in an article on the haas website about the new courses   this is the future  we need  to  shape it and be a leader   he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first online course   data and decisions   will be rolled out in june for evening   weekend mba students   professional judgment in accounting   an undergraduate course  will begin online in july  and  power and politics   a popular mba elective  will be offered online to fulltime and evening and weekend students in the fall b semester </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas specifically chose both quantitative and qualitative courses as well as faculty with different teaching styles for the pilot courses  according to jay stowsky  haas senior assistant dean for instruction  different vendors will implement each of the three courses to give haas the opportunity to compare effectiveness of different approaches to online education development  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>faculty and administrators hope the online courses will provide some advantages over traditional classroom courses  such as the ability to tailor material to individual students  needs and interests and the opportunity to encourage participation by students who might not be as likely to speak up in class </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is a much safer environment that pushes them to contribute a lot more   says associate professor cameron anderson  who teaches the  power and politics  class   i think there is going to be a ton more participation   he also hopes students may actually learn more from one another than in the in class version of the course because they will be required to have more group discussions on their own </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  anderson hopes the digital courses will give students the important advantage of being able to go at their own pace   i ve heard from my students that my class is like drinking from a fire hose   he says   this online approach allows for self paced learning that i think will benefit students in their busy  time constrained lives  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>funding for the pilot digital courses comes from a    million matching gift from steve and susan chamberlin  mba     former members of the haas faculty </paragraph>

  <title>prospective mba applicants still overwhelmingly choose gmat over gre  kaplan survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the makers of the graduate record examination  gre  have revised their test and made a strong push to market it as an admissions alternative to the graduate management admissions test  gmat   but prospective mba applicants still overwhelmingly opt to take the gmat  a recent kaplan test prep survey finds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a survey of     kaplan gmat students between november      and april       kaplan found that only    percent said they considered taking the gre instead of the gmat  of the    percent who said they never considered taking the gre  the majority     percent  said the main reason was because they thought some or all of their target schools only accept the gmat  nineteen percent  meanwhile  said they felt applicants who submit a gmat score have an admissions advantage over those who submit a gre score  and   percent said it was because they thought they would do better on the gmat than on the gre </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  prospective applicants who opted for the gmat over the gre because they thought their target schools don t accept the latter may have been misinformed  according to kaplan test prep director of graduate programs lee weiss   we believe that number may be inflated because of a lack of information   weiss said in a statement   many of them would be surprised to know that most  if not all of the business schools they plan on applying to accept the gre  in addition to the gmat   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite growing acceptance of the gre as an alternative to the gmat by top mba programs  kaplan test prep still advises prospective applicants to choose the more traditionally accepted gmat exam if they are applying only to business school and not to other graduate programs as well   according to a separate kaplan survey of business school admissions officers  applicants who submit a gmat score have a slight admissions advantage over applicants who submit a gre score   weiss said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the makers of the gmat aren t sitting by idle as the gre test makers try to gain more of the mba market  mind you  the gmat will feature an added integrated reasoning section beginning this june as part of an effort to solidify its status as the best predictor of student success in business school </paragraph>

  <title>fuqua school of business s loan assistance program helps graduates give back</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the loan assistance program  lap  at duke university s fuqua school of business  now in its   th year  has awarded almost    million to    fuqua alumni who participated in social impact activities as students and pursued work with nonprofit and government organizations upon graduation  thanks to lap  students like chad sclove  mba     have been able to apply the business skills they learn at fuqua to small organizations working hard to make a big difference </paragraph>
    <paragraph> without the loan assistance program  i wouldn t be in my current line of work   sclove says  participants in lap  which is managed by fuqua s center for the advancement of social enterprise  case  and its financial aid office  receive loan assistance disbursements twice a year  these awards  of up to          make it possible for students like sclove to meet their loan repayment responsibilities while taking work in fields with more modest pay  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sclove  who is now the managing director of common goods  a nonprofit consultancy that provides services to children with disabilities  hadn t even thought about working in the nonprofit world before coming to fuqua   the combination of fuqua s social enterprise curriculum  the activities of case  career counseling and the loan assistance program opened up new doors for me   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to ensure the sustainability of lap into the future amid growing demand for its services  a team of fuqua officials recently reviewed the program  they will implement some changes going forward in an effort to assure that available funds go to those who need them most </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beginning with the november      deadline  lap will handle applications and disbursements annually rather than twice a year and will start including spousal income and graduate school debt in their financial evaluation for each applicant  lap s administrators are also modifying the formula they use to determine what percentage of a student s household income is eligible for coverage through the program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>under the revised guidelines  new participants must opt in and apply for lap within three years of graduation to be eligible for the assistance available to their graduating class  and they must also describe their interest and participation in social impact activities at fuqua as part of the application  in an effort to expand the reach of the program  future classes will be eligible for awards of up to        per year for up to eight years after graduation  down from         per year for up to ten years </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we recognized the importance of improving the sustainability of the loan assistance program in order to bring it in line with our core belief that those with the greatest need should be eligible for the greatest awards   said matthew t a  nash  case s executive director   these modifications will enable fuqua to continue supporting leaders of consequence in the social sector  </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan researchers use neuroscience to understand consumer spending</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>what influences people s decisions to spend money  researchers at mit sloan s neuroeconomics laboratory are taking a closer look at brain activity to help uncover the answers  the school reported this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>using an expensive technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri   scientists at the athinoula a  martinos imaging center are scanning people s brains as they make real decisions involving money  hoping to test traditional assumptions about consumer spending  drazen prelec  a professor of management at mit sloan and in the mit economics and brain and cognitive sciences departments  is leading the research </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this could fulfill an ancient dream of revealing what is happening inside the head as we make decisions   prelec said as part of an article on the mit sloan website  glimpsing actual brain activity   especially with regard to trust or brand loyalty   could provide valuable new insight into decisions people make that defy conscious explanations   people may believe that they drink coke for the taste  but in reality they may be responding mainly to the brand image   prelec said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>recent research using brain scanning found that when making personal financial decisions online  subjects were more likely to trust bank representatives whose faces resembled their own   we suspect this is unconscious   prelec said   there may be deep evolutionary reasons for trusting someone who resembles you   he continued  adding that brain scans suggested that the mistrust of a stranger s face was mediated by a brain structure called the amygdala  responsible for rapid  unconscious judgments of fear and mistrust </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prelec and colleagues also have used brain scanning to understand how people feel about payment and personal finances  revealing that brain structures associated with pain were activated when subjects saw a high price appear next to a product they were considering purchasing  this could help explain why consumers favor purchasing arrangements that disguise the payment transactions  such as subscriptions  or why people seem more willing to pay a higher price when paying with credit rather than with cash  it may literally feel less painful </paragraph>

  <title>startup by harvard mbas to sell access to admitted students  application essay sets</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a startup business venture by six harvard business school  hbs  mbas will give prospective applicants access  for a fee  to actual sets of application essays written by candidates recently admitted to the school  according to a recent article in poets quants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>called mba bee to convey the idea of  spreading the pollen of knowledge   the main purpose of the new venture is to give applicants from international  military or other nontraditional backgrounds the same kind of access to information that counterparts from more traditional backgrounds like finance and consulting more typically have  say its founders   we want to lower the barrier between the people who have the knowledge and the people who desire it   may lam  one of the startup s co founders  told p q   for them  it s a lot more like shooting in the dark  once you see a couple of essay sets you will see some underlying themes that will help you present your best candidacy  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the goal of mba bee will be to build a database of successful essay sets which potential applicants can then buy according to key criteria that matches their own  such as career experience  age  and whether they are an international or domestic applicant  p q reports  and at least to start  the company s founders have convinced fellow classmates to surrender their own actual application s essays for free  though they would consider a revenue share agreement if it allowed them to build out the business and expand to other top schools  they told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba bee is not the first to seek to sell access to successful hbs application essays   editors of hbs s the harbus student newspaper have put out two editions of     successful harvard business school application essays  since       but the startup s founders think that providing essay answers from the same applicant to each of hbs s four application questions sets their offering apart   we felt there is a big need in the market for essay sets so applicants can see how successful applicants told their stories from start to finish   lam told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba bee last month launched its first website  armedforcesmba com  where it will target military applicants  selling separate sets of essays from successful hbs applicants from each the army  air force  coast guard  marines corps and navy  the selling price will be      per set  though they are available now for a special introductory offer of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though not officially endorsed by the school  the new essay selling startup is an outgrowth of hbs s recently revised mba curriculum  in which student teams receive seed money from the school to create and launch a new product or service development project  p q reports </paragraph>

  <title>mba admissions staff monitor for plagiarism in application essays</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>following the disclosure earlier this year by ucla anderson school of management that it rejected    applicants to its mba program under suspicion of plagiarism  more business schools are turning to paid services that can detect when prospective applicants try to pass off pre canned work as part of their own application essays  a financial times article reports this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at ucla anderson  detecting plagiarism among applicants was an unanticipated result of going digital with its application process  anderson s admissions staff this year began reviewing all applications using ipads   once we went digital  all kinds of possibilities opened up  including the option to run admissions essays through turnitin   andrew ainslie  anderson s senior associate dean  told the ft  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>turnitin  one of several detection software programs available to higher education institutions  has the largest english language database with    billion web pages      million  scholarly items  secured through partnerships with publishers and     million papers submitted to the service  the ft reports  according to iparadigms  which markets turnitin  more than    percent of higher education institutions in north america and almost    per cent in the united kingdom have a turnitin license </paragraph>

    <paragraph>leopold shared that her team will send emails out at noon tomorrow  march   th  conveying round   admissions decisions   congratulatory calls will follow  but we don t do admissions notification via phone   she wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tomorrow s admissions decisions will include waitlist invitations  leopold continued   i know for sure we are going to use the waitlist   probably beginning in early may and trying to wrap it up by early june   she wrote  adding that she anticipates that her office will be able to make offers to between    and    candidates on the waitlist  some from each rounds   and   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also reminded candidates that hbs doesn t make financial aid awards at the time of admission  the school provides generous financial aid to both u s  and international students based on demonstrated financial need regardless of the round in which candidates are admitted   it s not a  rolling  process   as in  we don t run out of need based money  round   admits have access to exactly the same resources as round     she wrote </paragraph>

  <title>alumni based lending program for mba students to head to the united states</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>prodigy finance  a london based company started in      by insead alumni  expects to enter the u s  business school market later this year with new options for international students who need loans to fund their education  according to a report this week in bloomberg businessweek  last week  the united kingdom s cranfield school of management signed on to prodigy s online community based loan program  becoming the second in that country and the sixth in europe to adopt it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>created by three insead alumni who themselves had trouble securing funding when they were international mbas  the prodigy program allows alumni of a particular school to place money in community education bonds that provide loans for students who follow behind them at that school  the loans  which carry an average     percent interest rate  are competitive with other loan providers in the u s  and europe  and students are required to repay them within seven years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy s model uses a  predictive scorecard  to assess a student s future earning potential  rather than previous income and work history  which traditional banks use  investors can expect a six percent return on their investment and receive the names and bios of the students they invest in  cameron stevens  prodigy s chief executive officer and a co founder of the company  told bloomberg bw   it s a very transparent investment and that concept really resonates with alumni   stevens said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy s platform comes at a time when many business schools are in need of just such a solution  the bloomberg bw article notes  several prominent loan programs that helped international students finance study at european business schools have dried up  and many business schools in the united states have had a hard time finding options for their international students that don t require a u s  co signer since the end of the citiassist loan program in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there definitely is a gap out there and the market has not come back   kevin moehn of moehn management  a company that works with banks to facilitate student loans  told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy  which has raised about     million in funding for students attending european business schools and hopes to raise      million by the end of the year  expects to sign additional european schools in the next few months and enter the u s  market this june  stevens told bloomberg bw  insead  the university of oxford s said business school and russia s skolkovo school of management are among the schools that have already signed on with prodigy </paragraph>

  <title>video outlines upcoming curriculum changes at cmu s tepper school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>late last year  the tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university announced that it will roll out a new curriculum next fall incorporating more training in leadership and writing  these represent important shifts for a school best known for its heavy focus on teaching quantitative skills  as part of the new curriculum  tepper first year students also will have more training in core subject areas before recruiters arrive on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a new video posted to the tepper website this week  mike trick  senior associate dean of education  talks about the new mba curriculum and how it builds on tepper s deep allegiance to business fundamentals and data analysis while helping better prepare first year students for interviews with recruiters   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> businesses want interns to be useful right away and therefore our curriculum has to provide useful people right from the get go   trick says  noting that recruiters have begun coming to campus earlier and earlier   the problem for us was that when people were coming in  to interview  for internships  they  students  knew the fundamentals but they didn t know the specifics of marketing or finance   he continued  in response  tepper has tried to move a few core courses up earlier and has introduced a new intensive pre program called basecamp providing an integrated overview of business and how the core disciplines and business functions work together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>robert dammon  who became dean last may after serving for    years as a professor of financial economics at the school  is spearheading the changes to tepper s curriculum as well as embarking upon an ambitious fundraising effort to build a bigger building to accommodate tepper s growing class  he told the wall street journal  wsj  in a recent interview that he hopes to expand the mba program by as much as    percent  to     students  in order to take advantage of economies of scale </paragraph>

    <paragraph>in an effort to help prospective mba students finance their programs as traditional bank sources for loans have dried up  business schools in the united kingdom are turning to a model developed by insead alumni in which alumni of a business school invest in those who will follow after them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the company  london based prodigy finance  was set up by three insead alumni  graduates of the school invest in the future careers of classmates who follow behind with the expectation that they will receive a good rate of return on their investment  the university of oxford s said business school announced last december that it has created a program with prodigy  and the financial times reported this week that the cranfield school of management has followed suit   several other top u k  business schools are expected to launch similar arrangements before the next mba enrollment in september  the ft added </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we deliberately only partner with world class business schools like cranfield that offer leading mba programs that consistently perform well in the major mba rankings   ryan steele  chief operating officer at prodigy finance  told the ft   the program provides alumni and other investors the opportunity to earn a competitive return on their investment while helping to fund future business leaders  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in contrast to traditional bank loans  prodigy assesses a student s future potential earnings   and by extension his or her ability to repay the loans   using a predictive scorecard rather than historic salary data  cranfield mbas from more than     countries will be eligible to apply online for the loan once the new program is fully in place </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley s haas school of business to expand campus  perhaps increase mba class size</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley is planning a multi million dollar campus expansion  including the construction of a new building  which could provide for an increase in the size of the school s full time mba class  according to a report last week in the daily californian </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new building  which is expected to cost     million to construct  would provide for new classrooms and learning spaces  michelle mcclellan  assistant dean of development and alumni relations for the business school and the top fundraiser for the project  told the daily californian  an additional     million could go to proposed renovations and enhancement of the school s library and courtyard  she added  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> haas had undertaken a master space planning project several years back  and this was eventually the outburst of that   mcclellan said   it s been a process that has evolved over time  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcclellan did not provide a timeline for the project s completion  stating that fundraising began in january      and that     million has thus far been pledged  mcclellan acknowledged that expansion of the full time mba program is one possibility that is being considered quite seriously as part of the overall expansion project although several other options are also being looked at and no official decisions have been made yet </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think it would be great if we expanded our mba program  it s very small relative to other mba programs in the u s    one of the smallest in the country   nancy wallace  haas professor of real estate  told the daily californian  haas  full time mba program enrolls approximately     students per year  compared to about     at stanford graduate school of business and closer to     at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and harvard business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an interview with poets quants  haas dean richard lyons said that the new building would allow the school to increase the size of its full time program to     once completed  he also allowed that the new space could enable haas to launch a second executive mba program in addition to its current joint partnership emba with columbia university in new york   this new building will give us some real options   he told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nonetheless  significant fundraising remains before the project can get underway   we cannot break ground until we have all commitments   mcclellan told the daily californian </paragraph>

  <title>u s  schools increase one year mba programs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as applications to two year  full time mba programs declined for a third consecutive year  more u s  schools are beginning to offer one year programs to attract a different type of student  the financial times reports  though one year programs have been standard at most european business schools for some time  some industry experts worry about their limitations in the united states  the ft continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph> european programs for the most part require significant pre enrolment work experience   john fernandes  president and chief executive of the association to advance collegiate schools of business aacsb   told the ft   with this  a one year program may be fine for some students who are mostly interested in returning to and advancing within their current company  for students with little or no professional experience  it is a stretch to get all they need in one year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools point out that one year programs have a particular appeal in lean economic years since they are both less expensive and represent a lesser opportunity cost since students leave the workforce for a shorter period of time to complete them  that said  accelerated courses usually appeal to a different target student   one that is older and more seasoned  but not as experienced as those who look toward executive mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s a certain type of student that s drawn to the one year program   katie lloyd  an admissions officer at emory s goizueta business school  told the ft   they re more focused   she said  adding that a lot of self selection goes on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft article noted that goizueta is one of a handful of top tier programs that have for some time offered an accelerated one year  full time option  others include cornell s johnson school of business and northwestern s kellogg school of management  but students who elect a one year program must keep in mind the ways in which it differs from the more traditional two year programs  school administrators caution </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  graduates of one year programs face greater recruiting challenges  since they will graduate at the same time as students in two year programs but will not have gone through an interview cycle or completed a summer internship  the ft article notes   they have to work a bit harder to find jobs   randy allen  associate dean for international and corporate relations at johnson  told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>school officials also concede that it can be hard to cover all the basics of an mba and still provide time for electives such as entrepreneurship or ethics   the experience is different   allen told the ft   the core is done in a condensed time frame  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the aacbs s fernandez worries that even with requirements that applicants to one year programs have a strong financial background  the compressed offerings still may not adequately prepare students for the job search   i don t think they re a good idea in terms of what the employment market wants out of business graduates   fernandes told the ft   a lot of the traditional schools are shaking their heads   but he understands the conditions that have led schools to expand their offerings   the economic realities are forcing schools to make do the best they can   he said </paragraph>

  <title>northwestern s kellogg school of management charts new course</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the kellogg school of management at northwestern university yesterday announced a new comprehensive strategy that includes shrinking its two year mba program  enlarging its one year mba program  expanding its global footprint and sharpening its brand  the plan  coined envision kellogg  follows from an in depth strategic review led by dean sally blount  who assumed leadership of kellogg in july      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there are times in history when transformational change becomes imperative for an organization   because the world in which that organization has thrived fundamentally changes   blount said on a website launched yesterday to communicate the new strategy   now is one of those times for kellogg  the nature of business and how it operates in the   st century requires that we rethink who we are and how we do what we do   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through envision kellogg  the school hopes to  shape business education and thought leadership for the   st century   the website proclaims  the    month      degree assessment that informed the new strategy involved more than       alumni  faculty  administrators  students  corporate partners and others and was completed with the assistance of consulting firms booz   co   boston consulting group and deloitte </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among other things  this comprehensive review revealed increasing demand for the school s    month mba program for students who already have an undergraduate degree  application volume and class size for this program have both been on the rise since       while applications to kellogg s full time two year mba program have fallen in the last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s very clear that growth in demand for the two year mba is going to be slowing and that growth for one year programs will be growing   blount said in an interview with poetsandquants   we have to be realistic about the market in which we find ourselves  we think the market for two year mbas is going to get very elite  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for this reason  kellogg plans to market its one year program more aggressively  blount told poetsandquants that she thinks enrollment in kellogg s one year mba program could grow from its current    students to perhaps     over the next five years  while enrollment in the school s two year program could fall to about     students from       </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the two year mba is a stunning product that we are very proud of   blount told poetsandquants   we are definitely staying in that market  but we are preparing for a world where the best students may not want that and they have options  we don t think    something people from china are going to come to the u s  for a two year degree  the opportunity cost is just perceived to be too high  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the strategic plan also calls for the creation of four  impact areas  that will reorganize how the school conducts research and what makes up its curriculum  these four areas   coined  markets  customers and growth    innovation and entrepreneurship    architectures of collaboration   and  private enterprise and public policy    are intended to provide a framework for study within kellogg s traditional core academic areas of finance  accounting  marketing  strategy  organizational behavior  and managerial economics and decision sciences </paragraph>

  <title>european business schools see application volume drop</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>two thirds of european business schools saw application volume drop last year after rising steadily for years  according to the graduate management admissions council  gmac   which administers the gmat entrance exam used by most schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an article yesterday in the wall street journal highlighted gmac application trend data  noting that some european schools saw the number of applicants fall by more than    percent even before the latest round of economic challenges hit the region  even schools in more economically stable countries like switzerland and the united kingdom have been affected  in part because their tuitions have been rendered increasingly steep by falling currencies in neighboring countries  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the journal article  european students who can afford it have been looking to programs overseas   either at u s  schools or at the overseas campuses of european schools   as a means of setting themselves up for better post graduate employment options  spain s iese business school in barcelona saw its application volume drop   percent this year as locals  deterred by the country s      percent unemployment rate  have applied overseas instead  the journal reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  in switzerland  imd business school is having a harder time convincing european students that its program is worth the investment  especially as the euro s value has dropped against the swiss franc  applications from students from western europe  which account for    percent of the swiss school s class  dropped    percent  imd has increased financial aid by a third  delayed payment deadlines and encouraged students to apply for more loans in an effort to counteract the drop in applicants  the journal reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>likewise  italy s sda bocconi school of management is now extending merit based tuition waivers  one for    percent of tuition costs and another for    percent  to students from countries other than italy in western europe </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other european schools with campuses in different regions of the world have seen european students favor those locations instead  the journal article added  for example  the shanghai campus of france s grenoble graduate school of business has had an uptick in european students over the past two years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>telio gourdon  a master s student in international business at grenoble s singapore campus  says he was motivated to leave his native france by the prospect of greater international exposure and better post graduation employment options   singapore is a good place to be for a businessman   he told the journal </paragraph>

  <title>chicago booth admissions committee provides waitlist update</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a change to its waitlist process this year  the university of chicago booth school of business will feature a waitlist enrollment form allowing candidates to immediately opt in or out of the list and will permit waitlisted candidates to submit a    second video update regarding their candidacy  the admissions committee shared this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a post yesterday to the booth insider  the school s mba admissions blog  associate director of admissions carrie lydon shared these and other updates regarding the waitlist process  the applications of candidates who accept the offer to become part of the waitlist will be considered for admission again as part of round   and will receive an updated decision on march   st  the final decision date for the round   we will try to make a final decision by that point  but there is a possibility that you could remain on the waitlist through round     lydon wrote  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chicago booth has introduced the new waitlist enrollment form in an effort to give candidates the opportunity to decide what is best for them while helping the admissions committee better understand who is genuinely interested in remaining on the list  the form is in no way binding  though  and candidates who have indicated they wish to remain on the list can withdraw themselves at any point by emailing admissions chicagobooth edu </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  chicago booth s admissions committee invites waitlisted candidates to send relevant updates regarding their candidacy  to be added to their files for consideration as part of future rounds   the content and format of an update is entirely up to you  but ideally the materials you provide should add insight into your qualifications and strength of fit with chicago booth beyond what was presented in your original application   lydon wrote  updates can be submitted via the  upload materials  section of the applicant status page </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new this year  waitlisted candidates can also upload a    second video for the admissions committee   in the age of digital media  we recognize that video is a common tool of communication  and want to provide any interested candidate with the opportunity to use it   says lydon  here  too  the content is up to the candidate  videos can be uploaded via the  portfolio  section of applicant status page  all updates must be submitted no later than march  st </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in her post  lydon stressed that this year s round   was a very competitive one and that the admissions committee was simply unable to accept every qualified applicant   while it likely wasn t the news you were hoping to hear  if you received a waitlist notification  please know that the waitlist is a good place to be   she wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to those who do decide to accept a place on the chicago booth waitlist  best of luck from all of us here at clear admit  don t forget that you can share your experiences and learn from those of others on the clear admit wiki </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>in a recent post to her director s blog  harvard business school  hbs  dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold shared her team s plans to notify prospective candidates who submitted applications as part of hbs s round   this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> on monday  december   th   hopefully at noon boston time   all round   interviewees will receive an email saying their decision is available online   she wrote  she added that her team does not make any calls ahead of time   none  and that s a promise   she said   whatever the news is for you  we want to make sure you at least have control over the timing   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph> on december   th  candidates who have been admitted or denied a place in the next hbs class will learn their fate  in addition  leopold shared  her team will invite about     or so candidates to join the waitlist  those who are invited to join this list will receive additional information from dana scalisi  who manages this process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold will also have call in hours in january for candidates who are denied admissions after an interview   i wouldn t call these  feedback  calls since they aren t very detailed but sometimes it can be reassuring to hear that there were not specific weaknesses in an application  but rather just the reality of a highly selective process with the goal of maximizing the mix of voices and perspectives in the classroom   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck to all those who are waiting anxiously </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school incorporates new field method into curriculum</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph> if it works  the field method could become an equal partner to the case method   harvard business school  hbs  dean nitin nohria told the economist in a recent interview  the field method  field immersion experience for leadership development  is a new practical addition to hbs s curriculum  a radical departure from a course of study that until now has been based exclusively on discussing cases written by professors in classroom settings  according to the economist report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nohria arrived at hbs in july      determined to see that hbs students get more in the way of practical application of management skills than just what they gain from summer internships with prospective employers  as a result  this year s incoming class will serve as guinea pigs for the new field method  which will include three elements as part of the first year  the economist reports  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first  they will participate in a team building exercise in which students take turns leading a group project loosely based on ones used in the u s  army  second  students will travel to work for a week with one of more than     firms in    countries  finally  hbs first years wil be given eight weeks and        worth of seed money each to launch a small company  what will happen in the second year of the new field course remains to be determined </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some have expressed skepticism about elements of the new curriculum component   the literature suggests that an immersion experience needs to be at least     weeks and be backed up with time in the classroom   management guru pankaj ghemawat told the economist  raising questions about how effective a one week work assignment overseas will be  and the faculty vote in favor of trying the new field method was  as enthusiastic as you could get from a faculty   nohria told the economist  noting that it gave approval for a  delicate experiment for     years to see if we can move the needle   the case method  by comparison  took    years to develop </paragraph>
    <paragraph>notably  the new course adds    to    percent to the         hbs students currently pay per year of study  for the time being  hbs is bearing this additional cost as it figures out what works  the economist reports </paragraph>

  <title>hec paris tops financial times       european business school rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>hec paris maintained its number one position in the financial times  ranking of best european business schools this year  released this week  insead bumped london business school from number two to number three  and spain s iese business school and switzerland s imd came in at fourth and fifth respectively  overall  there were no dramatic changes in the line up of top european schools save the rapid ascent of italy s sda bocconi school of management  which tied for seventh this year as compared to its three year rank of   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a special report accompanying the rankings  the ft s della bradshaw pointed out that european schools  which until now attracted non european applicants with their diverse student bodies and globally focused curriculums  face several new threats that could undermine these advantages  chief among them are the continuing euro crisis and the reluctance of european governments to award post degree work visas to non europeans as well as the rapid rise of chinese and indian business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dipak jain  who took the helm as dean of insead this year after retiring as dean of northwestern  kellogg school of management  does not believe that european schools will feel an immediate impact from the rising number of quality asian schools    there is still a very large part of the asian world that wants a western program   he told the ft   that is not going to go away in the next    years or so  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to jain  the real problem european schools face is money  he points out that european schools lack the robust endowments that many u s  business schools boast  which limits the european institutions  ability to fund top level research   the question is  how do you create shock absorbers or cushions   he told the ft   in europe you can t rely on alumni giving  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but according to peter tufano  who like jain this year traded a u s  school for a european one  tufano left harvard business school to become dean of the said business school at oxford   there is no real difference between schools on either side of the atlantic   i see a lot more similarities than differences   tufano told the ft  noting that the issues being talked about in business and in business school are the same on both sides of the pond  views are even converging on issues like the supremacy of shareholder value  which used to divide the teaching between u s  and european schools   i think everyone has adopted a more nuanced view than when i did an mba   there are times i can close my eyes and i don t really feel i am in a different place   tufano said </paragraph>

  <title>indian school of business wins aacsb accreditation</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the association to advance collegiate schools of business  aacsb  last week accredited the indian school of business  isb   making the indian school the first in south asia to be recognized by the american based accrediting organization </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are delighted to have received the prestigious aacsb accreditation  which is regarded as the hallmark of excellence in business education   isb dean ajit rangnekar said in a statement   we are confident that this recognition will translate into increased interest by the international community comprising of faculty  students and recruiters  and help us chart asia s and india s growth as the global management education hub   added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>aacsb accreditation has been earned by less than five percent of the world s business schools  isb reports  of the     business schools currently accredited by the global organization  the vast majority are in the united states  to achieve aacsb accreditation  schools must undergo a process of rigorous internal review  evaluation and adjustment and meet a series of high standards  including demonstrating a high quality teaching environment  a commitment to continuous improvement and curricula responsive to the needs of businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the financial times  isb s accreditation could pave the way for increased competition between the two principle international accreditation bodies  aacsb from the united states and equis from europe  equis already accredits two indian business schools  the indian institutes of management in ahmedabad and bangalore  the ft anticipates that the two accrediting bodies are likely to see a surge in applications from other institutions  as indian business schools try to carve a role on the global stage </paragraph>

  <title>ucla anderson school of management dean examines business school landscape</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a recent article in bized magazine  ucla anderson school of management dean judy olian took a hard look at the global business school landscape  assessing the obstacles and triumphs of the past decade as well as the challenges that face its future  a decade out from chairing a task force that characterized management education as  at risk   olian says now that she sees reason for  tempered cheer  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ten years ago the concerns about the future of business schools were linked to a shortage of academically qualified faculty  a curriculum considered increasingly irrelevant and increased competition from non accredited institutions  writes olian  today  though not eradicated  several of these problems have been addressed to some degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though the number of u s  trained phds in business and management almost doubled between      and       an explosive growth in business schools globally has meant that the increase still hasn t been sufficient to keep pace with demand  resulting in fierce competition among schools for qualified faculty  but a shift toward attracting professionally  rather than academically  qualified teachers has helped alleviate faculty shortages  olian writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this trend toward embracing senior level business professionals to fill faculty roles has also helped address concerns regarding the relevancy of the business school curriculum   schools have not only hired more practitioners as faculty  but also introduced creative curricula and pedagogical innovations that are more market focused  career oriented  technologically supported  and globally immersive   she writes  still  schools need to break free from traditionally rigid faculty department structures to better align programs with the real business world  and management education leaders need to lend their voices and ideas to important societal issues such as education  poverty  healthcare and sustainability  olian stresses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fragmentation of the graduate management education landscape has only grown more pronounced over the past decade  olian writes  with more types of providers  more campuses  and more diversity of programs than ever before  meanwhile  the cost of business school has soared  rendering many schools inaccessible and unaffordable  the economic crisis has damaged job prospects for some graduates and critics of management education have grown more vocal  calling the virtuousness of business education into question </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if i were writing a report today on the future of business schools  i d title it  realizing the promise of business schools for the world  still much to accomplish    olian says </paragraph>

  <title>carnegie mellon s tepper school of business revamps curriculum</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university  a school known for its heavy focus on teaching quantitative skills  will roll out a new curriculum next fall incorporating more training in leadership and writing  the school also has moved to teaching core subject areas before recruiters arrive on campus in an effort to better prepare first years to secure summer internships in an increasingly competitive environment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>robert dammon  who became dean last may after serving for    years as a professor of financial economics at the school  is shepherding these changes as well as embarking upon an ambitious fundraising effort to build a bigger building to accommodate tepper s growing class  he told the wall street journal  wsj  in a recent interview that he hopes to expand the mba program by as much as    percent  to     students  in order to take advantage of economies of scale </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dammon told the wsj that he thinks the curriculum changes will actually strengthen the school s reputation as a quantitative powerhouse   it s a matter of embedding opportunities for students to develop their communication and leadership skills within other courses   he said   in our electives  which  are  analytically focused  we will give students opportunities to present  to do projects  you can do the best analysis in the world on a problem  but you re going to have no effect on anybody if you can t communicate what it is you ve done  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he also indicated that the decision to push core courses on disciplines like finance  marketing and operations to earlier in the first semester was driven by pressure from recruiters to interview students for internships earlier and earlier   they would love to come in the first week of classes if they could   dammon told the wsj   students were not really getting exposure to the material before sitting in interviews   in response  the school now offers a new orientation program called basecamp designed to give students an integrated view of business before they meet with recruiters   instead of learning just finance  or just marketing  or just operations  they re getting how all these things fit together   dammon said </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg dean provides life  career advice to part time mba students</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>speaking recently as part of student organized speaker series at the kellogg school of management s saturday mba program  kellogg dean sally blount advised students that true leadership begins with strong  inspired work and is supported by building relationships and fostering dialog </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you want to be known as a person who makes things happen  but does so in an understated  collaborative way   she told the part time students   people want to work with people like this  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before becoming dean of kellogg in       blount held positions at the university of chicago booth school of business and new york university s stern school of business  and in these and other positions she eventually learned to follow her inner instincts rather than cater to social expectations  she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i ve been rewarded every time i ve hunkered down and done what i believe in   she said   that has to be our goal   to do work out of passion  love and belief  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>blount also encouraged building real relationships rather than simply networking   building relationships creates reasons to follow up   she said  stressing that mindful and consistent personal connections are much more meaningful than widespread networking through social networks like facebook and linkedin </paragraph>
    <paragraph> networking may be in vogue  but she was clear that relationship building is really where long term success lies   said kellogg student mohan kompella  who helped organize the speaking event  in a post talk q a session  blount also stressed that true leaders need to set realistic work life expectations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the idea of relationship building and her challenge for us to understand all phases of our lives and the tradeoffs that might have to be made were important words to hear   kompella continued </paragraph>

  <title>oxford s said business school to launch new       specialized master s and mba program</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>peter tufano  the newly appointed dean of the said business school at the university of oxford  wants to ensure that the u k  school can compete with the best u s  business schools  which is part of why he s rolling out a new one year  combined master s degree mba program  the financial times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tufano  who heralds from harvard business school  says the new       program  as it is being called  is about  depth plus breadth   participating students will be able to dive into a specialized subject   such as environmental management or education   while also obtaining the breadth of a business degree   the choice has been between one year or two  for an mba   now you can do one or two  but a different two   tufano told the ft  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the university is in the final stages of approval for the new combined program  and an initial four departments   geography and the environment  education  computer science and the oxford internet institute   hope to enroll students in       according to tufano  most of the     year long postgraduate master s programs at oxford could be potential future program partners </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new program is designed to provide students with an option similar to two year mba programs at top u s  schools  in which they get to choose from a wide range of electives after completing core business courses  because fees for master s degrees are lower than for an mba  the total cost of the     program at oxford will come in at up to         less than the cost of a two year mba at harvard or wharton   somewhere between          and           according to the ft report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the move toward combining general business study with specialized master s programs is a growing trend  other schools such as the indian business school  the ross school of business at the university of michigan and stanford graduate school of business have all adopted similar approaches in recent years  at stanford  one in six mba students are currently enrolled in combined programs  a number dean garth saloner hopes to see move toward one in four </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business exclusive academic period ends</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>acronyms abound at stanford graduate school of business  gsb   and an important one is eap  which stands for exclusive academic period  what s that  you ask  eap refers to the first six weeks of school  when first year mba students are supposed to place an exclusive focus on their academics </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s  kind of a  no fly zone  where organized extracurricular activities are put off until after midterm exams   writes allison davis  associate director of mba admissions  in a recent post to the stanford mba admissions blog   the idea is that incoming students can get used to being back in school without having to juggle a full calendar   davis continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>eap came to a close at the gsb on november  st  and without missing a beat students organized a huge student activities fair on november  nd  where all the student clubs came out to recruit  more than    clubs were represented  ranging from the africa business club  the energy club  the rugby club  and even gsb dogs   a group for gsb dogs  dog owners and dog lovers    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond providing an introduction to the staggering array of clubs and activities available to join  the fair also gave students a chance to sign up to be matched with alumni mentors  to join the women s entrepreneurship mentoring program  or to become an arbuckle leadership fellow  where they ll get advanced leadership training and coach other students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  all of these options can contribute to another acronym at the gsb  davis warns  something called fomo or  fear of missing out   as at so many top business schools  students at stanford gsb sometimes struggle with how to decide how to spend their time  she says  about the student activities fair   it was a veritable smorgasbord and reminded me how much of the richness of the learning here occurs outside the classroom   says davis </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business receives largest ever alumni gift to combat poverty in emerging markets</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  has received the largest gift in its history       million from alumnus robert king  mba      and his wife dorothy  to focus on alleviating poverty in emerging markets  the financial times reports  the generous gift will establish the institute for innovation in developing economies  charged with finding ways to apply the entrepreneurial skills of the school s students to spur economic growth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to king and his wife  their interest in developing economies was an outgrowth of hosting some of stanford s international students in their home  including a chinese student who was instrumental in founding baidu  a chinese language search engine  king s venture investment firm  peninsular capital  provided seed money to baidu  which has since grown into an internet giant employing more than        people in china </paragraph>
    <paragraph>king says that providing seed money or microfinancing will not be the primary focus of this new venture with stanford gsb  which will instead focus on growing established businesses   one of the challenges is to take businesses to scale   king told the ft   it s the on the ground work that really excites me  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new institute will work with not for profit organizations  ngos and entrepreneurs in developing countries  and stanford mba students will be encouraged to participate in related projects between their first and second years of study  according to the ft report  in addition to this on the ground work  the institute also will focus on academic research and teaching through courses for stanford students and alumni as well as for entrepreneurs from developing countries  whose study in california the institute will fund </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the end goal here is poverty alleviation and capacity building for stanford university   dean garth saloner told the ft  he added that the multidisciplinary approach of the center   although housed at the business school  every department of the university could be involved   distinguishes it from other initiatives   i do think directionally that this  alleviating poverty in developing economies  is the sort of activity that people do not usually associate with a business school   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft article notes that stanford has been leading the way among top business school in developing interdisciplinary teaching in response to growing recognition that public policy  law and regulation increasingly inform business decisions  according to the ft report  one in six stanford mba students are part of a double degree program  also working toward degrees in engineering  law  or public policy  saloner told the ft that he hopes to increase that number to one in four </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft reports that the agreement between stanford gsb and the kings took    months to negotiate  the kings have given      million to fund the institute and committed an additional     million in matched funding in an effort to involve other donors in the project </paragraph>

    <paragraph>some test preparation experts believe that the new gmat exam  which the graduate management admissions council  gmac  will introduce in june       could require test takers to study for as much as    to    extra hours in order to obtain high scores  according to an article in the financial times this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new gmat exam will replace one of the two essay questions that is part of the existing exam with an integrative reasoning test featuring four more types of questions than the current quantitative and verbal sections  andrew mitchell  director of pre business programs at test preparation firm kaplan  is warning prospective applicants that are planning to take the new exam that they could need to prepare for longer to get a high score  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to gmac s own research  test takers currently study an average of     hours in preparation for the gmat  mitchell told the ft that he believes this could potentially rise to     or     hours with the new test  the ft article acknowledged that kaplan makes its money from would be mbas and therefore has a vested interest in promoting test preparation  mitchell  for his part  stressed that busy applicants who plan to submit their applications toward the end of      for      entry could face real concerns if they wait until the last minute to take the test   people applying next fall may not be aware of the issues   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft article noted that the graduate record examination  gre  is increasingly being accepted by business schools as an alternate entry test to the mba  the gre also changed its examination and scoring system  in august of this past year  though test takers who has sat the new exam have not yet received their scores  a recent kaplan poll of more than     business schools found that more than    percent accept the gre as well as the gmat  the ft reports  but according to kaplan s mitchell  the number of applicants submitting gre scores is very small   the gmat sends a strong signal that you are interested in business   mitchell told the ft </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg school of management hosts innovating social change conference</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this month  the kellogg school of management at northwestern university hosted a daylong social impact conference featuring seth goldman  honest tea co founder and president  as keynote </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the next generation of social impact  was the theme of this year s innovating social change conference  which took place at kellogg on october   th  the annual conference  now in its   th year  is one of several student led events at kellogg   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>honest tea s goldman encouraged conference attendees to target business practices toward social responsibility rather than making social impact a sideline consideration   if you make     million and do something nice with    million  you ve missed the mark   he said  coca cola  recognizing that environmental consciousness and social responsibility were becoming more important to their consumers  in march      acquired honest tea  which has a recognized commitment to natural ingredients and fair trade practices  according to goldman  coke s acquisition was as much for honest tea s brand message as it was to round out its beverage line up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the conference also featured a range of panel discussions  including one entitled  money vs  talent  achieving scale in social impact  moderated by kellogg lecturer of social enterprise jason saul  saul noted that more and more large corporations  like coca cola  are recognizing that their consumers are demanding more social responsibility   companies are trying to bottle  package and sell social impact   saul said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>panelists   such as liam krehbiel      founder and ceo of venture philanthropy fund a better chicago   shared ways to harness corporate interest to increase the impact of social responsibility  on behalf of corporations  krehbiel s organization researches the best education nonprofits in the area to help companies achieve a greater impact   they trust us to find the best organizations and make an impact with pooled resources   krehbiel said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mission and message of the recent conference dovetails with kellogg s new  think bravely  campaign  which suggests that to truly impact the world  future business leaders must couple strong business savvy with social responsibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darell hammond  founder of kaboom   which uses corporate donations and employee volunteerism to build playgrounds  urged kellogg students attending the conference to carry what they d learned with them regardless of where their careers were headed   everything you touch  make better   he said   you don t have to start a company to do that  </paragraph>

  <title>top business schools combine admissions for full time  part time  executive mba programs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>duke university s fuqua school of business  columbia business school  cbs   northwestern s kellogg school of management and spain s ie business school are among top mba programs that are introducing a combined admissions process in which students who get rejected from a full time mba program can more easily be offered admission to a part time or executive mba offering instead  the financial times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through combined admissions  schools can look for applicants whose profiles may not be strong enough to secure a spot in the full time mba program but who might be well suited for the part time or executive mba programs  for example  students with low gmat scores but valuable work experience could be admitted to the emba cohort at certain programs instead of the full time mba program  admissions officials told the ft  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools that embrace combined admissions are able to merge the admissions functions of different programs within the school  realizing cost savings and better meeting their recruiting targets by being able to market the traditional full time mba as well as the part time and executive programs to applicants to ensure that each student finds a fit with one program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at cbs  for example  vice dean amir ziv helped centralize admissions two years ago  before then  the full time mba and emba were separate divisions and instead of co operating they were almost competing  for students    ziv told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at ie  meanwhile  the new system helps direct highly qualified students who may not gain admission to the full time mba program to consider alternate programs instead  strong candidates who are turned down for ie s flagship international mba program now undergo a more formal counseling process about which other programs could be a fit  lisa bevil  director of full time admissions  told the ft  ten percent of students who applied to one program now study in another as a result of the new system  she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the university of michigan s ross school of business combined admissions two years ago  and since then     students have applied to the part time program instead of the emba after receiving advice from admissions counselors about better fit  ross director of admissions soojin koh told the ft   they would have all applied to the emba and probably would have not been admitted  because they had mis evaluated their experience   koh said  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>combined admissions is also helping schools cut costs   we didn t have shared accountability for the enrolment results       there was no formal process for cross selling and there was no co ordinated marketing plan   liz riley hargrove  associate dean for admission at duke  told the ft about the school s previous system  now   we save a significant amount of money just by co ordinating the  recruiting  schedule   she added  </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s graham richmond featured in bloomberg businessweek article on school selection</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how do you choose between two top mba programs when you ve been admitted by both  tough problem to have  right  in a bloomberg businessweek article this week  clear admit co founder graham richmond provides mba applicants facing this desirable and yet real dilemma with sage advice on how to make the most strategic decision </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once they re in  applicants can ask tougher questions of school officials  richmond told bloomberg bw  for example  with your fate no longer in the hands of the admissions committee  you can go ahead and request that career services provide you with a list of alumni working in your target industry  he says  you can also take advantage of admitted students  weekends and alumni club gatherings in your area to get a better sense of the real school  he adds  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>admitted applicants should also avoid letting school rankings influence their decision unduly  richmond cautions  though rankings can still help identify up and coming schools  they shouldn t define your ultimate decision  he says   it takes a lot of courage to fly in the face of the rankings and go to the school that would be best for you   he told bloomberg bw  but it can be a mistake to start reconsidering your first choice school just because you get accepted at a higher ranked institution </paragraph>
    <paragraph>much more important than a school s ranking is how it will help you achieve your personal goals for the future  a great way to help determine which program will be most successful at placing you in the kind of job you want is to schedule informational interviews with dream employers to ask what they think of the programs you are deciding between  richmond suggests </paragraph>

    <paragraph>sheryl dirks  association dean for career management at fuqua  attributed the rising employment figures to collaboration across fuqua between the cmc  student clubs  regional offices  alumni engagement teams and the mba association   but far more than fuqua s efforts as an organization  these terrific results reflect the hard work by the students themselves   she continued   while we have an obligation to put in place the right resources  it is ultimately students  efforts that dictate these numbers and this class excelled in that regard  </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan launches new management flight simulator focused on sustainability in the fish industry</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a management professor at the mit sloan school of management has created a new web based flight simulation to instruct mbas about the challenges of sustainably managing the fishing industry  and through the mit sloan teaching innovation resources  mstir  website  teachers and students everywhere can try it out for free </paragraph>
    <paragraph>called  fishbanks   the new flight simulator lets individuals or teams confront firsthand what it s like to be a leader in the fishing industry  having to balance the need to compete against the need to limit your total catch in order to sustain the fishery for future generations  designed by sloan professor john sterman  the game can be played in a single session or over the course of a semester  it was adapted and updated from a board game originally created by former mit sloan professor and alumnus dennis meadows </paragraph>
    <paragraph> management flight simulators such as fishbanks bring an experiential aspect to learning about complex systems   sterman  who also directs the mit system dynamics group  said in a statement   they have more impact than simply listening to a lecture or engaging in a case study discussion  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mstir website features other management flight simulators as well  including salt seller  a commodity pricing simulation  eclipsing the competition  a solar photovoltaic industry simulation  and the soon to be released platform wars  a video game industry simulation  free for anyone to use  each offers video user guides and online instructions for students as well as video teaching notes and slides covering all aspects of the simulation for faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sloan s sterman has been developing management flight simulators since the     s and notes that mit has been a pioneer among business schools in the field of action learning  which comprises a key element in many mit sloan classes and laboratories </paragraph>
    <paragraph> deep  actionable knowledge and decision making skills develop when people have the chance to apply classroom theory in the real world with its messy complexity  time pressure and irreversible consequences   sterman says   but project based action learning in the field is not possible in settings where the stakes are high or the consequences of decisions unfold over years or decades  for many of the critical issues we face  simulation becomes the main way we can discover for ourselves how complex systems work and develop the management and leadership skills we need to succeed  </paragraph>

    <paragraph> we have seen more and more applicants with three year bachelor s degrees like the new european standard   read the mba insider blog  while the standard for graduate admission remains a four year degree or its equivalent  anderson s admissions office states that it will now use its discretion to admit candidates with three year undergraduate degrees provided their overall academic profile and application are strong enough </paragraph>
    <paragraph>likewise  anderson will continue to require a toefl or ielts score from most international applicants to demonstrate english fluency but will now allow for some exceptions   we will consider applications from those without toefl or ielts scores if the candidate earned a degree where the sole language of instruction was english   the mba insider blog read   this means that applicants from countries such as india and singapore no longer have to take the language test if they were schooled in english   the post continued  anderson will use a range of indicators   other verbal scores  essays  etc    to ensure that all members of the incoming class are completely fluent in english  and a toefl or ielts score remains  the best way for international applicants to ensure competitiveness in our evaluation process   the post stressed </paragraph>

  <title>stanford mba admissions director shares admissions tips in wall street journal interview</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the wall street journal this week ran excerpts from an interesting interview with derrick bolton  assistant dean and director of mba admissions at stanford university s graduate school of business  with an acceptance rate of just   percent for this fall s incoming class  stanford is one of the most competitive mba programs out there  so it pays to pay attention when bolton shares his thoughts on the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bolton  himself a stanford grad  mba       revealed in the interview with the journal that his team will not put an application aside in the event that a prospective applicant s gmat score is below a certain number   that would rob us of a lot of talent   he says  his team uses the gmat as a helpful indicator of how prospective applicants can perform in the first year  but they take a holistic approach  reviewing each candidate from an academic  professional and personal perspective  of course  that places on candidates the difficult job of opening up and telling their whole story to a group of strangers  he adds  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to whether he thinks admissions consultants aid candidates in the admissions process  bolton acknowledged that some candidates look to consultants to provide coaching or guidance that they are in a unique position to deliver having worked with a wide range of other candidates  applicants should ask themselves   how can someone who doesn t know you help you be a more authentic version of yourself   bolton advises  he allows that consultants who are asking the right questions probably can do just that </paragraph>
    <paragraph>candidates can get too caught up worrying about scores and essays  he says  but instead they should spend more time thinking about who they ask to serve as references   they often think about it from the perspective of   i need to pick three references who show different aspects of my personality   not from the perspective of   i need to pick three people who are going to be my strongest advocates    bolton says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to the diversity of the stanford gsb class  bolton attributes it to the fact that he makes     individual decisions rather than checking boxes with regard to industry mix  gender or anything else   if i m doing my job well  in terms of bringing in people who think about the world in different ways  it necessarily will reflect itself in the check the box metrics   he says </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business tops aspen institute s beyond grey pinstripes ranking</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  last week reclaimed the number one spot in the aspen institute s biennial beyond grey pinstripes rankings  an alternative ranking that compares business schools according to how well they teach mba students to look at the social  environmental and ethical impacts of business decisions  this year s rankings were released on september   st </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in all scoring categories used to determine the ranking  business schools have raised the bar   judith samuelson  executive director of the aspen institute business and society program  which conducted beyond grey pinstripes  said in a statement  she noted that there are more courses than ever before featuring content on social  ethical and environmental issues  more courses about the role of business as a positive agent for change and more research published by faculty on relevant topics  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gsb slipped to fourth place in the last beyond grey pinstripes ranking in       having held the top spot in      and       but the palo alto school rose to the top again this year as a result of having numerous course offerings with social and environmental content  additional courses that explicitly address the role of mainstream business in improving social and environmental conditions and an environment in which faculty feel free to explore social and environmental topics in their research </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the top    schools in this year s ranking were as follow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   stanford graduate school of business    york university  schulich school of business  canada     ie university  spain     notre dame  mendoza college of business    yale school of management    northwestern  kellogg school of management    university of michigan  ross school of business    cornell university  johnson graduate school of management    university of north carolina  kenan flagler business school     uc berkeley  haas school of business</paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a press release announcing the rankings  samuelson noted that the      survey represented the first opportunity since the global economic downturn to measure whether and how mba programs have changed their course content as a result   in the wake of the financial crisis we re seeing an increased willingness to address these issues   she said   that willingness is coming from a variety of factors  including student demand  faculty readiness and a desire on the part of business schools to clarify what exactly they re doing to prepare business leaders to serve the needs of society  such as job creation and energy conservation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to be considered as part of the rankings  business schools were asked to submit detailed course descriptions and faculty research abstracts  as well as information about extracurricular activities  institutes and centers  joint degrees and specializations  for the           beyond grey pinstripes rankings      schools from    countries submitted data  the aspen institute project team spent seven months analyzing the data to arrive at the rankings </paragraph>

  <title>u penn s wharton school tests new team based discussion component for potential future inclusion in application process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning this winter  some mba applicants to the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania will be randomly selected to take part in a discussion with fellow applicants as part of the application process  according to recent reports in the wall street journal and daily pennsylvanian  dp  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this supplemental team based exercise will have no effect on admissions this year  according to ankur kumar  wharton director of mba admissions and financial aid  the new discussion format component is designed to help highlight applicants  interpersonal skills  intellectual curiosity  leadership  teamwork  problem solving and critical thinking  kumar told the dp  she hopes it will  actually bring to life off the page who  the candidates  are and showcase that to us   she added   the new discussion component will focus on applicants  general knowledge   not their business experience  kumar said  this year s test will help determine whether discussions will become a permanent fixture in the mba admissions process  she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton vice dean of innovation karl ulrich thinks wharton s current applications may not allow reliable assessment of applicants based on all qualities  according to the dp report   wharton receives enough applicants with excellent grades  work experience  and gmat scores to fill its class many times over   the team discussion format lets us observe and evaluate applicants in an unstructured format  which we believe will allow us to more reliably assess applicants   he wrote in an e mail to the dp </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students in past wharton mba classes have participated in mock discussions after admission to the mba class  the dp report added       wharton mba graduate ayo omojola participated in a discussion group featuring six to seven students discussing a general knowledge topic and seeking to reach consensus while admissions team observers watched  omojola told the dp that he thinks incorporating discussions into the admissions process will better allow the wharton admissions team to get to know candidates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kumar stressed that the new discussion component should not contribute to any anxiety among current applicants since it is still in its initial testing stages </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit s team of admissions specialists sees promise in the new wharton discussion component  which represents a major break from tradition  in which the application has been a one way dialog between the admissions committee and the applicant </paragraph>
    <paragraph> mckinsey uses the group interview method as a screening tool in final interview rounds   says clear admit senior admissions counselor stacey oyler  who worked in admissions at dartmouth s tuck school of business and as a recruiter for mckinsey before joining the clear admit team </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we ll keep tabs on these and other admissions developments and help applicants be as prepared as possible for any future changes  so be sure to watch this space </paragraph>

  <title>one year specialized master s degree application volume grows as mba volume declines</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the number of prospective applicants to specialized master s programs in finance and management grew this year  even as mba application volume fell off at many schools  the graduate management admission council  gmac  reported this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to gmac s annual application trends survey  about two thirds of two year  full time mba programs reported decreases in application volume  on average  applications for these programs fell     percent over       but other mba programs   including the majority of part time and executive mba programs   reported that their application levels remained the same or rose in      as compared with       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specialized master s programs  in contrast  experienced significant gains  eighty three percent of master s programs in finance report applications are up  followed by    percent of master s in management and    percent of master s in accounting programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a wall street journal article on application volumes attributed the increased application volume for these shorter  specialized programs to undergraduates hoping to increase their credentials before hitting the job market and to tougher entry requirements by professional certification boards  for example  the journal offered  students who want to become certified public accountants in certain states must now have     hours of college credit to qualify for the cpa exam  more than most get in an undergraduate program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but for full time programs  even the very top schools weren t immune to a drop off in application volume  applications to harvard business school  hbs  s full time mba program fell by   percent  to        from a year earlier </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  for prospective mba applicants  this news could mean that right now represents a great time to apply  the reduced application volume helped boost hbs s acceptance rate to    percent this year  up from    percent in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mba applicant pool is also growing more and more international  the trends survey found  nearly half     percent  of the     business schools who participated reported an increase in the number of overseas students  most notably from india and china </paragraph>

    <author>GMAT - AWA</author>
  </authors>
  <title>gmat tips   the awa isn t that important  so can i blow it off </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>today s gmat tip comes from our friends at knewton    in       this article  they provide helpful advice on how to approach the awa section of the gmat   read on to see  what  they  have to say </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i want to take a moment to address some common confusion about the  analytical writing assessment  awa  portion of the gmat exam   as many  of you inveterate students know  the awa portion involves two essays   and you get a maximum of    minutes for each essay   and no  you don t  get    minutes for the second essay if the first only takes you     minutes   as i like to say    there are no rollover minutes   this is  verizon  not at t    also  the essays are always the first section  of the exam  although the ordering of the essays may vary </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but many of you also probably know that the essay portion is not  nearly as consequential as the multiple choice portions   the essays are  not part of your     composite score and are instead scored on  a separate scale out of     in decrements of       generally   admissions committees use the essay scores to judge whether or not you  actually wrote your application essays to the school   if you write a  fantastic admissions essay filled with prose worthy of a pulitzer but  get a     awa score  the admissions committee s going to be suspicious </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but in the end  your composite score out of     weighs much more  heavily on the committee s collective mind   it s easy  then  to come up  with arguments for blowing off the essay and focusing the bulk of your  attention on the multiple choice sections   but is this really wise </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one time  a student told me that he was going to take the gmat a  second time   the first time he took the test  he didn t achieve his  desired composite score   but he got a perfect     on the awa   so in  his mind  this justified the following strategy    i m going to  completely skip the essays the next time i take the test   it s not  important anyway  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several students have suggested similar strategies to me  and i  understood where they were coming from   skipping the essays outright  makes the test shorter and allows you to conserve some mental energy for  the multiple choice sections   but consider the following scenario    you re on the admissions committee of a prestigious business school    you re reviewing an applicant  and you see that he got a     awa on the  gmat on his first try  but got a     the second time   you don t like  the sight of the      and although you recognize that the applicant has  the capability to score a      it s readily apparent  at least in your  mind  that the applicant feels cocky or lax enough to blow a whole  section of the test off and just assume that it won t matter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  it may be true that some individual committees won t care as  much   but are you willing to take that risk   what if you re applying  to a competitive school that requires you to present every advantage you  can   allowing a     to show up on your transcript doesn t seem very  prudent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>besides  does the one hour of essay writing really drain you of so  much energy that it makes a statistically significant difference on your  performance for the rest of the test   you might assume the answer is  yes   but it s a pretty tenuous generalization   if you took the gmat  hundreds of times with the awa and hundreds of times without  maybe we d  have some statistical data to go on   but as is  assuming the awa will  take away your mojo so much that your score will drop by a significant  margin is unfounded speculation at best </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another thing to keep in mind   some students actually like the  essays  because they allow you to shake off initial nerves   you get the  least important part of the test out of the way first  and by the time  you re done  you ve settled into a groove and gotten used to your  surroundings   for some students  this allows them to transition into  the multiple choice sections more relaxed and clear minded   this might  be the case for you too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so all in all  you might in theory be able to get away with blowing  off the essays   but all things considered  it s not a risk worth  taking  and a poor or nonexistent awa score will not look good to  admissions committees   the essays are the least consequential part of  the test  so investing just a little bit of time and energy in them  should not have a great effect on your composite score </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school admissions director provides assorted updates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in case you missed it  harvard business school  hbs  dean of admissions dee leopold provided an array of miscellaneous updates regarding the admissions process in a post to her director s blog last week  included was new information about transcripts  class visits and upcoming events  as well as information that leopold feels bears repeating with regard to letters of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there has been a change this admissions season at hbs as far as transcripts are concerned  leopold reminded prospective applicants   we are requiring that all transcripts be uploaded this year   she wrote  that means no more templates for applicants to fill in their grades  the shift is intended to make verification after admission easier for hbs   yes  you can scan and upload   leopold wrote  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also called attention to the fact that there are still a couple of remaining information sessions in boston  los angeles and several international cities for prospective applicants hoping to learn more about hbs and the admissions process  these events  like others that have preceded them  will feature student and alumni panels  time for q a about admissions and more  for a full list of remaining information sessions and locations  click here </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold apologized that it is still hard to secure a spot for class visits despite the fact that hbs has opened up second year classes to visitors for the first time this year   i wish it were easier   she wrote   if you find yourself closed out of a class  it still may be worthwhile visiting  we ll have information sessions led by the admissions board  tours led by students and lots of places you can wander and strike up conversations with students  and really good food  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the news on recommendations is old  leopold simply wanted to reassure prospective applicants that hbs does not require recommendations from current supervisors   if it s possible  we strongly advise it  if it s not  just drop a brief explanation in the  additional information  section of the application   she wrote  she went on to add that though they don t ask for a peer rec  she acknowledges that they can be very important in some cases  such as when you re trying to tell the admissions committee about a venture you started in college or beyond  finally  for applicants who work for family businesses  leopold advised making your best call on how to handle it   it s rare that your mom or dad can be objective  although i ve certainly seen a few very frank ones   so you ll need to explore other options   she wrote  but she stressed that hbs likes having the family business perspective in the classroom  so applicants in this position should not let it deter them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in closing  leopold challenged herself to add a new feature to her blog entries  namely a weekly interview with a current student  perhaps alternating between first and second years   i m going to be interviewing one person each week on thursday at    p m  and asking about their day  and what s ahead between now and bedtime   she wrote  the interviews will be posted on fridays starting in mid september </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we look forward to them </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>a professor of marketing at the tuck school of business at dartmouth university took home this year s excellence in global marketing research award from the american marketing association  ama   the school announced this week  professor peter golder received the award on august  th for a      journal of marketing research article introducing the concept of near market knowledge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>near market knowledge is a concept designed to help firms better understand market entry decisions by reflecting the knowledge they generate by operating in markets that are culturally and economically similar  the study s findings suggest that today s expanding companies should consider developing experience in foreign markets as a basis for entering other similar markets  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> entering foreign markets is a key component of the growth strategy of most firms   golder said in a statement  adding that many firms nonetheless fail in these efforts   the most successful companies leverage their experiences in other similar foreign markets  without such experiences  companies are better off gaining experience in smaller markets prior to entering larger  similar markets   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the purposes of the study  golder and co author debanjan mitra compiled extensive data on the foreign market entries of    multinational firms  the ama award recognizes golder as the author of an outstanding research article based on the long term impact of its findings </paragraph>

  <title>washington post story on mba admissions features clear admit</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in case you missed it  there was a great piece in both the print and online versions of the washington post this past weekend on mba admissions  the piece  entitled  would you climb any mountain to get into mba program of your dreams   ran in sunday s post and featured quotes and input from clear admit co founder graham richmond on how applicants to top mba programs can help make themselves stand out among the thousands and thousands of applications the very best schools receive </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the most important things is to understand who will be reading your application  richmond told the post   the people reading the file are more like your high school english teacher than the colleague sitting next to you at an investment bank   he said  adding that they are more interested in getting a good sense of who you are than your business experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that s why richmond advised a recent applicant to wharton to write an essay about learning how to shoot guns in order to fit into the male dominated southern based private equity firm where she worked </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the post story focused on the intangibles   the things beyond gpa and gmat score that help demonstrate managerial  entrepreneurial and or social skills that can distinguish individual applicants   the intangibles are incredibly important   george andrews  associate dean at the university of chicago s booth school  told the post  adding that it s these qualities that also help admissions officers build a diverse class </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the post article also cited some of the strategies students have used to demonstrate these types of qualities  such as showcasing start ups or nonprofits they ve helped found or volunteer programs they ve participated with as part of their applications </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here  too  richmond provided some important advice to applicants  namely that you need to make sure that whatever you choose to highlight shows sincerity and commitment  in other words  picking up a last minute volunteer gig with a soup kitchen just before the application deadline may not carry much weight   the candidate who starts doing something right before application can look fishy   he told the post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>admissions officials from several top schools  including wharton  stanford and georgetown  also chimed in with useful pointers for prospective applicants  if you are currently applying to business school or considering applying in the near future  you ll probably want to check out the piece for yourself  to read it in its entirety  click here </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school offers visits to second year classes in september</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with the round   deadline for the class of      just    days away  harvard business school  hbs  has opted to open up a small number of second year classes to visitors in september  the traditional first year class visit program doesn t begin until october  after round   applicants will have submitted their applications </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we have always focused our class visit program on the first year classroom   wrote hbs dean of admissions and financial aid in a post to her director s blog   the downside of this is that our faculty like to let the new students settle in a bit before welcoming visitors  that doesn t dovetail very nicely with our october  rd application deadline   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to give prospective round   applicants a chance to see an hbs class in order to assess whether they would like to apply  hbswill open up a limited number of spaces in second year classes for visitors in september   i think visitors will find this a great opportunity to see the case method in action   and get a glimpse of our second year students   leopold wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the entire hbs second year is an elective curriculum  versus the required curriculum that makes up the first year  and visitors to these classes will not see students in the    person sections that comprise the first year classes  for applicants to later rounds  first year class visits will resume on october  rd </paragraph>
    <paragraph>look for detailed instructions on how to arrange a second year class visit on the hbs website this week  leopold wrote  a fall schedule for information sessions and campus tours will be posted at the same time  she added </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>in a letter last week to current students at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  dean tom robertson shared that j j  cutler  deputy vice dean of mba career management  admissions and financial aid  will be leaving the school to take a senior management position at aramark   this is a wonderful opportunity for j j   and although we are  of course  sorry to see him go  we are confident that his active  integrative leadership and his cultivation of talented senior managers in the mba program administration have left us stronger than ever going forward   robertson wrote </paragraph>

    <paragraph> this past year  as a member of the leadership team overseeing all mbacm advisors  maryellen led us to the highest student satisfaction scores in seven years  in part by implementing the net promoter score  nps  process which is measured after each advising appointment   cutler wrote  he added that lamb has also helped enhance wharton s recruiting strategy to increase opportunities for both students and employers  which has resulted in significant improvements in both the employment rate and average salary for the class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cutler  a      graduate of the wharton mba program  pledged to remain an active member of the alumni community as he pursues his next challenge  we will miss him in his role at wharton but wish him the best going forward  watch this space for an interview in the coming days with wharton admission officials about the staffing transition </paragraph>

  <title>concerns about increasingly younger mba classes prove unfounded  financial times reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with mba programs at schools like harvard business school  hbs  adopting deferred admissions programs designed to attract prospective college applicants  rumors have been circulating for the past several years that business schools are seeking to enroll younger classes  in fact  according to a recent article in the financial times  these rumors have proven misplaced and the average age of incoming students has hovered around    for most u s  two year programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the concern that business schools planned to enroll younger classes was sparked in great part by hbs s launch of its     program  which targets promising college students  who if accepted are guaranteed a spot in the hbs class after completing two years of approved work experience  this represents a shift from the average five years of experience that most top tier schools have usually wanted to see from applicants  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with its     program  hbs has hoped to attract bright young students earlier  before they venture down another career path or followed an alternate graduate school direction  schools have also argued that targeting younger students could help increase female enrollment  making the timeframe for attendance more analogous to law or medical school and less in conflict with the years when many women choose to start a family </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but despite concerns that     would result in a younger  less experienced class  a third of the first entries from the program  who will join hbs later this year  have decided to further defer business school  that leaves    participants from the program entering this year out of a class of     students  hbs dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold told the ft that there were no strict rules about students joining in a given year and participants are welcome to work for additional years if they choose </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the simon school at the university of rochester  which also launched an  early leaders  initiative a few years ago  the average age has risen back to    after dipping to     at simon  the young leaders program is credited with increasing the number of female applicants  according to the ft report  about    per cent of those designated as young leaders are women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the increase in women entering top tier mba programs has been particularly significant this year at a range of schools  at hbs  the female students increased from    to    percent  and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania tops the chart  with a    percent female intake this year  up from    percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but at wharton  admissions officials maintain that significant work experience   including in managerial roles   is key to recruiters   all the feedback from employers is that they want work experience    j j  cutler  wharton director of mba admissions and financial aid  told the ft   we want a mature  diverse class   according to cutler     per cent of the class of     at wharton have four or more years of work experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite its commitment to significant work experience  wharton has begun to talk to young women in high schools as well as colleges to persuade them of the value of a business education  dean tom robertson believes that having more women in the class this year will draw more women in subsequent years   there is a critical mass issue   he told the ft   women feel there is a critical mass of women  at wharton   </paragraph>
