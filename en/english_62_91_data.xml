  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  piloted a new interview process in round    compressing the timeline to four weeks and notifying applicants who were not admitted sooner than in past years </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this pilot was in response to applicants  feedback that if the answer is a definite  no   you d rather know earlier to save you from spending months obsessively refreshing your email and calculating your odds as well as to give you more time to work on applications for other schools   read a recent post on the stanford mba admissions blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pilot was considered a success  so stanford is continuing with a similar timeline for round    all interview invitations will be issued between february  rd and march  th  none before and none after   we expect to issue the majority of invitations by february   th   read the admissions blog entry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the admissions team hopes that providing some certainty around the timing of interview invitations will help make the waiting a little easier </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck from those of us here at clear admit to those of you who submitted applications as part of stanford s round    remember that you can share your interview experiences and learn from those of others as part of clear admit s interview reports archive </paragraph>

  <title>    million alumni gift establish new family business initiative at cornell s johnson graduate school of management</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an alumnus who credits his own mba with the fact that his family business remained in the family and prospered has given     million to cornell university s samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management to establish a new family business initiative at the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gift  from john smith  mba      and his spouse dyan  will create the john and dyan smith family business initiative  which will be housed in johnson s entrepreneurship and innovation institute </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the smith s gift will endow the john and dyan smith professorship of management and family business  the recipient of which will serve as the initiative s lead faculty member  it also will endow the smith family clinical professorship of management  whose recipient will serve as director of the initiative </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  it establishes the smith family research  program and faculty support fund  which will support a range of activities including academic courses  student and alumni programming  marketing and outreach  presentations by visiting executive speakers and faculty recruitment </paragraph>
    <paragraph> with the smith s generous gift  we can now put in place a systematic program to help prepare students for starting  scaling and managing a family business   johnson dean soumitra dutta said in a statement   the smith family business initiative will have a profound and lasting impact on family business and graduate business education at johnson and cornell  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>smith believes that the education he received at cornell s then graduate school of business and public administration  bpa  helped him prepare for the federal deregulation of his family s freight trucking business and enabled that business crst international of cedar rapids  iowa to emerge as one of the    largest u s  truckload concerns while remaining within the family </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you have no concept of what the competitive pressures are going to bring on your business in deregulation   he said in a statement   i met the right professors at cornell  who convinced me that this was going to happen  and we d better be prepared  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one of the main reasons we are moving forward with crst remaining within our family is because of education   dyan smith added   the initiative is the next step to putting johnson in the forefront of family business management  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the smiths  son ian  mba      likely will not benefit from the full range of offerings the smith family business initiative will include  although johnson is moving quickly to develop a new and innovative curriculum specific to family businesses  wesley sine  faculty director of johnson s entrepreneurship and innovation institute  is already at work on a course focusing on the benefits and challenges specific to family businesses  he is also developing the smith family distinguished family business lecture series  which will bring executives from the world s most successful family businesses to speak to students on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph> family businesses are the most common type of business on the earth  particularly in developing countries   sine said in a statement   the greater the extent to which we help family businesses across the globe be more successful  the greater our relevance and the larger our impact  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>wic are mini trips organized by various student clubs to cities across the country during school breaks  each week in cities trip is focused on a particular industry and includes scheduled visits for participating students at several companies and firms that might have internships or full time job opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mckinnon took part in a consulting focused wic trip to dallas during fuqua s fall break  his was organized by two first year students  who helped set up lodging  transportation and company visits  twenty one students took part  which meant that this wic group was on the smaller side  mckinnon notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the dallas consulting wic trip  fuqua students visited pricewaterhousecoopers  mckinsey  bain  bcg and accenture  with presentations  tours and networking opportunities at each firm  but the wic itinerary left time for sightseeing as well   strolling around dallas  arts district  trying out a local bbq place  visiting the george w  presidential library and museum </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mckinnon writes that it was well worth figuring out what wic stands for and actually going on a trip   for one  it gave me the chance to visit the offices of various firms that i m recruiting for and get a better sense for what makes each one unique  actually being in their buildings and talking with their employees helped me better understand their values and culture  and identify the firms that best align with my personal and career objectives   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>networking opportunities with employees at the various consulting firms was also a big bonus  he adds   we were able to network with and talk to far more people than we can during on campus presentations  since our group was small  we were able to get a lot more face time with the people that we will  hopefully  be working closely with this summer and beyond  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wic trips also provide fuqua students with a great chance to get to know their fellow first year students better  mckinnon notes   although we re all hoping to land internships with these companies  being together and becoming better friends has helped us band together and help each other during the recruiting process  since the trip  we ve already discussed our thoughts on the companies  shared ideas to prepare for interviews and we re doing all we can to collectively succeed  </paragraph>

  <title>tax deductions and the mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the u s  tax court recently ruled that an mba student who deducted         in tuition expenses from his      tax return owes more than        in back taxes to the internal revenue service  bloomberg businessweek reports  ouch  as follow up  bloomberg bw offers a few things to keep in mind regarding tuition deductions </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the rules for deducting educational expenses sound simple enough  tuition is deductible when it pays for coursework that enhances skills necessary for an established job or business  as well as any courses required by an employer   reads the bloomberg bw article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  even the simplest rules can quickly grow complex  for instance  what if the skills you gain through an mba not only enhance your ability to perform your current job but also qualify you to pursue a new career </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there isn t a bright line distinction that says  if you ve worked so many years  making a certain salary  you can claim the deduction   david young  a partner at young and co  in rochester  ny  told bloomberg bw  in terms of tuition deductions  if an auditor challenges the deduction  it falls on the taxpayer to prove that the mba is a business expense  young adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>doing so can be tricky  but the tax court has ruled in favor of mba candidates who have claimed tuition deductions in the past  according to the bloomberg bw report  although this most recent case  in which the court ruled that rollins college mba adam hart owes money in back taxes  may embolden auditors to pursue cases   every time the irs gets a case like this  they become more self assured   bob charron  a partner at friedman in new york  told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>large deductions  too  are more likely to attract auditors  attention  jackie perlman  principal tax analyst at the tax institute  the research and analysis division of tax prep company h r block told bloomberg bw  when in doubt  it s probably best to consult an expert  especially since taxpayers who appear to have intentionally flouted rules often face stiffer penalties  and it s hard to claim financial illiteracy as a business school student </paragraph>

  <title>latin americans flock to spain to pursue an mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in growing numbers  latin americans are turning to top business schools in spain   notably esade  ie and iese   to obtain their mbas before returning to careers in latin america  the new york times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>spain s own economy is still faltering  but business schools there say they are attracting more and more latin americans  many with international career experience  who plan to return to latin america when they graduate  according to the times report  they are drawn to spanish mba programs  according to the report  because the classrooms are more diverse than at schools in the united states and the business culture is a more familiar one  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i really feel like i made the right decision to come to europe because the whole educational system   the interaction with the professors  the interaction with the students   is so much more similar to the way that business is done in south america than what i was exposed to in the u s    brazilian native joana jo fratini told the times  she started classes at esade last year after obtaining an undergraduate economics degree from penn state university </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at esade     percent of this year s graduating class is latin american  in response to this growing contingent  esade has launched a study program called  doing business in latin america   and has decided to offer a full time mba program in spanish beginning next year  until now  the school s mba program was taught only in english </paragraph>
    <paragraph>iese  another top ranked school based in barcelona  is also making changes in response to growing numbers of latin american students  this year  with    percent of its students from latin america  iese launched an executive mba in s o paolo  brazil  which offers courses in english  portuguese and spanish for business professionals from brazil and neighboring countries </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that latin americans are showing interest in spanish schools is not surprising or even necessarily new   there are existing economic ties  a shared business culture and  for many latin americans  a shared language </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is new is the degree to which latin american students are heading to spanish mba programs with every intention of returning to latin america after graduation   there are a lot more opportunities in latin america   javier mu oz  iese director of mba career services  told the times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>xavier gimbert  who oversees latin american programs and initiatives at esade  agrees  noting that demand for qualified mbas has soared as countries in the region open up to big latin american based multinationals   if you compare colombia with five or    years ago  it is another country   he told the times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a plan to return to latin america with an mba in hand is prevalent among students at spain s ie business school as well  the majority of latin american students at ie   where they make up about    percent of the total student population   say they want to return to latin america to work  according to the times report  ie student polls reveal that as many as    percent of brazilian students and    percent of peruvian students plan to return to their home countries </paragraph>

  <title>teamwork  listening skills essential for mbas   and prospective applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>team assignments have become de rigeur as part of the mba curriculum at many leading business schools  with some schools assigning students to teams when they first arrive and requiring them to work together in multiple classes and others having students shift between several different teams as part of a single course or semester </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why such a focus on teamwork  experts believe that learning to work in small groups will pay off when the students graduate and look for jobs  according to a recent article in u s  news   world report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba students are likely to find themselves in a work environment where reaching common goals will require a group effort   whether it s launching a product in a new market or designing a strategy for a hospital to reduce the cost of its services while also improving quality  paula caproni  who teaches about creating high performing teams to mbas at the ross school of business at university of michigan  told u s  news </paragraph>
    <paragraph> many problems are far too complex for any one person to resolve  they need to learn how to depend on others   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba students who work in teams as part of business school will be much better prepared for the work world that awaits them upon graduation than peers who completed most of their projects solo  experts say  there are several important steps involved in working in a group  which students who have worked as teams will learn  at the university of miami  mba students doing consulting projects are asked to put together a charter laying out ground rules and roles right from the start  dean gene anderson of the school of business administration told u s  news </paragraph>
    <paragraph>assigning roles   who will do what  when and how   is one of the first things taught by professors who specialize in teamwork strategies  at the university of miami  mba students are sometimes put in groups to act as consultants and work as a team  says gene anderson  dean of the school of business administration  one of the first things they re asked to do is put together a charter  which lays out ground rules and roles </paragraph>
    <paragraph> who s going to act as the team leader  who s going to be the scribe  who s going to be the communications liaison to people outside the team   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>next  a team needs to focus on establishing a process   how often the team will meet  for how long  what records will be kept </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here enters another key skill mba students must develop as part of working in a team  the ability to listen  gregory patton  who teaches communication skills at the university of southern california s marshall school of business  reminds students that what they say sometimes is less important than what they hear </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we say listening to understand versus listening to argue   patton told u s  news  reminding students that understanding another group member s ideas can actually advance their own thinking </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective applicants to business school have great opportunities to practice their listening skills before even starting their mba program   any time they meet someone new  patton says   ask them three follow up questions to learn about them  don t interrupt  don t focus on yourself   he told u s  news  this approach will create a deeper relationship and also allow you to learn more  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another way prospective applicants can prepare for student team projects as part of the mba is to seek out group or team based assignments at work or while volunteering  looking for ways to learn from the experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph> while you re on those teams  be very mindful of your own behavior in that team  of what you want to learn  of how you personally are helping and hurting the team   michigan s caproni told u s  news   learn as much as you can about team dynamics  </paragraph>

  <title>few business schools  admissions decisions hinge on gmat integrated reasoning score  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a majority of business school admissions officers report that an applicant s score on the gmat s new integrated reasoning  ir  section is not currently an important part of their evaluation of a prospective student s overall gmat score  according to a recent survey by kaplan test prep </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in its      survey of business school admissions officers  kaplan found that    percent of mba programs say that they do not place significant weight on the scores applicants submit for the gmat s new ir section  which was launched in august       however  the survey did find that more than half     percent  of mba programs list a low overall gmat score as  the biggest application killer  for prospective applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmat test takers receive a separate score for the ir section  which means that even very strong performance on other sections of the exam can t mask poor performance on this section </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s not surprising that a majority of business schools are not currently placing too much importance on the integrated reasoning section  since it makes sense they d want to gather performance data on a new section before fully incorporating it into their evaluation process   lee weiss  executive director of pre business programs for kaplan test prep  said in a statement  weiss went on to point out that since gmat scores are valid for five years  not all applicants in      or      will have submitted the integrated reasoning section </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools may decide that ir should play a greater role in admissions decisions moving forward  weiss added  he cautioned that even though many business schools indicate that they are not placing significant emphasis on the new section yet  prospective applicants should still prepare for the new section as seriously as they do for the quantitative and verbal sections   it still matters   he stressed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kaplan s      survey included responses from     admissions officers from business schools across the united states  including five of the top    mba programs  as compiled by u s  news   world report </paragraph>

  <title>little change year over year in poets quants  mba rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>poets quants today released its      composite ranking of the best full time mba programs in the united states  revealing that very little has changed since last year  in fact  the top eight programs this year are exactly the same  in the same order  as they were last year  the only change among the top    schools was that ninth and tenth place last year  berkeley s haas school of business and duke university s fuqua school  flip flopped this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>p q arrives at its rankings by weighing five other leading mba rankings  bloomberg businessweek  the economist  the financial times  forbes  and u s  news   world report  the composite ranking  p q asserts  helps reduce flaws in the other rankings caused by faulty survey technique  biased methodology or other issues   the composite index tones down the noise in each of these five surveys to get more directly at the real signal that is being sent   reads the p q report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of what the  real signal  is  here are some of p q s conclusions  this year and last  harvard business school  stanford graduate school of business  the university of chicago booth school of business and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania held steady in spots one through four  but the underlying index scores in the composite ranking were especially close this year  with just fractions of a point separating the programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite the very close scores  p q pointed out that chicago booth outranked wharton for the fourth consecutive year   giving slightly more credence to the view that it is no longer harvard stanford wharton at the top   wharton was the only school among the top    to see application volume decline  it dropped     percent  for the class of       chicago booth  in contrast  reported the greatest application volume increase      percent  rendering it slightly more selective than wharton for the first time ever </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  the top    programs are having a great year  with all but one reporting an increase in mba applications  allowing most to be even more selective than usual  graduate management admission test  gmat  averages for the class of      likewise rose at nine of the ten schools  breaking records at stanford      average this year  up from      and wharton      average this year  up from      among others </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the quality of the pool is just stronger   stacey r  kole  deputy dean of the full time mba program at chicago booth  told p q   we hit a     median gmat this year  the   th percentile  there are very few people under     these days  when i got here    years ago  the average gmat was      it s a record this year at      and it s not like we just shimmied under the bar on gmat  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>undergraduate grade point averages remained pretty stable at most of the top schools  though at stanford it rose even higher  to       the highest of any u s  business school and up from      last year  chicago booth and dartmouth college s tuck school of business also reported small increases in average gpa </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you can find a little more movement year over year the farther down the rankings you look  with a few schools moving up or slipping down a spot or two  the university of michigan s ross school and the university of virginia s darden school  like haas and fuqua  swapped spots this year  to no     and no     respectively  ucla s anderson school of management climbed from no     to no      bumping nyu s stern school from no     last year down to no      yale school of management  for its part  slipped to no      down from    last year </paragraph>

  <title>analysis of an argument essay</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>today s gmat article comes from manhattan review gmat prep uae  a provider of gmat prep courses in abu dhabi and dubai  among others  in this article  they reveal manhattan review s six best points on the gmat essay  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gmat is an odd test  unlike in the lsat  the least important section  the essay  comes first  not last  however  though it s true that business schools don t pay as much attention to the essay score as to the overall verbal and quantitative score  this doesn t mean that the essay is of no importance at all  you need to take it seriously and write as good an essay as you can   here are six points to guide you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why the essay </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is important to keep in mind what the essay is and what it isn t  the essay isn t a newspaper op ed  it isn t a definitive statement on a critical issue of the hour  it isn t even an essay that you write for your professor  consider  you only have    minutes to think about  plan out  write and proof your essay  so there s a limit to what you can say and how effectively you can say it  the purpose of the essay is to enable the schools to verify that you really wrote the essays that you submitted with your application  if you sent in a beautifully crafted  eloquent essay but only managed an illiterate  ungrammatical and perfunctory essay in the gmat the school will wonder whether someone other than you wrote your application essays  the gmat essay does not have to astound anyone with its brilliance  it just has to be good enough to make sure that the school admissions officers don t start to entertain doubts as to your authenticity as a writer  keep this in mind though  while a poorly written essay could harm your cause  a well written  perhaps even outstanding one won t advance it very much  the score the business schools continue to be guided by is the main quantitative and verbal score  an adequate score for the essay will suffice  an inadequate score will hurt </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an essay  not a grocery list</paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is an essay  not an office memorandum  an e mail or a grocery list  it has to read like a narrative  like a logical progression of an argument  there can be no bullet points  numbered paragraphs  headings  underlined words  abbreviations such as w out or b c  colloquialisms  acronyms  internet slang such as lol  imho  p p  b b  fwiw and otoh  all sentences must include at least one noun and one verb  memorize words that allow you to transition from one paragraph to another such as  however    on the one hand  and  on the other hand    moreover    furthermore    in addition    consequently   and  it is possible  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>avoid inserting yourself into the essay as much as possible  there is no need for such expressions as  i think  on  in my opinion   or  i don t agree   such terms are redundant  you are the one writing the essay  the reader knows this  he or she doesn t need to be told </paragraph>
    <paragraph>critical reasoning without the multiple choice</paragraph>
    <paragraph>approach the essay as you would the critical reasoning questions  particularly the so called weaken questions  there s a stimulus a passage that arrives at a conclusion  usually a business plan  a policy prescription  a recommended course of action  there are also factual and axiomatic premises and a number of implicit assumptions  of which one is key  in the critical reasoning exercises  the weaken questions ask you to select the statement that does the most to undermine the key assumption  as we have pointed out before  answering the question requires you to follow a careful strategy  first  you identify the conclusion  then you identify the evidence on which it is based  then you tease out the key assumption that enabled the author to go from the reach the conclusion from the evidence </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the same strategy applies to the essay  you must be taking a critical  aggressive approach to the stimulus  as in the weaken questions  first identify the conclusion  you don t necessarily have to disagree with it  but you do have to take issue with how it was reached   the essay must show why the conclusion isn t warranted by the evidence  was the sample partial or inadequate  was the author s use of the evidence inappropriate  does the logic of the argument permit us to infer the conclusion  what logical fallacies has the author perpetrated  after you have taken the author s argument apart  you should suggest what kind of evidence might have helped to strengthen his argument </paragraph>
    <paragraph>classic fallacies</paragraph>
    <paragraph>become familiar with classic fallacies  we spend much of our time putting forward arguments and criticizing the ones put forward by others  therefore  it s important to know the most frequently deployed fallacious arguments  the passage stimulus could be based on one or more of them  there is no shortage of fallacies  here is a very partial list  using unrepresentative or insufficient samples  false analogies  confusing causation with correlation  confusing cause with effect  ascribing a single cause to an event that had many causes  cherry picking the evidence  post hoc ergo propter hoc  because one event preceded another  the earlier event must have caused the later event   false dichotomies  appeal to ignorance  a claim is true if it has not been proven to be false   appeal to authority or to a majority  affirming the consequent  denying the antecedent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>keep an eye on the clock</paragraph>
    <paragraph>keep your eye on the clock  as soon as    minutes are up  the screen will disappear  you don t want to be in the middle of a sentence when that happens  organize your time with a view to getting everything done within    minutes  that means you must stop writing once    minutes are up because you must leave yourself at least five minutes at the end for proofing  the test center provides you with a rudimentary word processing program that allows you to type  delete  cut  paste and nothing else  there is no spell check  no grammar check  no matter how good a writer you think you are or how good a typist you think you are  you will make mistakes  particularly as you are writing under a time constraint  therefore  it is imperative that you leave yourself time to clean up your essay to get rid of typos  misspellings  repetitions  dangling participles  incorrect punctuation and missing words  it is stupid to lose points over silly errors  you should also use this time to make the essay tighter and more cogent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t get carried away by the rhetorical power of your own arguments  it is good of course to offer as many criticisms of the author s argument as possible  however  the more you pile on  the less time you are leaving for proofing  if you have come up with two reasons for calling into question the essay stimulus s claim  don t reach for a third if it means that you won t be able to finish the essay  two reasons and a completed essay is better than three reasons and an incomplete essay </paragraph>
    <paragraph>keep the structure simple</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the structure of the essay should be as straightforward as possible  it should start with a paragraph outlining your basic objection to the way the author has reached his or her conclusion  there is no need to go into details in the opening paragraph  it should serve as a brief summary of what you intend to argue  it s bad form in general to step on the points you will make later  you want to keep the reader reading  so hold stuff back  moreover  as likely as not  your main point may not be entirely clear to you when you start writing  the more you write the clearer will your argument become to you  therefore  leave your opening paragraph as a draft and come back to it at the end to ensure that it conveys the main point you want to make </paragraph>
    <paragraph>start by jotting down all of the ways the author s argument fails to convince  then select the two or three strongest reasons for doubting the logic of his argument  your second paragraph should focus on the most important reason why the author s argument is inadequate  your third paragraph should focus on the second reason  your fourth paragraph on the third  make sure you mention what evidence you would like to see adduced in order to make the argument more compelling  that could be your fifth paragraph  the last paragraph should be reserved for the conclusion  this is usually a restatement of the opening paragraph  that s why it s good at the end to go back to the beginning and redraft the opening sentences </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t forget  it s only    minutes  a good essay will put you into the right frame of mind for the rest of the test </paragraph>

  <title>business schools accept greater percentages of applicants from non traditional backgrounds  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>business school are increasingly accepting more applicants with backgrounds in fields other than consulting  marketing and business  according to results from a recent survey by kaplan test prep  kaplan surveyed business school admissions directors from     business schools and found that    percent said they accepted more students from stem  science  technology  engineering and math  backgrounds for the         cycle than they did three years ago </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business school demographics are shifting  with growth coming from applicants who are younger  more international and have stem backgrounds   lee weiss  kaplan executive director of pre business and pre graduate programs  said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>weiss also contributed the shifting demographics to growth in specialized master s degree programs   a specialized master s degree can be a great fit if an applicant knows they want to pursue a career in that particular field  while a traditional mba provides broader options   weiss added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the kaplan survey also found that    percent of business schools polled reported accepting more students who applied directly from college than three years ago  it also showed that only    percent of business school admissions officers cited lack of relevant work experience as the biggest  application killer   compared with    percent who said low test scores  on the gmat or gre entrance exam  could cause an applicant to be rejected </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  even many of the most selective business schools claim that no single component of the application will determine a candidate s fate   rather that they view the entire process holistically  and kaplan  which helps prospective applicants prepare for both the gmat and gre entrance tests  has reason to spotlight results suggesting that test scores hold greater sway than other elements  still  the growing diversity of applicant industry background is interesting to note </paragraph>

  <title>leading business schools increase focus on social entrepreneurship</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>social entrepreneurship is becoming a more prevalent facet within the graduate management curriculum at several leading business schools  driven in great part by growing student demand  according to a recent new york times article   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are putting down the tracks as the train is coming   pamela hartigan  director of the skoll center for social entrepreneurship at oxford university s said business school  told the times regarding that school s social entrepreneurship offerings  hartigan estimates that about half of the students at said are interested in issues of long term social and ethical sustainability  although experts say that students interested in social business still make up only a minority of mba applicants  according to the times report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a study by the sustainable business networking group net impact last year found that    percent of respondents would consider working in social enterprise and that    percent were considering jobs in the nonprofit sector  though the times noted that the figures may have been influenced by lower than usual hiring in more traditional post mba sectors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an economist article earlier this month expressed greater skepticism regarding reports of a trend toward social entrepreneurship within leading mba programs  suggesting that it s largely pr hype   business schools claim their graduates are less concerned than they once were about earning fabulous salaries   read the economist report   instead of trumpeting the number of students who get high paying jobs in finance  they now reel off examples of those who join non profits or launch social enterprise  this fits the socially aware image they wish to portray after the financial crisis  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nevertheless  that business schools are focused on projecting a more socially aware image is in itself a shift  at the same time  business schools are increasingly recognizing and responding to the fact that social and business management needs are not actually at odds   running a good charity  that runs on sound financial principles  comes from learning some of the tools that business can provide   said s hartigan told the times  likewise  traditional business managers today need training in issues like corporate social responsibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph> so  as business bends to demands for better behavior and nonprofits bend to the need to be more businesslike  business schools are making a two way bet   concludes the times </paragraph>

  <title>career services directors at top business school report strong jobs market</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba graduates from some top schools are finding jobs in less time and at higher starting salaries than they have in years  according to a recent article in forbes  despite the undeniably adverse effect of the economic crisis on mba hiring  especially in the financial services  careers in consulting remain strong  and today s graduates are also finding growing numbers of opportunities in technology  e commerce  luxury retail and energy sectors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed     percent of companies reported as part of the gmac      corporate recruiters survey that they plan to hire recent mbas this year  up from    percent that hired in        not only that  those employers expect to hire an average of      new mba hires  up from      a year before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these rebounding figures have helped some schools achieve record setting placement levels  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school reports that      percent of its most recent class of graduates received job offers within three months of graduation  with median base salaries rising to          from          the year before  the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin also saw hiring pick up  with salaries up to boot   we saw a six year high for mba students employed three months after graduation  with    percent of our students with job offers   stacey rudnick  mccombs director of mba career management  told forbes  the average starting salary for mccombs graduates this year was           and    percent of grads received a signing bonus as well  worth an average         </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba hiring remains very strong in management consulting  corporate finance and marketing product management  but wall street and investment banking offer fewer jobs and are attracting fewer students  according to fred staudmyer  director of career management at the johnson school of cornell university   consulting is still a huge draw for mbas and there s still lots of work   he told forbes  meanwhile  mba students are also showing increasing interest in the technology sector and new digital media   and finding increasing numbers of jobs there   big tech is hiring more mbas each year in the internet retail  social media and business solutions spaces  and more of our mbas are interested in earlier stage companies now   staudmyer added </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school prepares to offer online courses</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  is at work on a new online learning initiative called hbx  though it is sharing few details about the effort so far  bloomberg businessweek and the chronicle of higher education report  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other top business schools like the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and stanford university s graduate school of business have been unveiling moocs  massive online open courses  over the past year  as has harvard university itself  so it s not surprising that hbs is developing online courses  too  although it hasn t decided yet whether those courses will be broadcast as moocs  according to the chronicle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brian c  kenny  hbs chief marketing and communications officer  told the chronicle that the school has not yet decided if it would use edx  the nonprofit organization harvard university founded last year with the massachusetts institute of technology  to deliver the online courses  but kenny told bloomberg bw that the courses would likely be offered through edx  starting in spring or summer      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to kenny  hbs is still working out how to deliver online its signature pedagogical technique  the case method  which is built on intensive interaction among students and faculty   whether or not the case method can work online is a question that we haven t answered yet   he told the chronicle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kenny declined to give any other specifics about hbx  including what courses are planned  any costs to students or how the school plans to make money  bloomberg bw turned to linkedin to try to learn more  surmising that the effort has been underway since at least june  when jana kierstead  executive director of the harvard mba program  was named to head the new initiative  according to her linkedin profile  in her profile  she describes hbx as  a new team dedicated to delivering high quality business education through innovative online products  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the chronicle  for its part  scoured job postings in an attempt to uncover more information  it found a july job posting for hbx that suggested that hbs does plan to make money from its online activities  the posting  which has since been removed  was for a sales and marketing expert who can  develop a deep understanding of the online learning market and collaborate with constituents across harvard business school to successfully market and sell hbx s product line   the chronicle reports </paragraph>

  <title>change is the only constant where mba programs are concerned</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in the united states today  nearly four times as many students earn an mba as earn a law degree  a ratio that was one to one a mere    years ago  even as american demand begins to level off  students in emerging markets  especially india and china  are flocking to the degree in growing numbers  but against this backdrop of swelling popularity  prospective mba applicants are taking a hard look at the potential return on investment as never before  as follow up to its rankings  released last week  the economist examined these and other important shifts in the mba landscape as part of an article published over the weekend </paragraph>
    <paragraph>data from the economist s most recent rankings show that the average basic salary for mba graduates has dropped        in the past five years  to          meanwhile  student surveys the economist conducted as part of its rankings reveal that students are more focused now on how much they stand to make post mba than they were before the economic crisis  moreover  as salaries have fallen  tuition has climbed  at the university of chicago booth school of business  ranked no    in the economist      rankings  tuition has gone up by         since       to           at harvard business school  hbs   it has increased by         in the same time period </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective mba applicants must now do a careful analysis before starting a program to make sure it is worth their time and money  but that s only one of the ways the mba has changed  the economist points out  another shift has been toward more specialized degrees and concentrations within the mba  with more and more programs now offering tracks tailored to specific industries  such as health care or luxury goods  or specific study areas  such as data analytics  this shift is driven by the steep competition students face to line up their post graduation career before day one of the mba  students are sometimes so focused on finding the right job that they can forget to savor the learning experience  chicago booth dean sunil kumar told the economist </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the biggest change the mba faces  according to the economist article  is the rise of educational technology  to mooc or not to mooc   that is  to offer some courses free of charge to students around the globe via online platforms   is a question business schools are grappling with  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school recently announced that it will offer its core mba courses via mooc  and hbs is also developing online courses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but beyond giving classes away for free  how and when business schools embrace distance learning as part of their for pay offerings will likely prove the hottest arena to watch  the economist suggests  the university of north carolina s kenan flagler business school blazed the trail  with the debut last fall of its mba unc program  an online mba program that can be completed in    months  unc currently enrolls approximately twice as many students in its online program as in its full time  on campus program   and it charges the online students more  the economist reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to douglas shackelford  who directs the mba unc program  online classroom technology has now reached a tipping point  where it is at least as good as a real classroom and in some respects even better  mba unc classes are capped at    students  all of whom can interact with each other from locations around the globe  professors  likewise  can lecture from india  france and across the united states  and those lectures are available      for students to watch as often as they like  at their own pace </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools  though  should take heed  the economist article suggests  because as mba students are given more choice as to how to obtain their degree  business schools may be forced to compete on price  many for the first time </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  reclaimed the top spot in the forbes      biennial ranking of mba programs  released today  the university of chicago booth school of business took second  bumping harvard business school  hbs   which topped the list in       to third place  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school followed up the lead in fourth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>forbes  which ranks full time mba programs every two years based on return on investment  found that at the top    programs in the united states  the degree still pays off  although it takes longer to do so  for the class of       the class surveyed for this year s ranking  the average payback period was     years  as compared to     years a decade ago  forbes reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gsb graduates tied for the highest average paycheck entering the mba program           the same as hbs and wharton   but their median compensation five years out from graduation            was greater than any of the other schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs dropped to third place this year because its five years out total compensation fell by    percent  from          two years ago to          according to this year s survey  as a result  the five year gain for hbs graduates this year was          down from          in      </paragraph>

  <title>upenn s wharton school sees uptick in round one applicant volume</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the university of pennsylvania s wharton school saw an increase this year in the number of applications submitted by its round one deadline last week  according to the deputy vice dean for admissions  financial aid and career management   if you believe that application volume is an indicator of the relevance of an mba program  then i am pleased to announce that our round one numbers are up   wrote deputy vice dean maryellen lamb in a post to the wharton mba admissions blog yesterday  she did not disclose how much round one application volume increased </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lamb s comment referred to a wall street journal article last week that questioned whether four years of declining application volume to the philadelphia school might be an indicator that it had fallen from its long held position as one of the most elite mba programs in the world  wharton s director of admissions ankur kumar also announced last week that she was leaving her position to pursue other opportunities effective october  th  lamb  who was promoted earlier this year from her position as director of mba career management to the role of deputy vice dean overseeing admissions  financial aid and career management  will lead the admissions department following kumar s departure </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond announcing the uptick in round one application volume  lamb devoted her post yesterday to providing an explanation of wharton s team based discussion  tbd   a new interview method the school launched last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our goal was to give our potential students an opportunity to show us who they are   how they think  lead  communicate and interact   she wrote   at the same time  we wanted our applicants to experience who we are   a highly collaborative culture that cultivates persuasive rather than positional leadership  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>acknowledging that many of last year s prospective applicants approached the new interview format with trepidation  lamb noted that the pilot went well and that many participants reported that they enjoyed it  she went on to outline the logistics of the newest component of wharton s application process for this year s applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lamb explained in her post that the team based discussion will be by invitation only  like wharton s one on one interview  and will be required to complete the admissions process  five to six applicants will take part in each tbd  with the composition of the groups determined by the timing of when individual applicants sign up   there will be no  crafting  done on our end   lamb noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants who are invited to take part in the tbd will receive a prompt for the discussion prior to the interview  lamb and her team recommend that applicants  with this prompt  devote about an hour of advance preparation for the exercise </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the admissions process will still include a short one on one  individual conversation with an admissions team member   lamb wrote  these short individual interviews will follow an applicant s tbd exercise </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in last year s pilot  wharton will conduct the majority of the tbd interviews on campus  with second year admissions fellows leading the exercises  although some tbds in each application round will also be conducted by admissions officers in select cities around the world   on  and off campus team based discussions will be conducted in the same way and considered equally   lamb noted   there is no  advantage  in choosing either option   she added </paragraph>

    <paragraph>stephen rakas  similar to how faculty are focused on delivering our business curriculum to students  my team and i are focused on teaching our students the skills needed to be successful networkers  job candidates and interviewees  our mission is to help our students develop a career focus in line with their personal mix of skills  values and interests  to guide them in developing the tools and resources they need to market themselves and to create a professional environment where students and recruiters can meet and interact to explore opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if we re doing it right  we re teaching our students a set of skills they will use throughout their working life to manage their careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  to do that effectively  i need to ensure i m managing our resources and team appropriately to enable us to set and achieve relevant goals  which include both student counseling coaching activities as well as employer relations management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as a smaller program  we have the opportunity at the tepper school to know our students as individuals and to partner closely with our recruiters to understand and support their goals as well  given that i came up through the ranks in career services  i enjoy keeping engaged with students  so i still keep a small counseling load  and i try to meet with as many others as my schedule permits </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  an important part of my job is to ensure we re partnering effectively with our colleagues across admissions  student services  corporate relations  alumni relations and other areas to maximize all of our efforts and resources </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  now  about your team  how many career advisors do you have  is this a relatively constant figure  if not  how has it changed in recent years  how might it change in the near future </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  we have a staff of     which includes eight counselors at the associate director or director levels  three staff who manage our recruiting efforts and two others in general office administration  as with most mba programs  we ve made a conscious effort to attract and recruit career counselors with relevant experience in the industries and functions most often pursued by our students  several of them are graduates of our mba program  and all of them perform both student counseling and employer relations duties  while many schools have separate teams focusing on these activities  we ve found the dual role keeps our team energized and their industry knowledge remains current through their frequent interactions with employers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our counselors work in teams based on their industry functional expertise  which are aligned with the careers most often pursued by our students  for example  students preparing for consulting opportunities have a different path than those preparing for financial services  so these teams work closely with our students and student clubs to offer relevant programming  our students are assigned to a particular counselor based on their declared interests  and after the initial required meetings are completed  the student can choose to continue to meet with their counselor exclusively  or to meet with any other counselor of their choice  this process has been very popular with our students  and the student ratings on our one to one advising sessions have been very strong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we were honored this past year to be ranked the    career services office in the bloomberg businessweek mba rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  can you provide prospective applicants with an overview of the recruitment process at tepper  when does it start  how does it unfold </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i tell our incoming students that the recruiting process for summer internships begins well before they arrive on campus for our base camp orientation program  which is a school wide effort taking up most of the month of august  we provide an online checklist of activities for them to complete over the summer  mainly related to self assessment and introducing resources to help them to learn more about careers of interest to them and how to interact with recruiters  they complete the paperwork related to assigning them to a relevant counselor  and they are asked to arrive at base camp with a working draft of their updated resume ready to share with their counselor  at base camp  our sessions provide an overview of the career services office and the on campus recruiting process  as well as entire days devoted to career  verticals   which consist of faculty and career center staff presentations  as well as alumni panels focused on consulting  finance  marketing  operations and entrepreneurship  which encompasses the career interests of almost all of our students  we re not necessarily requiring them to select a path from which there is no alternative  but we are letting them know that if they don t at least identify plans a and b  they are going to be at a disadvantage when talking with recruiters in a few short weeks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after base camp is over  classes begin at the end of august  the tepper school is well known for its analytical rigor and rapid pace  we operate on a mini semester system  so students are changing classes every six and one half weeks  with breaks between known as  experience weeks   these periods are used for clubs treks  supported by the coc   as well as sessions with our new accelerate leadership center  which provides programming and coaching to develop our students  leadership and communication skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph>employers host presentations and other events for all students beginning the first week of classes  but on campus recruiting in the fall is for second year students only  of course  many first year students will land internship offers in the fall  as a result of attending the various conferences and national career fairs offered during that period  during the fall  our first year students also have a series of required meetings with the coc  including resume and mock interview sessions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our first year students officially begin interviewing on campus in january for summer internships </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how has the economy impacted recruitment at tepper  how have you and your staff remained flexible or adapted in order to help students navigate a more challenging job market  have you encouraged flexibility on the part of students themselves </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  all business programs felt the impact of the downturn of       fortunately  at tepper we began to see a strong recruiting recovery within about    months  and the last three years have shown a steadily increasing employment rate  as well as rising salaries  many consider the consulting industry to be a bellwether  meaning it s often the first to contract hiring and the first to recover in a turbulent economy  consulting has emerged as our    industry in the last few years  followed by other high growth sectors like technology  bio pharma and manufacturing  financial services recruiting has remained more challenging  but this situation is by no means unique to the tepper school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in      and       when many long term recruiters were cutting back and entire companies were collapsing  we reacted by reaching out and heavily engaging our alumni  as a smaller program  our alumni have always been a critical component of our success  and many alumni came through with summer internships and full time job opportunities for our students  they helped to reinforce our messages of networking and leveraging the tight knit tepper alumni community  many of our alumni were amazingly generous with their time and support  even when they were not in a position to provide job opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i believe the  great recession  and the sluggish recovery that has followed has imprinted heavily on the generation of students currently attending mba programs  for many of them  it s the only economic environment they have known as working adults  this seems to have raised awareness of the importance of not relying too heavily on outside forces or counting on sheer luck to achieve your goals  when alumni speak about the importance of building and maintaining a network  and share their own experiences  this group appears to be listening and taking the advice to heart more than i ve seen in the past </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how does your team counsel students regarding the interview  is there a formal mock interview process  how are interview schedules administered  is there an established policy regarding how closed and open interviews should be conducted  what facilities are available for interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  at our base camp orientation program  our overarching message is that our students need to be  recruiter ready   which includes having well developed interviewing skills  our counselors bring a wealth of interviewing expertise from their past careers  and we also offer a series of workshops  co hosted by our student government and professional clubs  to focus on things like stars  case interviews and other topics  our professional clubs  including consulting  finance and others  offer specific technical content and training aimed at improving performance in industry specific interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>also  each student must successfully  pass  a videotaped mock interview with their counselor in order to retain access to recruiting  after on campus recruiting begins  students who are singled out by recruiters as poorly prepared in any way are required to meet with a counselor and work on improving any deficiencies  or face disciplinary action </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for on campus recruiting  we do not require a set percentage of  open  or  closed  schedules  nor do we currently offer bidding  when we had the technology available to offer bidding  we had so few employers interested that we discontinued it  most companies prefer closed schedules  and our recruiting staff does a tremendous job working with companies to condense schedules or make last minute additions to ensure schedules are filled with candidates the employer wants to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what kind of role do alumni play in tepper s recruiting process  how integral are they to your office s success  is alumni participation a major part of students  job searches </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  our alumni are a critical part of our success  i ve already described how the tepper alumni community came through during the downturn of a few years ago  in addition to that  we have many eager alumni advocates supporting recruiting  hosting treks  appearing on panels and many other things  i believe our smaller size works in our favor in this regard </paragraph>
    <paragraph>having been at tepper for    years  one of the most rewarding things for me  personally  is when former students are now our recruiters  alumni panelists or hosting groups of students on the same treks they helped to organize when they were students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  do you have any advice for prospective applicants in terms of what they might do in advance of the mba program to be better prepared for the job search process  in your experience  do you find that students who have done x  y or z before arriving on campus have a more successful experience with career services and the job search as a whole </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  whether incoming students are career changers or simply seeking to grow within their current industry function  it s critical to take a step back and think about their motivators for pursuing a graduate degree  for example  the specific things  whether it s traveling  writing detailed reports or reconciling financial statements  that you did not enjoy about your last job are probably not going to be any more enjoyable just because you can command a higher salary or title with an mba  the students are presented with a relatively rare opportunity to re direct their career toward things they actually enjoy doing  as long as they are also able to convince an employer to hire them to do those things </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i believe too many incoming students focus on employment statistics or starting salaries in a particular area  while ignoring the long term career implications  as stated earlier  an mba can provide the basis to completely redirect one s career  but it s only one part of the process  students who have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses  as well as an understanding of what ignites their passion  will find it much easier to weed through the options that are going to present themselves and sell themselves effectively in the marketplace </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students who also recognize that they will need to put in significant effort both inside and outside of the classroom to network within a new industry or function are usually the most successful career changers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the practical side  i recommend that incoming students begin to read the relevant business journals and reports and follow the business news media to develop a point of view on current business topics  if they are not already doing so   this activity will not only help you to acquire a business vocabulary but will also allow you to converse intelligently on topics that can impact interactions with recruiters or alumni  if you say that you are interested in trading stocks  for example  but can t succinctly describe your current market view when asked  it will be a short conversation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a final suggestion is that if you are considering a field where the gmat score is well known as a screening tool by recruiters  most often consulting   the time to consider re taking your gmat to boost your score is before you begin your studies </paragraph>

  <title>admissions director ankur kumar resigns from upenn s wharton school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the admissions director at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school will leave her post this friday  october  th  according to an email sent by wharton dean tom robertson to the school s faculty and staff this morning  the wall street journal also reported the news  noting that the school had declined its requests for comment but that according to several sources kumar informed her staff of her decision last week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a wharton alumna  kumar has been a member of the admissions team for the past four years  serving since      as director of admissions and financial aid  in his email announcing her departure  dean robertson praised kumar for helping the school reach unprecedented female enrollment  women now number more than     of the student body  as well as for introducing several innovations in admissions  including the  team based discussion   a group interview format launched last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite these innovations  wharton s application volume has dropped    percent over the last four years  according to a wsj article last week  kumar and school officials contend that the lower application figures  combined with a stronger applicant pool and a higher percentage of accepted applicants who enroll  prove that her team has done a better job of targeting candidates  dissenters  including the wsj  argue that the drop off signals wharton s slip from its long held position as one of the top three mba programs in the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maryellen lamb  wharton s deputy vice dean of mba admissions  financial aid and career management  will guide the admissions team upon kumar s departure  according to dean robertson s email to faculty  lamb  who previously served as director of the school s career services department  was promoted to deputy vice dean last month </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wsj noted that wharton has had three admissions directors since       when rose martinelli left to head up admissions at the university of chicago booth school of business </paragraph>

  <title>wharton needs to better showcase what s right with wharton</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>swirling debate picked up this week in the realm of top mba programs  fueled by a wall street journal article on friday entitled   what s wrong with wharton   the journal piece hinged on a notable    percent drop in applications to the university of pennsylvania s wharton school over the past four years  against a backdrop of gains in application volume by several other top schools in the same time period  wharton s drop did seem to beg the question of what s wrong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the journal article suggests that behind the falling application volume is the fact that wharton   with its indisputable strength in finance   didn t shift quickly enough or significantly enough in the wake of the financial crisis to attract students more drawn to post mba careers in fields like technology and entrepreneurship  the journal also called attention to wharton s slide in several top mba rankings  the philadelphia school has for the past several years consistently finished behind the university of chicago booth school of business  harvard business school and stanford graduate school of business rather than holding steady as one of the top three business schools in the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton dean of admissions and financial aid ankur kumar contends that the decline in application volume  combined with a stronger applicant pool and a higher percentage of accepted applicants who enroll  proves that she and her team are doing a better job targeting candidates   our focus is on the quality of our applicant population  and that remains as high as ever   she told the journal  pointing out that the average gmat score for the class of      was a record setting      poetsandquants  which ran a lengthy rebuttal article to friday s journal piece  also noted that mba graduates from wharton this year had one of the best placement records in the school s history  with      percent of the class receiving job offers within three months of graduation and median base salaries rising to           up        from the year before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for its part  the poetsandquants piece suggests that wharton s stock is undervalued  yes  there has been a drop in application volume  and yes  wharton has slid in the rankings  but the school continues to deliver an incredible mba education and will remain on the short list of the very top management programs in the world   those negatives may well be a reason to apply to the school s prestigious mba program right now   writes p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a third perspective comes in the form of an article posted on linkedin over the weekend by wharton management professor adam grant  which documents many ways in which wharton has expanded in recent years beyond the constraints of its reputation as a finance school  with substantive initiatives and resources that are drawing a wider and wider array of students  grant points out that of the    percent of the most recent graduating class who accepted job offers within three months of graduation     percent went into consulting  compared with only    percent who went into investment banking  venture capital  private equity and technology have also been drawing a greater percentage of graduates  most notable  grant argues  has been a spike in entrepreneurship  in the last six years  the number of wharton students starting a business upon graduation has  jumped from     percent to     percent  which  incidentally  is greater than the   percent of hbs students who start a business upon graduating  for what it s worth  wharton last year had more than    graduates starting their own business  compared to stanford gsb s     grant adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perhaps what s wrong with wharton is that it just hasn t gotten the message out about what it s doing right  as grant s article points out  wharton is doing a lot of great things to add to a program that has long been one of the world s top choices for graduate management education  at the same time  the fact that application volume has dropped can t be disputed  giving credence to pandq s assertion that the school s stock is currently undervalued  with the arrival of a new dean in the fall  wharton faces an important opportunity to clarify for all stakeholders that its program hasn t actually faltered but instead has pivoted in directions that will only strengthen it in the future </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit chats with dean bob bruner of uva s darden school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>when bob bruner  dean of the darden graduate school of business administration at the university of virginia  casually mentioned getting together over a cup of tea in philadelphia last month  clear admit jumped at the chance  it s not every day that the dean of a top ranked mba program proposes meeting up   in our own city no less  it would turn out to be just a part of what makes bruner unlike some other deans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a member of the darden faculty since      and its dean since       bruner has long promoted darden s commitment to high engagement teaching and to fostering a collaborative community oriented ethic among its students  his efforts have won him multiple leading teaching awards at the university of virginia and within the commonwealth of virginia  as well as designation as       dean of the year  by forbes cnn money and poetsandquants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bruner has long set himself apart as a dean who blogs and tweets regularly  hoping to share his unique perspectives with a wider audience   there are few deans that blog about their own work or the world around them or higher education   he told us   i think that s a shame  i think deans have a lot to say that could inform the way all the stakeholders at business schools engage their schools and shape expectations about the schools  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for more on what bruner has to say   on topics ranging from gender equity and the mba to growth in massive open online courses  moocs  to the ways graduate management education must adapt to and embrace globalization   read on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  tell us about charlottesville  what are the advantages and disadvantages to having a business school there </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bob bruner  the straightforward answer is it is a tremendous town to live in for two years plus  many people come to darden  want to come to study with us and want to stay  so it is attracting its own entrepreneurial community  other darden alums study at darden  go away and work  and then they want to come back after five         years and set up businesses  so we have a thriving tech industry  private equity community  asset management community   and the university and the darden school are helping to be a nexus of those groups  we have an incubator  we have a very  very successful innovation and entrepreneurship institute  the batten institute  and we just started a center for asset management that attracts professional asset managers and the like  so it is a lovely town anointed by no less than usa today as the most desirable small town to live in </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i was cornered about a year and half ago by a broadcast journalist  i was literally in a corner  she thrust a microphone in my face  with a cameraman behind her  and said   you know  i live in manhattan  i could get an mba from a dozen schools there  and they are more convenient  i could stay in my own apartment  continue my own circle of friends  and i wouldn t have to work as hard because everyone knows how rigorous darden is  why  why oh why  would i leave manhattan to go all the way up to the foothills of the blue ridge mountains to attend darden  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i asked her   when you like to dine out  where do you like to eat   this was one of those eyes glaze over moments and i thought she was going to tell the cameraman to turn off the camera  but she took the bait  she said  well because i am constantly chasing news stories i eat where i can when i can  but what i really like are those intimate little restaurants where the ingredients are fresh that day  recipes are original  service is just so  presentation is excellent  the wine list is superb i walk out of those little hole in the wall restaurants with an absolutely new attitude about food   she went on at considerable length  i said that s what darden is like </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden is a destination school  it is not necessarily the easiest  most convenient or least expensive  but it is a school to which you would go if you really want to change your life in professional ways and  in fact  in even deeper ways  we specialize in helping students discover what they are strong at and helping them find their ways into those careers  many of our alums will describe darden as an absolutely transformative experience  it changed their lives   they thought they were going to pursue one career but instead took a    degree turn into something else  it s a very common testimonial i get </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the charlottesville community is kind of a metaphor for the experience within darden  so darden is relatively smaller than what people would regard as our peer schools   we have about     students per class in the full time program     in the executive mba  emba  and    in the global executive mba  gemba   we do a great deal in the way of collaborative work among students  because the class sizes are relatively smaller   literally  even the classrooms are smaller than many of our peer schools   and the student body is smaller  the students all get to know each other  there is a very collaborative community oriented ethic in our culture  we don t like to get ahead by scoring off of other people  climbing over the backs of others  it s much more   come on everybody  here s the way to solve this problem   and people chip in and say   and i can improve on that  and i can do this   and so on  it trains our students to be managers and leaders and to bring the best out of teams </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so i hear from the companies who recruit at darden that they especially value our students for their practicality  their grounded ness  their ability to hit the ground running  they don t take a year to burn in  to shed the lofty theoretically approaches that they may have learned  they play well in the sandbox  they contribute well to teams  they help lead teams and get the best out of team based work  they communicate well  if you participate in     case study discussions over the course of two years you are bound to be able to develop an ability to express ideas and recommendations  and we have a very strong emphasis on business ethics and the role of integrity in being able to lead well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how much of that emphasis is a response to the recent crisis and how much of that has been in place for some time   bb  we were one of the leaders in establishing a required graded course in business ethics  and that was back in the     s  we have an extremely strong business ethics faculty  regarded as among the world s leaders in this area  i think the crisis really brought out  certainly stimulated in my heart  a very deep reflection about the purpose of business schools and the impact on not only the lives of individuals   the students   but also the corporations and other organizations where we send our students  i know other deans i have spoken with have experienced the same reflective kind of process  it s pretty clear that the world wants different managers and leaders than what you see in  mad men    or some of the other very popular  power oriented shows  indeed  i don t think that works very well  we discovered that being able to lead a diverse team   not a team of five bob bruners  but a team differing by gender  race  national origin  sexual orientation  etc    is an unusual skill  and ordinarily it leads to better insights and outcomes than some kind of command and control approach </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  speaking of  mad men  and diversity  you saw the new york times piece on gender equity at harvard business school  what is it like to be a female student at darden </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i read that article with humility  and i think all deans in privacy of conversations among deans would acknowledge that there s a lot about student life that occurs outside of the radar screen of deans  in some ways  that s a reflection on the limited scope of rationality  our ability to absorb facts and details about student experience  it is also respectful in that many of our students are in their late   s and they have private lives   thank you very much dean  but don t go there  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i should acknowledge that i received my mba and doctorate from hbs  my mba was back in the   s  and i graduated from the doctoral program in       i didn t see that  gender class inequity  when i was there  the article is causing a fair amount of processing  i m trying to understand the gender aspects but also the socio economic aspects  it s the latter that stimulates a lot of my thinking this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but the gender issues are nontrivial  harvard is about three times darden s size and it s a comparison of apples and oranges  i leave it to you to infer or to talk to the people at harvard about their experiences  but we don t put up with the kind of steamrolling that the article implied   not only for women but for other groups   in the sense that class discussions are dominated by white males or people who have industry experience  etc  our faculty are really trained to bring out students from a variety of perspectives  honestly i think that leads to better discussions of case problems  more importantly i think it models the kind of leadership that we inspire our students to demonstrate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the reasons that i like to teach by the case method is that in a sense what we teach is how we teach  we are teaching the students to lead by questioning others  rather than command and control  telling one s employees to do it this way  not that way  instead we teach by reasoning with them and saying   how do you suppose a customer experiences the engagement with our business when you just set the tea down as compared to when you put down the cup and pour the tea and offer it up nicely   that questioning process is the characteristic of leaders at some wonderful firms  as an example  gortex comes to mind  the founder of the company was a revolutionary in his style of leadership of his management team and indeed of his employee base  he rarely gave commands or orders but instead quite typically would say   let s think this through   another example is johnsonville sausage in wisconsin </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think the notion is that we are trying to model a way of addressing business problems and doing it in a way that is collaborative and brings out the best of everybody in the workforce  maybe even in the customers  the suppliers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  you have been a tweeter and a blogger for quite some time  is that personality or strategy of a combination of both  are you an early adopter by nature </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i have been blogging since       i do it in large part because i want to bring a set of ideas and a perspective to an audience that i don t readily see in the world  now  every writer wants to believe that he or she has something absolutely different and special to say   so what i just said i say with a degree of humility  but there are few deans that blog about their own work or the world around them or higher education  i think that s a shame  i think deans have a lot to say that could inform the way all the stakeholders at business schools engage their schools and shape expectations about the schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we have about        alumni spread all over the world  and though we have numerous means of communicating with our alums  none of them are quite as spontaneous or personalized as the blogs and tweets  so i do it to reach the wider community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what event  change  or development at darden are you most excited about in the year ahead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  gosh  we have a passel of possibilities i could tell you about  i can tell you that right now we are in the midst of the delivery of two new moocs  massive open online courses   last spring we delivered three through coursera  and this fall we have two new ones  one is a course   introduction to strategy   by michael lennox  a senior member of our faculty  a real enterprising colleague  he taught a strategy course last spring and has carried it forward this year and added more bells and whistles  it is an example of a course that is taking the canon of ideas in strategy and digitizing it through the mooc  he has        registrants   i don t even need to ask mike lennox  but i am quite confident that right there are more students than he has ever taught face to face in his accumulated career to date  but let s also acknowledge that only a   th will actually complete the course  submit the coursework  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there s another course being taught by ed freeman   capitalism and society   freeman is a leading business ethicist  and i have had people reach out to me spontaneously to tell me how both courses are rocking their world  they are taking one or both  they are either alums or people in the business world  and they have to bubble about these courses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school is giving these courses for free  and the students evidently like it  students are spontaneously organizing study groups in places like pakistan  argentina  the uk  new york city   to get together at coffee shops and talk about the content of that week and what they have learned   let s compare  let s make sure we really understand what s going on  etc   so there is a social media element to these courses that is really powerful  we are going to do something with that idea   i am not going to elaborate   but the opportunity for a not for profit educational institution like ours to have that kind of impact in the lives of students around the world is huge  and i am eager for us to begin to harness that  the tech  the moocs  would be a big element of what we are doing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the second thing coming up this year   predating the new york times article last sunday   is that we have organized two tiger teams  tiger teams are what we call groups of people on our faculty and staff who organize around particular topical issues intensively to develop opportunities or problems and offer up recommendations  which we then incorporate into our curriculum or practices as a school  we have two tiger teams together calling themselves the  initiative on women  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first is working on adopting some best practices that will enhance the educational experience of women at the darden school  this does indeed look at patterns of participation and calling by professors and the like  but it goes well beyond it  because what our students experience at the darden school is an extraordinary blend of what happens in the classroom  as well as what takes place extracurricularly in clubs and social activities at the school  as well as ultra extracurricularly  in the social life well beyond the organizing limits of the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we for years have paid attention to student satisfaction surveys  and the satisfaction of white males has ordinarily exceed that of white women  underrepresented minorities  international students  i am pleased to say that in recent years the satisfaction levels of women and men have virtually converged because of our efforts through tiger teams like this </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think there is still more work to be done in the area of diversity  i am the eighth dean of darden  and i was the first to appoint a chief diversity officer  we have a very active diversity advisory group that comes in a couple times of year and talks to the whole leadership of the school about best practices in diversity and what we can do to raise our game </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the second tiger team in our initiative on women is for women alumni of the school who face a very different professional life of launching a career  maybe stopping out for children  maybe resuming back into business  the resumption of which is quite challenging  women who have stopped out a while face doubts  questions of self confidence and competence  if they don t go back into business they might start small firms or work for nonprofit organizations  do very intensive volunteer work and the like  all of these issues are related in part to work life balance  which have big implications for men  so we are also examining the experience of our male alums and filtering those insights back into our own curriculum  we would like to create experiences that sustain the professional lives of women alums of the darden school and ideally can tell men something new and then bring those insights back into our program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a third and final exciting element is our global outreach  we ordinarily deliver a dozen to    or    small global experiences for our mba students around the world  this involves taking them to lovely places like barcelona and elsewhere in western europe generally  for instance  as well as obvious places like china and india  as well as not so obvious places such as tunisia and south africa </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students today don t merely want to go and study in these distant places  increasingly they want to go work on business problems or opportunities to have social impact  these types of global experiences take quite a lot of effort to set up   i am cautiously optimistic that the range of global experiences we offer this year will be our best yet </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we are going to hold an economic forum   a one day conference in china  we will be taking a group of students to normandy  france  in may to walk through the normandy battlefields with some officers from the u s  marine corps to talk about the stressful leadership challenges the officers faced as part of the d day invasion  the officers of the u s  marines will take small groups of five to    students each on a strenuous walk around the battlefields and stop periodically and say   put yourself there in june       the wind is blowing at    knots an hour form the east  there s low cloud cover  you hear airplanes coming in  you are beginning to get shelled from this direction or that  it s been six hours since your men ate last  what will you do   through a repetitive discussion process throughout the day you have what amounts to a series of six to    mini case discussions  they put the students on the ground in a very authentic setting to reason through the leadership challenges that could meet any enterprise leader who has to worry about fulfilling the mission of the enterprise and yet leading and managing in ways that sustain the coherence of the team and the welfare of the group  all of those are examples of our work globally </paragraph>
    <paragraph>women  technology  and globalization will be three very important themes for us this coming year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what do you worry prospective applicants may not know about darden  what do you want to highlight   bb  because i have studied at many business schools and i have followed our peer schools very closely  i would say that the number one error of applicants is to assume that schools are substitutes for one another  that a learning experience at school a is like one at school b or school c  the mistake is to believe that all mba diplomas are equal   to shrug your shoulders and just take one or another  don t worry about it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>big  big mistake  i know enough schools well from the inside to be able to say that   even among the most elite schools   the experience differs tremendously based upon the differences in culture of the school and a host of other things  the infrastructure  the setting  the resources available  to fight this notion that schools are easy substitutes for one another  i encourage applicants to get on the ground and simply observe what the different schools are like  any school that you would intend to spend two years and a lot of money and a lot of hard work on really ought to be the focus of a great deal of investigation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a great learning experience can tee you up for extraordinary discovery and success  it might save you from years spent walking down the wrong path that you might later regret  it can frame participation in a wider community that could have lasting impact  so you need to figure out what feels right  and the only way to do that is to get on the ground and do the investigation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  do you find that your applicant pool is fairly self selecting  have the majority of applicants done a good job of identifying what makes darden darden </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i am reasonably confident that the applicant pool comes to darden knowing that darden is darden  i say that because we are pretty transparent about what it is that makes darden different from virtually all of our peer schools  our admissions receptions are quite different experiences  the presence we create in the digital sphere is quite different  we have youtube episodes that demonstrate a case study discussion  people can check out some of our best teachers by looking at moocs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how much attention do you personally pay to the admissions process  admissions trends </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i am pretty involved in that i engage with the admissions director pretty frequently  participate very actively in the admissions events that we hold and engage with prospective applicants  but the conditional clause is that no dean can possibly hope to see the entire range of the applicant pool  we have between eight and nine applicants for every seat in our class  it is tempting for any dean to look over the shoulder of the admissions director and say   do this  not that   i think that s a formula for great error  if a dean needs to intervene to that extent i m not sure why the dean would need an assistant dean of admissions  the other thing is that i spend so much time in other directions as well  engaging with corporate sponsors  faculty  our parent university  that were i to devote too much time to the admissions process i would be neglecting some other important responsibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  does darden place particular focus on the partners its students may bring with them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  we have a big focus on partners  and it is quite consistent with our ethic of close collaboration and strong community  we have a very strong darden partners association  and we actively work to assist partners in employment  it is more challenging to find employment  particularly if you have a very high level of expertise  with central virginia being  well  smaller  this needs to be part of the application calculus for any prospective applicant  if you have a partner  it is important from the get go to think about what the partner s experience will be over those two years  and if the partner needs employment  that should be on the radar from the very start  but our darden partners association works very hard to boost and sustain and support partners </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for students who are part of a family  not just a pair   so where there are children present   charlottesville is really an outstanding place  because of the strong influence of the university of virginia there is a deep sense of a community of trust  it is a safe community  it is beautiful  you don t spend hours getting from point a to point b  but there are also real stores with lots of interesting goods in them  all the requisite services  we are close to richmond  va  about an hour away  which is a city of about half a million people  and then washington  dc  is two hours away  some partnerships divide their time and live in the middle between washington  dc  and charlottesville  so it s not impossible by any means </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  some schools are trending away from essays as part of the application process or are looking for ways of getting a more candid  unedited view of students a part of the admissions process  where does darden fall in that   bb  we now rely on one essay  we are still looking for a demonstration of an applicant s written communication skill because we still think that s important  even though in the digital age with tweets of     characters what passes for written communication can be pretty  shall we say  casual </paragraph>
    <paragraph>interviews matter a whole lot to us  for many reasons  not least of which is that from our international students we are looking for a clear demonstration of mastery of english and indeed americanized english  our case discussions go rapidly   the international students who thrive at darden are those fluent enough to catch humor  irony and emotion and to be able to respond fluidly to the give and take of the discussion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>letters of recommendation still matter to us  the quality of the letter and the familiarity of the writer with the applicant are highly influential  too many letters of recommendation are shallow   i am the ceo of the corporation  johnny or susie has been employed with us for four years   and then just banalities   he or she showed up at      a m  isn t that nice   that s not good enough  applicants should look for recommenders who will say something authentic and substantive  the best observations are based on personal direct familiarity rather than second  or third hand reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what haven t we touched on that you want to share with clear admit s readers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i would offer a few comments about our executive format programs  we have an executive mba  emba  and a global executive mba  gemba   they are both hybrid programs in that a material percentage      to    percent   of the program is online  either synchronous or asynchronous  and the balance is in person  our emba is seven years old and our gemba is going on three years old  our emba was just ranked   th   by us news  i think </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these programs are aimed at people who want to remain in the workforce not just because they want to get a steady paycheck but typically because they are in positions of such responsibility that they want to keep contributing to their organization and retain the career momentum that they have with that organization </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what we hear is that the hybrid structure works extremely well  which is a big learning for us because we are known for case method teaching  for our strong faculty  for face to face engagement  for strong community  and it may not seem obvious at first that we can obtain those same outcomes in the hybrid structure as we do in the full time program  but we do  so i am seeing student evaluation averages that equal or exceed what we see in the full time program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the emba has one international residency   all the rest of the residencies are in charlottesville  the gemba has an outstanding difference in that the face to face experiences are conducted in six residencies  they start in charlottesville and washington in one two week experience  students then take classes online  then we bring them together again  say to china  then more online  then to brazil  india  europe  france usually  and then we bring them back to the u s  it is a full time program     months  the global program is especially aimed at executives who have awakened to the fact that their futures hinge tremendously on cross borders activity  we are delighted with the response  both the rankings and the student evaluations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i would conclude by reemphasizing that what makes darden different in all three programs   full time  emba and gemba   is the way we teach  which is heavily and highly engaging  this isn t passive learning by any stretch  this is rolling up your sleeves and sorting out the problems and puzzling your way through to a set of recommendations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second  it s the faculty  our faculty are experts in a wide variety of fields  and they care immensely about excellent teaching </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the third is community   the bonding that takes place  and that s because we are in charlottesville  we are a smaller program  and we intentionally aim to produce a culture of collaboration and mutual learning  i think these are huge distinctions in the field of mba education </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i have deep respect for all of our peer schools  and i don t mean to imply that what they offer is less worthy  but what the world is telling us is   both in terms of the sheer volume of applicants and the quality of the applicant pool  as well as the companies who come to recruit at the school   is that they like what they see and they want to work with us </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  so being in charlottesville hasn t presented a challenge in terms of recruiting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  last year we had about     companies visiting our grounds  given the size of our student body  that is a lot  plus we are very active in helping students engage in off grounds recruiting through digital media   skype and other platforms   as well as with treks  we organize large group travel experiences to silicon valley  new york city  china  india  europe </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think something we are good at is helping students prepare for the recruiting experience  when i was an mba student   which is a long time ago   the recruiting experience was mainly one of  figure it out for yourself  send off a lot of letters to see if you can get on a list to interview   today we train students very actively in shaping their own career development exploration  search process  recruitment process  we have a very active career development center that invites students in  works with them  coaches them through the entire year  and this has led to a high placement rates in the past few years  i am proud to say </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i am a faculty member   i don t want to believe that the only reason students come to business school is to get a job  i believe they come to business school to get an education  which leads to a job  but we are a professional school  and part of preparing mbas for the profession they are entering is to help them understand that over the course of their entire career they may have a dozen different employers  the process we take them through is one grand rehearsal for what they may experience again and again throughout their careers </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley haas school of business to offer new and retooled online classes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>following its pilot last year of a range of new online courses for its mba students  the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley is expanding its online offerings while also reworking some of the initial courses based on feedback from students and professors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the three pilots offered online last year was  power and politics   a popular mba course taught by professor cameron anderson  this year  the course will be offered again  but with a revamped website and platform designed to be more intuitive to use  faster download times are also expected to improve the student experience  allowing for conversation that  mimics the in person experience as much as possible  with back and forth and even spontaneous interjections   anderson said as part of an article on the haas website  he noted that he got to hear from many more people as part of the online version of the class  through online class discussions and chats </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students in the  power and politics  pilot  too  praised the advantages the new course delivery method presented   with the web based format  we had forums that allowed much deeper discussions than in class conversations  and we had games and simulation tools that illustrated  power and politics  concepts in a more interactive fashion   said philip tam  mba     who took the course last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the new online course offerings this year will be a hybridized version of  social media marketing   taught by assistant professor zsolt katona  in two sections of the course this fall  katona will use web based technology to deliver one third of the course material  teaching the balance in the classroom  by videotaping and editing some of his lectures  katona notes that he can produce better quality material  which students can access with greater flexibility   students can stop it anytime  ask questions and discuss it among themselves   he says  adding that ensuing online discussions will allow him to hear opinions from everyone in class and incorporate them back into group discussion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to adam berman  executive director of online initiatives at haas  online learning opportunities will continue to expand  to this end  the school plans to hire a new digital program manager  in addition  abby scott  who formerly held leadership roles in mba career management and executive education  has been appointed associate director of online initiatives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>berman  for his part  is happy to see an online transformation gain footing   just as we ve seen technology and globalization transform other sectors over the last two decades  these same forces are now in the early stages of transforming higher education   he said   education is one of the last areas of life to synch with our  digital native  population of students who already live their lives through technology  </paragraph>

  <title>applicant volume for full time mba programs on the rise</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a majority of u s  business schools reported year over year growth in full time mba applicant volume for the first time since       according to new data from the graduate management admissions council  gmac   for the class that started this year  the median number of applications for full time  two year mba programs rose by nearly    percent worldwide  gmac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac  which administers the gmat entrance exam  surveyed     graduate programs at     schools worldwide for its latest application trends survey  the results of which were released yesterday  application volume increased at    percent of two year programs responding to the survey  up from    percent a year ago  interest in one year mba programs also climbed  with    percent of programs surveyed reporting a rise in applicant volume this year over last  as compared to    percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in      and       early in the great recession  there was impressive growth in the proportion of full time mba programs showing application increases   lawrence rudner  gmac vice president for research and development  said in a statement   in      and       there was a subsequent decline  but full time programs began to rebound in      and look even sturdier today  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>u s  schools  for their part  reported a median   percent gain in applications to full time  two year programs  growth in international applicants accounted for much of the application gains at u s  schools  gmac reports  noting that    percent of the programs had more international applicants this year than last  helping to compensate for the fact that    percent reported fewer domestic applicants year over year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several top u s  business schools were among those reporting jumps in application volume this year  including columbia business school  cbs   where applications rose by     percent  according to the wall street journal  last year  in contrast  applications to cbs s full time mba program dropped a staggering    percent   we are optimistic about where our application trends are going   cbs spokesman evan nowell told the journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one year mba programs in the united states also saw significant gains  according to the gmac survey  among one year programs responding to the survey     percent reported application volume increases this year over last  applications to the one year program at cornell university s johnson school of management  for example  jumped by a third  to      the journal reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>part time mba programs   at least those in the united states   didn t fare as well in the past year  among u s  part time programs  only    percent reported increased or steady application volume in       last year     percent of u s  part time programs reported increases  european part time programs had a stronger year  with    percent reporting increasing or stable application volumes compared to      </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school admissions continues transparency trend with note to round   applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>applicants who submitted an application earlier this week as part of harvard business school  hbs  s round   received a prompt confirmation email direct from dee leopold  hbs director of admissions and financial aid  in it  leopold continued hbs s increasing trend toward transparency in the admissions process by spelling out in clear  down to earth terms just want applicants should expect from this point forward </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a senior team will begin reviewing submitted applications within a day or so of the september   th round   deadline  leopold wrote  and this team will make decisions about who moves forward and who doesn t </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  moving forward  means being invited to interview   leopold explained  adding that she expects interview invitations to be issued in early october and interviews to be conducted from mid october through november    not moving forward  means that we are unable to admit you   leopold continued   we want you to be able to move ahead with other plans so we will send these decisions out in october  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a third group of round   applicants may be asked to remain under consideration  for review again with round   applicants   we call that  further consideration  and the details will be communicated to this group in mid october   leopold wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold asked round   applicants to refrain from submitting any additional materials at this point  except for those students who need to send official gmat or gre score reports   if we re missing something  which is unlikely  we ll contact you via email   leopold said  she added that her team will begin reviewing applications with self reported test scores while awaiting official scores from the gmat or gre </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold s note  as well as its tone  represent a shift in recent years by hbs toward providing greater transparency and insight into the admissions process for applicants  a departure for a school that had a history of being much more opaque  now  the boston school is setting itself apart from several of its peers by sharing an increasing level of detail with applicants throughout the process </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school tackles entrenched issues of gender inequity</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  dean nitin nohria has  for the past two years  been leading a school wide effort to foster greater success among female mba students by making changes to the school s curriculum  rules and social rituals  according to a recent front page story in the new york times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs for years has seen women enter the school with the same test scores and grades as their male counterparts  only to quickly fall behind  the school has also struggled to attract and retain female professors  so in       the times reports  harvard  first female president  drew gilpin faust  appointed dean nohria  who pledged to address the gender relations issue head on  two years in  the school reports remarkable gains among women  though some of the changes implemented by the administration have met with opposition and hostility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the effort to remake gender relations at hbs  nohria and his team stationed stenographers in classrooms to prevent biased grading  gave untenured female professors private coaching  launched mandatory discussions about sexual harassment and complemented the time honored case study method with a new course  field  which groups students into problem solving teams </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after two years of these and other changes  the grades of female students rose significantly  and the teaching scores of female professors also shot up  according to the times report   by graduation  the school had become a markedly better place for female students  according to interviews with more than    professors  administrators and students  who cited more women participating in class  record numbers of women winning academic awards and a much improved environment   read the times article  indeed  for the first time in the school s history  almost    percent of the george f  baker scholars   a venerated honor awarded to the top   percent of the class   were women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nonetheless  some hbs students characterized the efforts of nohria and his administration as anywhere from off putting to  a painful experience   the times reported  and the project has revealed numerous entrenched issues to which solutions remain elusive  including the degree to which female students often feel they have to choose between academic and social success and the ways in which wealth  or the lack thereof  influences the experience of hbs students of both genders </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we made progress on the first level things  but what it s permitting us to do is see  holy cow  how deep seated the rest of this is   frances frei  hbs administrator and chairwoman of the first year curriculum  told the times  the deans have vowed to carry on the experiment  though they would not say how aggressively  nohria  for his part  told the times that he has been guided throughout by the phrase   sunshine is the best disinfectant  </paragraph>

  <title>former ross adcom member and newest clear admit admissions counselor shares his view on mba admissions</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this month clear admit welcomed a new member to its team of admissions counselors  jon fuller spent four years as senior associate director of admissions at the ross school of business at the university of michigan  fuller s experience in a top program s admissions office gave him many opportunities to assess candidates and determine their fit with ross  clear admit s blog readers are certain to enjoy the interview we recently conducted with jon  which you can find below </paragraph>
    <paragraph>could you describe what goes on behind the scenes during the ross application review process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there will be a number of changes to the review process in            given that ross is more fully rolling out the group exercise component of the evaluation process   before i left ross  we had a lot of conversations about how the timing would work out and how the new component would impact how applications are reviewed  but there was still much to be decided about how the steps would all come together   regardless  much of what i ll describe is still accurate and you can review soojin s blog for updates about the process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after the application deadline  all application information is downloaded into the university s database  and a large volume of information is loaded into a spreadsheet   just about everything but the narrative responses like essays and recommendation letters   it s an excel junkie s dream        every candidate has a row on the spreadsheet  and the document has grown to have well over     columns of information   the information ranges from fundamental things like your name  but also lists recent companies and titles  length of post grad work experience  undergraduate graduate programs  majors  and gpas   every detail about your standardized test performance  demographic information  citizenship and resident status  career interests  evaluation status  contact information  dual degree status   the list goes on   from that  we constructed tons of pivot tables to quickly and easily monitor the review process  get applicant pool profile information  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this spreadsheet is also utilized at the beginning of the assessment process to help sort the candidates into three main categories  i definitely want to know more  so let s interview  i m not sure if i want to interview  so let s take closer look to determine  and i really don t think this person is competitive and will likely be denied   the first two categories tended to be the substantial part of the applicant pool with the last category being very small   it d take me a number of days to review all of the candidates  classify them  and then have the results vetted by the director </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all of the candidates are getting additional evaluations of their application materials with a team of experienced outside readers and or associate directors   essays  recommendations  etc   even those of the least competitive candidates  receive a thorough review regardless  our associate dean and director thought that was very important to do this to help avoid missing folks who  at a high level  might not look as competitive as others </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first two categories of candidates have every word of the application read and summarized by the outside readers   the associate directors then review those summaries  with a particular emphasis on spending more time with the resume and recommendations   if someone hasn t been invited to interview yet  the outside reader summaries are leveraged to help make the determination whether or not to interview   once a completed interview report comes in from the alumni or student interviewer  the associate directors integrate the interview comments with the rest of the application materials   they then make a recommendation to admit  waitlist  or deny </paragraph>
    <paragraph>historically  ross has invited candidates to interview in two main waves   the first wave consists of the  let s interview  candidates from the initial review of the spreadsheet   the second wave consists of those who were flagged for an interview as a result of the detailed review by the outside reader team and the associate directors   the two waves tended to be fairly balanced in size  but this year there will likely be one large wave  followed by a small clean up later in the round   the large wave will likely come a little bit later in the round than in previous years since the invitees will come from the initial spreadsheet review and the outside reader associate director review   the reason for the change is to help ensure that as many of the interview invitees as possible have the opportunity to attend a group exercise event </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once all of these individual recommendations were completed by the associate directors  i would review all of the decisions in their totality and make adjustments to ensure that the class was shaping up to have our desired overall profile   i would then forward them to the director  where she would take that refinement to another level  and then finally  she would forward on our decisions to the dean s office for final approval </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what was the most common pitfall or mistake you saw applicants make over the four years you were on the admissions team at ross  what advice would you give in regards to that pitfall or mistake </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most classic mistake would be candidates  who on a high level review  appeared to be very competitive and a good potential fit for the school  but when you started to look deeper  they hadn t done their due diligence in researching the program and hadn t customized their application materials to the school   that lack of research most frequently appeared in the  why ross  related essays and or in the interview   it s a competitive application process  and if you can t show fit to a program or show that you re passionate about the school  even the strongest candidate is going to have trouble being admitted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what part of the job did you enjoy the most   while i supervised ross  overall recruitment and admissions process  i was also in charge of our diversity initiatives   i really enjoyed getting to know management leadership for tomorrow fellows and consortium for graduate study in management candidates   it was very rewarding to help those candidates put their best foot forward in the application process through our on campus events and in participating with those organizations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what part did you dread   the waitlist process over the summer   i was in charge of reviewing our waitlist pool  deciding who to offer admission to  etc   it was especially tough since you re trying to gear up for the next admissions cycle while  at the same time  finishing up the current cycle   for those that you admit in the summer  on the one hand  you re giving them exactly what they wanted   admission to your program   but on the other hand  you re probably turning someone s life upside down </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while i didn t know it at the time  a few years ago one of my waitlisted candidates had essentially given up hope of being admitted  so he decided to move to hawaii  not a bad place to work on reapplying    when i called him with the offer  he had just moved there  found an apartment  etc   he had to think about it for a minute  but he decided to enroll and had to shift gears again to move back to the mainland   fortunately  i got a hold of him a few hours before he purchased a car       that happened to another waitlisted candidate   i called this other candidate as he was literally driving a new mercedes off of the dealer s lot   he tried to return it  but the dealer wouldn t do allow it   he had a pretty nice car relative to his classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>do you feel that there have been any major changes to the mba admissions landscape over your years at ross  changes for the better  changes for the worse   a big change has been the increase in one year program options and the decrease in overall mba applications to many us programs   many might read about lower numbers of candidates applying to top programs and may think that it s easier to get in as a result   however  the quality of the candidate pool hasn t really decreased  and in many ways  admission to top programs has become more and more competitive given how strong the pool is   i was always amazed about what our applicants had accomplished and what they wanted to do with their mba experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is your perspective on application timing  r  vs  r  vs  r   in general and in terms of ross specifically   in general and for ross  round   and round   should always be the first priority   while there are always people who will be admitted in round    things get much  much more competitive in the last round   for most programs  there usually isn t too much of a difference between the selectivity of round   and     to help determine which round is better for you  the simple answer is that you should apply when you feel that your application and your profile are at their strongest   rushing to get an application submitted by a round   deadline just to be in for round   is a poor decision </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you were the point person for applicants from the consortium for graduate study in management  what would you say the benefits of applying via the consortium are   if you are a us citizen or permanent resident who has experience supporting the mission of the consortium  you really shouldn t think twice about applying through their process   there are many benefits to applying through the consortium  most notably the common application  which can save you some significant time and money in applying to up to six of the consortium s member schools   if you re approved for membership to the consortium and end up enrolling at one of the consortium mba programs  you also have the opportunity to attend their annual orientation program  op   which is a massive career development program and fair that occurs before you enroll in your mba program   many people actually secure summer internship offers through op   before they ve actually started classes at their program   the other significant benefit is consideration for a consortium fellowship  which is a full tuition scholarship awarded by the consortium program that you ve been admitted to </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what do you consider the most important element of a compelling mba goals essay </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the important ingredients to this kind of essay are clarity of thought around your short  and long term goals  why it makes sense to pursue an mba at this point in your career in order to achieve those goals  and how the specific school in question will help make your goals a reality   my experience has been that candidates often miss the mark with the last element   they don t effectively show that they ve done their research on the program to show how it s a great fit for them  and as a result  the adcom may get the impression that they re just another program that the candidate is applying to rather than the candidate s top choice   given how competitive the process is  schools are more inclined to admit a candidate who conveys authentic enthusiasm about their program and its differentiating factors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is your overall philosophy for admissions consulting  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is no such thing as a perfect applicant  but my goal is to develop an application strategy with you that will identify and maximize your strengths and make them stand out to the programs to which you re applying  all the while mitigating the weaknesses that inevitably exist </paragraph>

  <title>growing number of doctors pursue health focused mba degree at fuqua school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the number of doctors applying to the mba health sector management program at duke university s fuqua school of business is on the rise  in part a reaction to the passage of the affordable care act  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an average of    doctors has applied to the school s fulltime healthcare focused mba program each year between      and       up from    per year  on average  in the six years before that  the number of doctors applying to the executive mba program has also increased  to an average of    per year between      and       compared to    per year between      and       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the number of doctors applying to fuqua has increased  so too has the number of those admitted  since       an average of seven and    doctors have been admitted to the daytime and executive mba programs  respectively  the school reports  that s up from an average of five and    doctors  respectively  admitted to the two programs over the six years previous </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fuqua professor david ridley  who directs the health sector management program  cites several reasons that doctors can be more motivated to pursue an mba when the healthcare sector undergoes changes  as with implementation of the affordable care act  often they are looking to understand what the changes may mean for the practice of medicine  specifically  doctors come hoping to learn how to lead organizational change within an established organization or how to create their own entrepreneurial organization in response  he notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in other cases  doctors are spurred by changes in healthcare to pursue an mba because they want to remain in the sector but to stop practicing medicine  ridley notes  at the same time  students not previously in healthcare can be motivated to pursue a healthcare specific mba program because they want to be a part of big changes within the industry as they take place </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business education enables healthcare students to develop as leaders and entrepreneurs   ridley said in a statement   at the same time  healthcare students make the business school better by their concern for people and understanding of policy  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fuqua first introduced its health sector management program into the mba curriculum in       a record    first year students have enrolled as part of the daytime program s current incoming class  the school reports </paragraph>

  <title>admissions tip  using rankings to your advantage</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>there are numerous sources that can knowledgeably rank the  top  mba programs   however  because business schools receive different rankings depending on the sources  criteria  it can be difficult to understand which are the  best  schools   therefore today we d like to talk about how b school applicants can use rankings to discover the  best  schools for them   although the general merits of each school are important  we also believe that it is important for mba applicants to rank schools based on their individual needs and interests   therefore we encourage students to use official mba school rankings in the following ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   use rankings to create a consensus   sources rarely have the exact same rankings as each other  and therefore trying to determine the  top five  schools can be frustrating   however  it s best to compile these different sources of rankings to form a consensus regarding the top schools   for example  if your target program is consistently listed in the top     regardless of its individual ranking among different sources  you should feel confident that it is regarded as a top school by industry professionals and future employers   you may not be able to pinpoint the ultimate  number one  school  but you will be able to distinguish between the different tiers of schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   consider individual rankings   mba applicants should assess schools based on how they will help them gain what they want from their business school experiences   therefore we urge you to ask yourself what matters most to you in an mba program   some applicants may value strict adherence to the case method more than the amount or size of research centers  whereas other applicants may want a large number of diverse student organizations or a strong joint degree program   looking at the individual criteria from which rankings are calculated may help you judge business schools based on the specific factors that matter most to you   for example  if you are interested in entrepreneurship  then perhaps you should consider applying to an mba program with a strong program in this field  even if it receives lower scores in other areas especially if these areas are not a main concern for you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>    think about where you want to go after business school   in addition to considering what you want to get out of your business school experience  you should think about how business school will help you pursue your future career   therefore  some important rankings to consider may be the number of internships students gain at a particular mba program or how many recruiters from different fields visit specific campuses   these rankings may be especially important if you need to follow a specific career path to achieve your career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to studying rankings  we encourage b school applicants to do further research in understanding the comparable merits of business schools  such as perusing admissions information  talking to professors and students  and visiting campuses   furthermore  we encourage applicants to check out our clear admit school guides  which offer detailed profiles of the leading mba programs   best of luck to those researching business schools </paragraph>

    <paragraph>samberg  who is the manager of hawkes financial services llc and a member of acadia woods partners llc  and gabelli  who is chairman and chief executive officer of gamco investors inc   both credit their success to the education they received at cbs  through their gifts they hope to support the completion of the school s new facilities and  in so doing  expand the opportunities available to future students </paragraph>

    <paragraph>gabelli noted that his own parents didn t have a formal education and that it was his great education that allowed him to succeed   in order to provide that type of education  schools need great facilities   he said in a statement   columbia business school is at a critical point in moving to manhattanville  and i figured i d help as much as i could to push it over the goal line  </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg school of management adds video essay  alters admissions deadlines</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this week  the kellogg school of management said that it will begin requiring a video essay as part of its           mba application  the school will also revert to a one part application  with a single set of deadlines  rather than the two part process it has used in recent years  these and other changes were first reported monday by poetsandquants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the new video essay  students will be directed from the application to a landing page on a skype like platform where they will be asked a short question  according to a subsequent report in bloomberg businessweek  applicants will have one to two minutes to collect their thoughts and one to two minutes to record an answer  they can replay their answer and start over up to two times is they are dissatisfied  receiving a new question on each subsequent try  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we felt like this was a great opportunity to meet our applicants from wherever they might be in the world   kate smith  kellogg s assistant dean of admissions and financial aid  told p q   we felt that we were past the tipping point in terms of video technology and comfort with it   most applicants would have used skype or facetime   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new video essay will not replace the traditional interview as part of the kellogg application process  many of these interviews are conducted by second year students and alumni  and the video essay will give the admissions committee a chance to meet the candidate in a video format  smith said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg also has reverted to a one part application with a single set of deadlines  a simplification of the more complicated two part application it has employed in recent years  the posted deadlines are october   th for round    january  th for round   and april  nd for round    applicants can schedule an interview only once they have submitted their application  and submitting earlier can help applicants match for an interview faster  the school says  kellogg will use the same application and procedure for its part time and executive mba programs as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  in keeping with the trend among top business schools  kellogg has also this year reduced the number of written essays it requires  from four to three  and cut the total word count applicants will have to answer the questions  from      to      </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business webinar offers tips for applicants to new ms computer science mba joint degree</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  announced this past spring that it will offer a new ms computer science  mscs  mba joint degree program  and a recent webinar provides tips for prospective applicants looking to learn more about the program and its application requirements </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the webinar begins with mary oleksy  who oversees the joint and dual degree programs for the gsb  outlining some basics   the purpose of this degree program is going to be to provide an opportunity for computer scientists to develop necessary skills to be managers and entrepreneurs  and for technologically inclined business students to gain a solid background in computer science by combining these two degrees into a really focused and intentional approach   she says  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students in the three year  full time program will start with a year of core curriculum coursework at the gsb  followed by two years filled with a combination of mba electives and mscs required courses and electives  in total  the program consists of     units     from the gsb and    from computer science </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are some admissions requirements specific to the joint degree program  which were also covered in the recent webinar  for one  the gre is required of all applicants to the joint mba mscs program  unlike applicants to the gsb alone  who can submit either gmat or gre scores   no prior work experience is required   applicants may apply and attend straight from college  olesky notes that stanford has set no specific class size for the new degree program   we are really looking for quality more than quantity   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the questions asked most often by participants in the webinar pertained to whether or not applicants must have a background in computer science  in response  jay subramanian  the director of graduate admissions at the computer science department  recommended that prospective applicants take the foundational courses for the department  listed on the first page of this pdf  at a nearby educational institution or online   these could help you in preparing to apply to the mscs program  particularly those who do not have a cs background or do not have strong analytical and quantitative skills  and are coming from more of the humanities and sciences background   subramanian says </paragraph>

  <title>tuition climbs at um s ross school of business  remains flat in uc system</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last month  the board of regents at the university of michigan approved a        increase per term for its full time mba program at the ross school of business  the tuition increase  which will take effect in the fall  represents a     percent rise for in state students and a   percent rise for out of state students  meanwhile  the board of regents for the university of california system earlier this week approved a proposal that rules out tuition hikes for that system s graduate business schools  at least for this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as reported by bloomberg businessweek on june   st  two members of the six person board at the university of michigan voted against the tuition hike   the continued raising of tuition is not sustainable   regent denise ilitch said in a statement   if we were as good at raising revenue streams as we are at raising tuition  our students would be far better off  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with the tuition increases  the total coast of the program for in state residents will now be almost           the cost of ross s executive mba program will also increase by         to          for residents and          for nonresidents  an increase of     percent and     percent  respectively  bloomberg bw reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in california  meanwhile  students at uc berkeley s haas school of business dodged a proposed     percent tuition hike  at least for another year  bloomberg bw reported earlier this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in november  outgoing uc president mark yudof proposed increases to the supplemental fees students pay in    graduate professional degree programs  including business programs  the proposed increase for mba students at haas was        on supplemental tuition of          california governor jerry brown called on yudof to revisit the proposed increases  calling them unseemly amid recent sales and income tax increases in the state </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the revised proposal  which was approved july   th  tuition hikes were limited to four new professional programs and four underfunded nursing programs  business school programs will be unaffected  bloomberg bw reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>uc spokesperson dianne klein called it a balancing act  telling bloomberg bw that going forward the other graduate programs will need additional revenue to maintain quality   you want to have a top notch program in order to attract the best graduate students  but you also don t want to price yourself out of the market  or alienate the people who make decisions about state funding for the university of california   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to klein  yudof concluded that most of the programs can get by for one year at existing fee levels  but that it is not a long term sustainable proposition </paragraph>

  <title>ucla anderson school of management to become financially self supporting</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning with the         academic year  the ucla anderson school of management will no longer rely on state funding but will instead be completely self supporting  the school reported last week  university of california president mark yudof approved the school s proposed status change for its full time mba program on june   th  ending a three year review process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the decision is expected to make it easier for the school to fund raise with its alumni and philanthropic donors  to make tuition fees more predictable and to give the school greater flexibility in faculty assignments  according to ucla anderson dean judy olian  who has led the campaign to win self supporting status for the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> ucla anderson is well positioned for the future  and this change further enables us to address mba student and program needs   she said in a statement   we also believe that our alumni and friends will be energized by the clarity of the school s financial model  and its singular dependence on self generated funding and philanthropy  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> people are confused about what state support might be   olian told the financial times  noting that net state support covers only   percent of current tuition fees  she believes that knowing that there is no state funding at all will help  alumni and philanthropic donors to step up to the plate   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yudof approved the change in status because he believes the school will have  the same academic requirements  the same faculty  the same curricula  the same kinds of students  the same admissions requirements and the same academic delivery model   he wrote in a letter to ucla chancellor gene block  he did place a few conditions on his decision  including that student financial aid will continue to be available to students who need it at a level commensurate with other uc full time state supported mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more than    million in state support previously allocated to the program will now transfer to the university at large   in every other respect  ucla anderson remains a part of ucla exactly as before   olian said in a statement   we see this change benefiting both the university and ucla anderson  a creative strategy in response to declining funding from the state  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>oyler  who worked in admissions for dartmouth s tuck school of business and as a recruiter for mckinsey before joining clear admit  encouraged prospective applicants not to let a school s rank in the various mba rankings overshadow other important considerations  a top ranked school can help catch recruiters  eyes  but the school also needs to be the best match for what you want to do  oyler told bloomberg bw   it s two years and a significant financial investment   she said   so take the time to think about fit just as much as rank and reputation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ankur kumar  director of mba admissions and financial aid at the university of pennsylvania  also contributed to the bloomberg bw article  she stressed to prospective applicants that the choice of where to go to business school is a personal one that requires self reflection regarding what you want to get out a program  where you want to live for two years  how your academic and professional goals align with the school and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kumar pointed out that a school s admissions process can actually provide valuable indicators for candidates trying to determine fit  a given school s culture and values will often be reflected in the focus of its essay questions or in a unique component included in the admissions process  she told bloomberg bw  as an example  kumar noted that wharton recently added a team interview component to its application to assess how well suited candidates are to group projects  that s because wharton students take part in    to    team projects  on average during their mba program  she said </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley haas partners with mit sloan on energy efficiency research project</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>researchers at the haas school of management at the university of california at berkeley are teaming up with researchers at the mit sloan school of management to take a closer look at energy efficiency policies and regulations around the globe to determine whether they are realizing their full potential  the schools announced this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the project  called e e  is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the two schools designed to find the best way to go from using a large amount of energy   e   to a small of amount of energy   e    participating experts will include engineers  economists and others  and the initiative is led by catherine wolfram  associate professor and co director of the energy institute at haas  michael greenstone  a professor of environmental economics at mit  and christopher knittel  co director of the mit center for energy and environmental policy research  ceepr  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the collaboration is designed to measure the actual energy efficiency of given policies and regulation by leveraging cutting edge scientific and economic insights  the researchers say   the e e project is focused on singling out the best products and approaches by using real experiments centered on real buying habits  it will provide valuable guidance to government and industry leaders  as well as consumers   haas s wolfram said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mckinsey curve   a cost curve that shows that abating emissions actually pays for itself   serves as one of the group s motivations for studying energy efficiency   our goal is to better understand what the costs and benefits of energy efficient investments are where the low hanging fruit is  as well as how high that fruit is up the tree   mit s knittel said in a statement   the mckinsey curve would suggest the fruit s already on the ground  if this is true  we want to figure out why no one is picking it up  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some of the other issues the project will evaluate are whether consumers and businesses are bypassing profitable opportunities to reduce their energy consumption and how best to encourage individuals and businesses to invest in energy efficiency  already  the team is tracking consumers  vehicle purchasing decisions to discover whether better information about cars  fuel economy leads to the purchase of more fuel efficient vehicles </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the e e project features an advisory board made up of several prominent figures focused on energy  including former u s  secretary of state george p  shultz  who leads the energy policy task force at stanford university s hoover institution  mit institute professor john deutch  former undersecretary of the department of energy  and cass sunstein  a professor at harvard law school and president obama s former director of regulatory affairs</paragraph>
    <paragraph> i like the saying  a penny saved is a penny earned   which rings true from the standpoint of energy   shultz said in a statement   energy that is used efficiently not only reduces costs  but is also the cleanest energy around  the e e project will allow us to better understand which energy efficiency programs save the most pennies  </paragraph>

  <title>dartmouth s tuck school of business confers first mba mph joint degrees</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>two members of the graduating class of      at dartmouth college s tuck school of business earned not only an mba while there but also a master s degree in public health  mph   kate head and catherine augustyn were the first recipients of the new joint degree  which tuck now offers in partnership with the dartmouth institute for health policy and clinical practice  tdi   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new program is designed for students who want to combine tuck s comprehensive mba program with tdi s deep dive into health policy and clinical practice issues   the combination of those two programs we thought would be a really terrific marriage   paul b  gardent  an adjunct professor of business administration at tuck and director of the joint degree program  said as part of an article published in tuck s online newsroom  the joint degree program is an outgrowth of the health care initiative  an effort launched in      to expand healthcare focused courses and career resources at tuck  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>head and augustyn were drawn to the mba mph joint degree because it offered them an opportunity to develop and implement the tools of management education to address the challenges and complexity of healthcare  now  they will both apply the skills they have gained in leadership positions in this highly specialized field  head joins the chartis group  a consulting firm serving medical centers  and augustyn will go to work as a project manager under the chief financial officer at massachusetts eye and ear  an affiliate hospital of harvard medical school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the joint degree program integrates tdi s one year     credit  full time mph degree program into tuck s two year mba program  completing three years of education in two years  time is challenging but manageable  according to the first two joint degree graduates   you lose some of the travel opportunities in the mba to do the mph coursework  and you sacrifice a little relaxation time in your second year  but i think it s worth it   head said in tuck article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gardent sang the praises of the program s inaugural students   if our first two graduates are any indication  our mba mph joint degree students are going to really enrich both the tuck and tdi student bodies  and we know these graduates will play a leadership role in improving health care   he said </paragraph>

    <paragraph>cbs features a program that alumni can apply to in each of the five years following graduation  priority is given to applicants earning         or less  and benefits range from        to         depending on the amount of outstanding loans a student has  at fuqua  meanwhile  a loan assistance program extends benefits of up to        a year to graduates for up to eight years following graduation  and at wharton  a program will award up to         a year for five years after graduation  although actual amounts depend on available funding </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s graham richmond weighs in on harvard business school application changes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the business education media has been abuzz following the announcement yesterday that harvard business school  hbs  will change its application requirements in the year ahead  bloomberg businessweek  poetsandquants  the financial times and others all featured articles conveying the news and reactions to it  both bloomberg bw and p q consulted clear admit co founder graham richmond to get his take on what the changes mean  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most notable  richmond says  is hbs s decision to make the essay an optional portion of the application  which sets it apart from virtually every other top mba program   i cannot think of any that have zero required essays   he told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  hbs dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold did share yesterday that hbs may admit candidates who do not submit an essay  because they feel the rest of the file speaks for itself   richmond doesn t think very many candidates will fall into that category though </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my suspicion is that the vast majority of qualified hbs applicants will feel that they have more to offer than transcripts  data forms  test scores and recommendation letters and will therefore make use of the optional essay to further describe their personal background  leadership profile  professional aspirations and desire to join contribute to the hbs community   he told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the fact that there is no word limit on responses to the new essay question means that applicants can use the space to convey whatever message they think may not otherwise be represented in their application  richmond told p q   that said  given that hbs is describing the evolution of their essays as one that streamlines the overall application by reducing word count  and avoiding an essay writing contest   one could reasonably interpret the school as looking for something less than last year s     total word count   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for hbs s other changes to the application process   reducing the number of required recommendations from three to two and moving the application deadline up by    days or so   these are not as significant  richmond says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>requiring just two recommendations simply puts hbs in line with the vast majority of other leading mba programs  making it easier for applicants who are considering other programs to also apply to hbs  as always  hbs requires that the recommendations come from current or former direct supervisors or from someone the applicant worked closely with at an extracurricular organization  the goal  richmond told bloomberg bw  should be to select recommenders who  are in a position to judge the candidate s managerial skills  leadership qualities  emotional intelligence and intellectual firepower  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>likewise  moving the deadline up from september   th to september   th isn t a major change in richmond s view   this generation of applicants  the  millennials   has been anxious to start the process earlier and earlier each year   and we see that first hand at clear admit  where we have had a high volume of inquiries in months  like march  april and may  that used to be fairly quiet historically   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bottom line  richmond believes that essays can add value to a candidate s profile and that using hbs s  optional  essay will give applicants a way to differentiate themselves   not every applicant who will excel in business school is going to ace the interview process or have the absolute best letters or recommendation  gpa or gmat score   but many applicants have incredible experiences to share that don t fit into the confines of the application forms and really lend themselves to the prose format of an essay   he says </paragraph>

  <title>yale som admissions director updates clear admit on video interviews  other application elements</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the yale school of management  som  will formally incorporate a brief video interview as part of its application process in upcoming admission seasons  assistant dean and director of mba admissions bruce delmonico shared with the clear admit team recently  he also provided more detail about the tests yale som has been using to assess the emotional intelligence of its applicants and shared that his team will eliminate the english language test requirement that has until now been required of some applicants  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some round   applicants to yale som in the most recent application season reported that they were asked to respond to an interview question via video  in an effort to learn more about this development  we reached out to delmonico directly  who shared the following details with us  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale som piloted the video question format two years ago  in       and then put it on hold last year  re introducing it as part of round   this year  he said  the school plans to incorporate video questions fully into the application process going forward  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the motivation behind them is that the ability to think and speak in the moment is an important skill but one that is measured inconsistently in the current application process  so we are looking for a mechanism that will help us evaluate these qualities more consistently and effectively   he told us   we believe that video questions are a step in this direction  but by no means the end point  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>delmonico also elaborated on the mayer salovey caruso emotional intelligence test  msceit   which yale som asked applicants to take on a voluntary basis as part of the most recent application season  according to an article last month in the wall street journal  unrelated to the video questions  the     item msceit is one of a range of non cognitive assessments his team has been evaluating  delmonico told us   we ve been looking at a number of different assessments over the last   to   years and feel as though we re starting to get a feel for what may be worth folding into the process   he said  but so far  no such test has affected admissions decisions </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one other thing you may be interested to know is that we will eliminate the english language test requirement  toefl  ielts  pte  etc   this upcoming application season   he shared  until now  yale som has required this test for applicants whose undergraduate degree was from a program not taught in english  but future applicants will not face that requirement  delmonico said </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school reduces number of application essays  recommendations</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>prospective applicants to harvard business school  hbs   take note  dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold shared a lot of interesting information in her director s blog today  topline news  applicants for fall      will only answer one essay  with no word limit  and will only need to submit two letters of recommendation  down from three  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the single essay question asks simply what else the ad com should consider about an applicant s candidacy in addition to the other elements submitted as part of the application  resume  school transcripts  extra curricular activities  awards  post mba career goals  test scores   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that s it  no word limit  use your own judgment as to how much to tell us   wrote leopold   we have neither a  right answer  nor a  correct length  in mind   she added  noting that her team will review all elements of the written application before inviting some candidates to advance to the interview stage </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some applicants may even choose not to submit an essay if they feel the other elements of the application tell their story completely  leopold offered  repeating something she said last year when hbs first reduced its number of essays  leopold explained that hbs has further reduced the number of essays because applying to business school is  not an essay writing contest    there is always  and will always be   great variance in both subject matter and degree of polish in the essays of admitted candidates   she wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to the rationale behind requiring fewer letters of recommendation  leopold said she hopes it will remove a hurdle for prospective applicants  who come from organizations where there is not a tried and true path for talented folks to leave for business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking into her crystal ball  leopold predicted that roughly       candidates will advance to the interview stage of the selection process  on par with the last several years  her team will admit roughly       of those who interview  to result in a final class of     or so matriculating students  and the post interview reflection   an invitation to applicants to send a brief follow up email within    hours of interviewing   will be part of the application process again this year   we liked it   leopold shared </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so there you have it </paragraph>

  <title>umichigan s ross school of business revises essay portion of application</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a post yesterday to the ross admissions blog  director of admissions soojin kwon shared the school s planned changes to the essay portion of the application and the rationale behind them  applicants for fall      will find that one of the essays from last year has been adjusted  one has been eliminated and the others have remained the same  they will also find that they have     words fewer overall with which to answer the essays </paragraph>
    <paragraph> before we jump into the next admissions cycle  our team takes some time to reflect on how our application process worked for the past year and where we can make improvements   kwon wrote  noting that the process includes gathering feedback from application readers  student and alumni interviewers and even admitted students who decide to enroll elsewhere  kwon s team also confers with colleagues in career services  academic services and the mba program itself to make sure the application is designed to best identify potential star students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>revisions to the essay questions mean that ross will no longer ask prospective applicants to share what they are most passionate about   we enjoyed reading those essays  but unfortunately the responses just didn t help us to differentiate candidates very well   kwon explained </paragraph>
    <paragraph>two questions from last year remain the same  one that asks applicants to describe themselves to their future ross classmates and another that asks them to share a time in their career when they were frustrated or disappointed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perhaps the biggest change is a new three part question in which applicants will have     words each to answer why business school  why ross and what career they plan to pursue after business school and why   essay   is thematically similar to last year s essay  but we broke it up into three parts with the hope that it ll help applicants be more focused in their responses   kwon noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  applicants will still have an optional essay where they can discuss anything they haven t shared elsewhere in the application  but in lieu of     words  they will now be limited to     words for this purpose </paragraph>
    <paragraph> overall  our total maximum word count has been reduced by     words  and hopefully you ll be able to use that found time to craft the most compelling essays possible   kwon concluded </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in shortening the essay portion of the application  ross joins a growing list of top schools that have revised their applications to include fewer essays overall and limit responses to fewer words  others include mit sloan school of management  harvard business school  stanford graduate school of business  uc berkeley s haas school and spain s iese  just to name a few </paragraph>

  <title>new online magazine focuses on the mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>if you ve been scanning apple s newsstand recently  a new title may have caught your eye  mba intelligence is an online magazine for current and prospective mba students that debuted in december       currently available on the ipad  the new publication has been attracting most of its readers from the united states  the united kingdom  china and other parts of asia  according to publisher redwood apps </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the magazine features a mix of content  ranging from pieces geared toward prospective applicants on topics like preparing for the gmat to articles written by current mba students showcasing the analysis they have performed around current companies and issues as part of their work in actual business school classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>obviously  the student authored pieces can also serve as a resource for prospective mba applicants seeking a preview of the kind of projects they may become involved in once they enter an mba program  and for current mbas  the opportunity to publish work that prospective employers could read makes the online magazine especially appealing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since the debut issue late last year  mba intelligence has published monthly  with each new issue tackling a different theme  may s issue was a gmat special edition  with articles from gmat test prep firms manhattan elite prep and kaplan test prep filled with tips and techniques for prospective mba applicants on how to ace the all important business school entrance exam </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other articles in the may issue were written by current students from cass business school in london  in one  a group of executive mba students set out to define a strategy for market share growth for online grocer ocado  putting into practice precisely the skills and expertise they are developing as part of their strategy course at cass  a second article  written by a full time      mba candidate at cass  takes a deep dive into luxury brand marketing strategies  providing a thoughtful analysis of aston martin  the luxury car brand  which is now celebrating its centennial year  topics here include aston martin s successes and challenges as they relate to connecting with the customer  brand building  delivering value and creating long term growth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re wondering whether the new publication is worth its       online newsstand price  you can decide for yourself by perusing mba intelligence s debut issue  available for free here  as you ll see in the december issue  cass mbas figured prominently again  as they did in the most recent may      issue  here  student articles touched on topics ranging from the importance of business strategy during market entry and early growth to an analysis of how luxury brand jimmy choo has taken an integrated marketing approach   relying on social media  celebrity endorsements and product placement  along with more traditional print and in store marketing   to maximize brand recognition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  we found the publication interesting and well crafted  for prospective applicants  we think it s worth a gander both for the content specifically linked to the application process as well as for the preview the magazine provides of exactly the kind of work students can expect to encounter once they enroll in an mba program </paragraph>

    <paragraph>yossi feinberg  a stanford economics professor and the stanford ignite faculty professor  told the ft that the program is designed for professionals in their fields who lack managerial experience   it s remarkable how much innovation there is and how much is lost through the lack of business skills   he said </paragraph>

    <paragraph>in the midst of leading one of the top mba programs in the world  dean peter blair henry of new york university  nyu  stern school of business somehow also finds time both to publish and to unwind with students </paragraph>

  <title>interest in social entrepreneurship rises among mbas  creating some challenges for business schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as interest in social entrepreneurship has swelled among mba students in recent years  top business schools have responded by developing new programs  centers and scholarships for students pursuing a field that was relatively unheard of a few decades ago  but as the financial times reported in a recent article  the trend toward social entrepreneurship  as well as shifts in the structure of organizations social entrepreneurs seek to join upon graduation  presents a new set of challenges for top mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in the     s there was almost no talk at all in business schools about anything that we might now call social entrepreneurship   peter tufano  dean of said business school at the university of oxford  told the ft   i think we ve seen an explosive growth in demand for social entrepreneurship in the last    years   he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in response  said opened the skoll centre for social entrepreneurship       which recently hosted it   th world forum on social entrepreneurship  said students who demonstrate exceptional social entrepreneurial ability can apply for skoll scholarships as part of a program created in       and interest in these scholarships has tripled since that time  according to skoll centre director pamela hartigan  last year      students of said s cohort of     applied for the scholarships  and early indications suggest this year will be as high if not higher  even as criteria for gaining the scholarships has become more stringent   we have moved from candidates who had experience in development organizations to looking at those who have undertaken social entrepreneurial venture creation in a serious way   hartigan told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the stanford graduate school of business has likewise seen interest in social entrepreneurship balloon  according to the ft report  in          mba students graduated with a certificate in public management and social innovation  an add on to the mba   up from    in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at said  stanford and elsewhere  graduates focused on social entrepreneurship are moving away from nonprofit organizations and looking more to join for profit organizations committed to delivering social good </paragraph>
    <paragraph> more and more of our students are interested in setting up for profit rather than non profit social enterprises  this is definitely a trend   bernadette clavier  stanford gsb director of public management and social innovation programs  told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the converging trends of more students pursuing social entrepreneurship and more of those students leaning toward for profit organizations within which to work has created some new challenges for business schools  the ft reports  in the united states  for example  many schools offer scholarships or loan forgiveness programs to students who enter non profit organizations  but that assistance is not available to graduates who enter for profit organizations focused on social impact  despite the low salaries they will most likely receive </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are looking to find ways to extend our loan forgiveness and fellowship programs to social enterprises   clavier told the ft   the challenge is to identify a proper source of funding to support students who choose this for profit route   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools who encourage their students to pursue social entrepreneurship also stand to suffer in the annual rankings of mba programs that so many watch so closely   i do think that a business school that encourages social entrepreneurs is quite brave because mba ranking tables do take into account the salaries of mba graduates and typical salaries in social entrepreneurship tend to be lower   tim jones  an associate fellow at said and a newly appointed entrepreneur in residence at judge business school at the university of cambridge  told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph> rankings tables are the bane of my existence   concurred said s hartigan   how do we shift that idea about the importance of a high salary  if we re really going to sustain ourselves in the next millennium we need sustainable models  schools that emphasize social entrepreneurship should not be penalized   she added </paragraph>

  <title>northwestern s kellogg school of management sees application volume rebound</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>after a   percent drop in applications to its two year  full time mba program last year  northwestern s kellogg school of management saw double digit application volume increases this year to all of its mba programs  according to a recent article in poets quants  interest in the school s one year mba program for undergraduate business majors was especially great  with    percent more applicants this year over last  kellogg dean sally blount told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>blount bragged about the school s waitlist  calling it  awfully beautiful  and noting that it is filled with candidates with gmat scores of     and higher  she credited the school s new senior leadership team   as well as its strategy to build enrollment in its one year program while shrinking its traditional two year program   for the application volume growth  kellogg last year increased the size of its one year program by    percent  to     students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since joining kellogg from new york university three years ago  blount has been leading an effort to rebalance the school s degree portfolio   it is not about growth  it is how do we meet the need for the marketplace for the best students in the world  it s all about building the best class of graduates   she told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business degrees make up    percent of all undergraduate degrees granted in the united states in the past    years  and people in their   s feel like they have less time  blount told p q  these factors taken together underscored the potential appeal of the one year program   we are the only top tier school that has been in that market with this program   blount said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to increasing its one year enrollment and shrinking its two year program  kellogg has also launched an accelerated part time program at its downtown chicago building for students with undergraduate business degrees  and in august it will pilot a new one year ms in management studies for northwestern undergraduates without a business background   it s the equivalent of an undergraduate business and the first year of the mba degree   blount told p q  adding that the inaugural class will have    students  eventually  blount hopes to enroll between     and     students in the new program each year  although she did not disclose when the program will expand to include students from outside northwestern </paragraph>

  <title>tepper school of business flexmba online offering draws interest from prospective applicants nationwide</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>carnegie mellon university  cmu  s tepper school of business will debut a new online mba offering next fall  and prospective applicants from across the united states   as well as europe and asia   have shown interest and or submitted applications  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>flexmba   a new online mba offering that will offer the same curriculum  faculty and access to services to online students that they would receive on campus as part of the traditional mba program   differs from the mooc  massive open online courses  model by creating small class sections of roughly    students and maximizing interaction between students and faculty  tepper notes  students will take part in weekly live online classes with tepper professors and attend approximately five  access weekends  each year in which all flexmba students will travel to a cmu campus for intense classwork and professional development programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the appeal of flexmba is that now professionals in any geographic region can pursue a top level mba education without relocating  which may otherwise be prohibited by their current job or family situation   kelly r  wilson  tepper executive director of admissions  said in a statement  wilson noted that tepper so far has received applications or expressions of interest from prospective students in    states as well as europe and asia  the inaugural program will feature a synchronous online class component based on u s  time zones and will meet at locations in north america  reducing somewhat the feasibility of participation by students outside the u s   though any student who can meet the application requirements  access the online coursework  and travel to the periodic class meetings is eligible  wilson added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to online coursework and weekly interactions with professors  flexmba students also will have access to alumni and student services  including coaches from the school s accelerate leadership center and advisors from the career opportunity center </paragraph>
    <paragraph> face time and personalization are critical components of business education   robert monroe  associate teaching professor and director of the flexmba program  said in a statement   we will utilize technology to deliver appropriate components of the curriculum and will engage our access weekends to spur group learning and interaction   he continued  far from being just another mooc offering  flexmba is designed to deliver the same high level student experience as tepper s traditional full time mba  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tepper will host two upcoming online information sessions and application workshops  one on wednesday  may  th  from   to   p m   and another on wednesday  may   th  from    to   p m  these sessions are open to the public </paragraph>
    <paragraph>application requirements for the tepper flexmba are identical to those for the full and part time mba program  applications for flexmba will be accepted through june  rd </paragraph>

  <title>     wharton business plan competition winners announced  previous participants and competition organizers share their thoughts on the competition s value to wharton students and future entrepreneurs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the inspirations and motivations of those pursuing places in top mba programs are many  for some  the goal is to further careers in existing business institutions by gaining additional knowledge and skills that will propel their professional paths to the highest echelons of management  for others  the main goal is to develop the insights and relationships necessary to create their own ventures  and to foster the growth and success of said ventures once they have completed their mba studies  there are many other circumstances that might spark the passion for a b school education  but this afternoon and evening the latter entrepreneurial mindset was on full display during the final wharton business plan competition  wbpc  event </paragraph>
    <paragraph>held in the auditorium of jon m  huntsman hall  the day began with the eight finalists providing ten minute presentations followed by ten minutes of questions and answers with a panel of expert judges  this group included david a  cohen  ceo and co founder of karlin asset management  inc   maxine gowen  president and ceo of trevena inc   richard perlman  founder and executive chairman of examworks group inc   and rich riley  former executive vice president  americas  of yahoo  inc  among the  great eight  were wharton mba and emba students  as well as members of upenn s larger student population  including one freshman  two seniors  and multiple penn medical school students  business ideas ranged from online solutions to buying childcare products in southeast asia to a new  non invasive method of treating rheumatoid arthritis  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to get to venture finals and present their respective business plans in front of the judges  panel  the teams went through four competition stages  while similar business plan competitions are held over the course of just a few days  this was the culmination of eight months of hard work  in fact  clear admit checked in with past winners of the competition  an early round judge  and the leader of wharton s overall entrepreneurship program to learn more about the wbpc s structure and impact  many of those interviewed commented on how wharton s longer format provides participants with the opportunity for educational reality checks and feedback from a wide range of judges and competition contributors  even for those who don t make it to the finals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>emily cieri  current managing director of the wharton entrepreneurship program  described the opening round as being a safe environment for all penn students to begin exploring their entrepreneurial ideas   the beginning stage is really open to the whole university  any student can participate  there are no barriers to entry  in that first phase students can submit multiple ideas and get feedback on all of them  the lack of barriers allows us to capture a pretty large and diverse range of ideas and participants   this first optional  advisory  stage allows interested parties to begin the process of fine tuning their idea in preparation for the first competitive round of the wbpc  davis smith      whose business baby com br came in third in the      wbpc and tied for first in harvard s new venture competition  contrasted the two competitions   i was blown away by wharton s competition   he said   it wasn t just a week long thing  it was a year long event  there were multiple levels of feedback  which included a lot of mentoring and coaching  and events to help people refine or think of ideas  connect with mentors  and develop the skills to write a business plan in a clear concise way  while at hbs  it was basically just show up  also wharton s structure led to more teams competing  i think over         teams submitted ideas to wharton the year i competed  at hbs the total was more like     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>over     individuals volunteer as judges for the competition s multiple rounds  providing the opportunity for students to access a wide range of industry expertise and experience   rohan deuskar  a winning team member of the      competition praised the value the competition s incremental stages had for his business  stylitics  as well as the opportunities it created to interact with a wide variety of industry insiders throughout the judging process  the progressive stages  forced us to be structured in our thinking and to begin anticipating the questions we would get from potential investors   deuskar said   the competition was a safe forum for us to receive feedback on the quality of our initial answers   participating in the competition also exposed the stylitics concept to a number of judges who thought the idea had potential  and whose connections to other relevant industry leaders directly led to initial funding and investments for deuskar and his team </paragraph>
    <paragraph>former contestants had differing views on what stage of the process was the most challenging for them  some said that while the final round had its own intensity  it was the second to last round that caused them the most anxiety  eric heil  whose business  rightcare solutions  won the      wbpc  focused on the time limits of the third phase of the competition and how they influenced his team s pitch approach   getting our idea and presentation to a point where it was succinct and relatable in five minutes or less was a challenge  but having the opportunity to take the time to distill and articulate our vision was a good challenge to go through   davis smith agreed  explaining that the second to the last round stuck out as the most challenging for him and his team   there were a good number of judges on the panel  a lot more judges than in the final round  and about    teams competing for   spots  judges were pretty aggressive in their questioning  they weren t afraid to make you look bad  in the final round  in front of a more diverse audience  judges were nicer  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>natasha and chris ashton  competition winners in      for their pet insurance business petplan  elaborated on the importance of communication while saying that the finals were the stage that caused them the most anxiety   each stage was challenging in their own rights but for us the final stage was most challenging  at that point it s not just a great business plan or idea  it s the ability to communicate it to your audience  you must be a great presenter and orator  we weren t the head of the pack in the final round  when we began we were fourth or fifth in the scores  but we managed to put in a stellar presentation  which ultimately landed us the prize  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>david mars      who has been a judge in the first three stages of the competition over the last few years  echoed the importance of clarity when asked what strategies or elements of a business idea impressed or intrigued him the most as a judge  successful teams  get your attention right away and get you to buy the basic idea from the start  then you listen to the rest of the plan  they have five minutes to really get their purpose across  if you have to listen to the whole five minutes before figuring out what they re doing  that puts the team at a disadvantage   mars also suggested that as much as the idea itself must be compelling  team dynamics are equally important  in his assessment he looks  at the team first and the idea second   it s not just one person  how does the main founder bring in others to create a well balanced approach across the competition  operations  finance  marketing  as a founder you can t always do everything  how good have team leaders been at convincing real quality people to join them  at an early stage like this  a ceo or co founder s entire job is selling  selling to their team  selling to investors   and ultimately selling to their potential customers   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit asked previous winners and finalists what words of wisdom or advice they would give to the newest round of finalists   their responses were both inspirational and pragmatic  natasha and chris ashton s advice for finalists was short and to the point   hope is not a plan  just do it   while davis smith reflected that he wished he had gotten to know his competitors better   we re all competitive by nature  especially at wharton  forget about the competition if you can  and get to know them  at the end of the day this is both an opportunity to build your network and enjoy the experience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at some point  similar advice was surely offered to this year s winning team  zenkars  as well as all teams that competed  zenkars winning business idea was focused on a new way to sell used cars directly to consumers via the internet  in their presentation they stressed that their approach would allow consumers to have a more peaceful buying experience while still allowing their business to remain profitable  when asked questions by the judges about how they would compare or differentiate themselves from similar online companies  they were ready to back up their plans with additional nuances as well as financial projections and details </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while the judges deliberated  all eight competitors were also given the chance to present one minute elevator pitches to a larger audience for the michelson people s choice awards  all audience members were permitted to cast their votes for the team they felt came up with the most engaging and convincing summary of their plan  teams all stuck to their allotted time limits and employed a variety of techniques to capture the attention of the audience  which was simultaneously helping itself to a complimentary buffet of chicken</paragraph>
    <paragraph>kabobs  phyllo wrapped asparagus  tempura shrimp and oozing baked brie  zenkars stood out with their humorous sketch in which the team leader jean mathieu chabas     and team member venkat jonnala     acted out a scenario wherein chabas sought to purchase a used car but wasn t sure where to start  venkat then appeared and persuaded chabas that zenkars would be the best choice  this was made more humorous by chabas  choice of dress   informal athletic gear instead of the suit and tie he wore during their formal presentation   as well as an american accent  chabas  contributions to their main presentation would suggest that he is a francophone   they concluded their pitch by joking that all wharton students would receive a      discount for any car they purchased through the site </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during the lull that occurred while people s choice ballots were being tallied and judges continued to determine their picks for the competition s overall winners  the crowd gathered at the base of the steps in huntsman hall s forum in anticipation  student organizers  as well as wharton entrepreneurship program organizers emily cieri and jill anick  extended gratitude to the numerous individuals who helped plan and organize the event  from all the judges and advisors to the underwriters of top prizes  eventually the crowd hushed as the two co chairs and hosts of the event  fraz ahmed     and lane rettig      took to the stage to announce the winners  they began with the gloeckner award  a         prize given to the highest ranking wharton undergraduate team that competed in the wbpc  this honor went to alphax  which developed a  early stage anti inflammatory small molecule drug  that would allow those suffering rheumatoid arthritis to avoid painful and repetitive drug injections in favor of an oral alternative  next  the people s choice awards were announced  while zenkars may have gotten the loudest laughs  it was maculens that prevailed   the maculens team  comprised of two wharton mba students   one of whom was pursuing a dual mba md degree   hopes to bring a new product to market that will reduce the risks and hassles of the glare of headlights and other bright lights that one often experiences when driving  the product itself could be applied to drivers  glasses  car windows and many other surfaces  and could also be potentially beneficial to professional athletes competing at night </paragraph>
    <paragraph>then it was on to the top three overall winners  coming in third was top trender  a company focused on spotting fashion trends and helping buyers of department stores and clothing companies determine the styles that would be most likely to hit big in upcoming seasons through an online game  the second place winner was maculens  and for the perlman grand prize of          it was zenkars for the win </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the day long event concluded with the cheers of friends and contestants  and the smiling and relieved expressions of the winners as they were mobbed by well wishers and asked to pose for numerous photographs  while there could be only one winner  all contestants benefited from the exposure and guidance the wbpc provided  and there is little doubt that even those outside of the top three have bright futures ahead of them </paragraph>

  <title>alternative lenders could offer new options for foreign students at u s  business schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>private student lending shrank sharply during the financial crisis  and though traditional lenders have cautiously returned to making loans to u s  citizens  non americans looking to attend business school in the united states often are hard pressed to find financing options that don t require a u s  co signer  but according to a recent article in the financial times  peer to peer lenders and crowdfunding start ups could present new opportunities for foreign students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one peer to peer lender  sofi  which hopes to lend    billion this year  has been in discussions with several u s  business schools about extending loans to foreign students that would be funded by alumni from their home country  the ft reports  meanwhile  pave  a crowdfunding start up that lets students raise money from backers in exchange for a share of future income  is also considering expanding to other countries  the ft adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most existing loan programs for overseas students are funded by banks or credit unions but guaranteed by business schools themselves  which leaves schools exposed to the risk of default and has made some schools reluctant to lend to foreign students  columbia business school  for example  will only lend to foreign students who have a u s  co signer  directing other students to seek scholarships and loans from institutions in their home countries </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the default rate is higher for international students   mark kantrowitz  publisher of student finance website finaid org  told the ft   it is very difficult for any lender to collect from someone who s overseas  in the u s  you could sue and get their wages garnished  deducted   but you can t do that overseas  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alternative lenders like sofi and pave rely on social components to address default risk  sofi  for its part  exerts social pressure on borrowers who feel an affinity with alumni investors  mike cagney  sofi chief executive  told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>pave and other crowdsourcing start ups  meanwhile  tie payments to the borrower s own financial success  giving investors cause to mentor borrowers and help with networking and job referrals   i have an incentive to help him succeed   explains pave co founder sal lahoud about a potential borrower  if a borrower does well  the backing investor receives the initial investment and more  but borrowers don t have to repay during years when their income falls below a certain level </paragraph>

  <title>current chicago booth student touts value of mba for entrepreneurs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an mba student at the university of chicago booth school of business this week shared her perspective in forbes on why an mba makes sense for entrepreneurs  stella fayman  who is concurrently launching a startup while pursuing an mba at booth  wrote in part in response to an op ed earlier this week in the wall street journal advising startups not to hire mbas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rattling off    successful companies all started by mbas from top business schools   angie s list  grubhub  warby parker and yelp  just to name a few   fayman offers three main arguments in favor of the mba  they attract top talent  they can be a  sandbox  for starting a company and they provide structured support </paragraph>
    <paragraph> mba programs are intensely competitive  with top    programs having an acceptance rate of less than    percent   fayman writes   this means that by taking part in a program  you ll be exposed to people with experiences that will blow your mind   these classmates will become your future network and may even include future business partners  she notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>surrounded by these smart  ambitious people  in an environment where you can recruit for a job in the event that your idea doesn t pan out  and with the structured mentorship and access to resources that many top schools provide through entrepreneurship centers   that s business school  fayman writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the decision  for an entrepreneur  of whether or not to go the mba route is personal and should depend on your own experiences and goals  fayman acknowledges   so the best first step is to talk to people who you admire on both sides of the fence  analyze the alternatives and look at your long term goals   she advises </paragraph>

    <paragraph>insead  with campuses in france and singapore  boasted a global mba program well before many other top business schools began to establish satellites for their programs in regions around the world  having now added a new abu dhabi module to its core mba program  insead is expanding its international reach even farther </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the abu dhabi location got its start as a research center in      and grew into a full fledged campus in       offering executive education and executive mba programs  as part of the new module rolled out this year  students can now spend a week in january  a week in february and a concluding weekend in march as part of the core mba program  enjoying lectures  guest speakers  field trips to and group projects with local companies  alumni networking and visits to recruiters  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>acknowledging that competition is fierce and that successful internships are among the most important stepping stones to securing a job upon graduation  they are still just a  low cost experiment  for firms and students to feel the other out  kumar told the economist   the truth is that a lot of people don t stay in their first job very long but go on to have great careers   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dean kumar also encouraged mba students to consider taking an entrepreneurship course as an academic subject even if they don t have any intention of becoming an entrepreneur   it provides an academic capstone experience   he told the economist   the basic conceit of being an entrepreneur having an idea and moving that idea forward is useful whether you work for yourself or within a company  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>technology does and will continue to play an important role in business education  kumar said  noting that chicago booth has established a studio on its main campus in chicago to enable professors to reach students on the school s other campuses in london and singapore  the school has also created a way to connect mba students on its various campuses with others who share similar entrepreneurial ideas   using algorithms like those used by dating websites like match com </paragraph>

    <paragraph>richmond s comments appeared in a bloomberg businessweek article entitled   how to stand out in an mba group interview   the university of michigan s ross school of business is the latest top mba program to require applicants to work as a group as part of the application process  joining switzerland s imd and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  bloomberg bw notes  though the schools are taking this step in an effort to elicit more off the cuff responses from applicants  there are still ways to prepare for these new exercises </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit s richmond advises learning as much as you can about the format of the group exercise and what a particular school is trying to test through it  in addition to trying to get unscripted responses from applicants  the schools are also using team interviews to evaluate how well applicants listen  their overall communication skills  the level of intellectual curiosity they possess and  of course  how they work as part of a group  richmond told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for more tips from richmond  as well as from admissions directors at some of the schools incorporating group interviews  check out the complete bloomberg bw post </paragraph>

    <paragraph>but clear admit provides applicants with much more than just a dress rehearsal for the group interview  ingram notes   i really view my job as akin to being a guidance counselor   he told the dp   it s really helpful for students in their twenties to put a lot of deep thought into what their career goals are  what do you want to do when you grow up  why mba  we help people think through those questions  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>as reported here in january  the ross school of business at the university of michigan plans to officially launch team based interviews as part of its mba admissions process in       following wharton s lead  an article this week in bloomberg businessweek sheds some light on the approach ross is taking  as evidenced through pilot efforts the admissions team conducted with roughly     applicants in beijing  shanghai and ann arbor this past admissions season </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like wharton  ross is seeking to assess how applicants interact with one another through the new team based exercises  the format the michigan school is using  however  differs from wharton s  in which candidates are sent a question in advance and then grouped with other applicants to present a team solution  at ross  the pilot exercises held in january and february involved applicants first approaching a task individually and then as a group  according to the bloomberg bw report  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ross applicants   in groups of four to six   were first given    minutes to prepare individual presentations connecting two random words in any way they chose  next  the group was given a set of random words and    minutes to use the words to address a problem and solution as a team </paragraph>
    <paragraph> different things come out in a group interview   soojin kwon  ross director of admissions  told bloomberg bw   it creates a more complete picture of what the applicant will be like in a classroom and in our community   random words were used to prevent applicants from preparing in advance  kwon added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to test the new format  some of the applicants invited for the traditional one on one interview were encouraged to participate in the group exercise  though their performance would not be part of their application evaluation  the ross admission committee told them  kwon told bloomberg bw that she hopes to implement the team based interview more broadly next year  but that the logistics of how to bring together interviewees and evaluators may make it hard to use with all applicants  evaluators for the pilot group interviews at ross were alumni and second year students </paragraph>

  <title>spain s esade plans to expand focus on africa</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>esade business school in spain plans to expand its focus on africa  both as a place to do business and as a place from which to attract more prospective business school students  as part of this effort  the barcelona school hosted a panel discussion earlier this week to inspire current students to consider work in africa  the financial times reported </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the number one goal of this event was to open students  minds to the opportunities in africa   katie carr  who is esade s regional director for europe  the middle east  africa and india  told the ft  carr was appointed to the role six months ago and immediately decided to analyze the school s connections to each of the regional areas she oversees  among her discoveries  more prospective applicants took the graduate management admission test  gmat  in nigeria than in spain  and yet students from the entire continent make up only   to   percent of esade s incoming classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more of carr s analysis uncovered the fact that very few esade students consider the african continent as a possible region for future job opportunities  according to the ft  and so the idea for monday s panel event was born  the event consisted of five panelists sharing experiences about their work in africa and the opportunities they see there for graduating business school students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the panelists  shaun gause  decided to form a trade development and consulting firm in sierra leone after completing the georgetown esade global emba two years ago  gause had previously been involved in charitable healthcare activities targeting africa  but they left him feeling frustrated </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my previous work in africa involved me chasing after money and equipment  while it made an impact  it only lasted as long as the money was there  then you had to go and get more money   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  as chief executive and co founder of global group inc  ggi   gause invests the money of wealthy individuals in projects chosen by ggi on a not for profit basis  with their principal protected  investors can choose to share in any profit a project makes  but profit is not their main aim  the ft reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gause acknowledges that there is a lack of appetite  particularly coming from the west  for africa as a business destination  but he underscores the rewards he thinks can be found there   you can go there and learn not just how to survive  but how to thrive   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph> they say necessity is the mother of invention  if you take the lessons you learned in africa and apply them in the us and europe you might find you learned more than you expected   he adds </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school  stanford share number one spot again in u s  news   world report rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>u s  news   world report released its annual ranking of business schools yesterday  revealing little change at the very top from last year  harvard business school and stanford graduate school of business tied for first  and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school came in third again </paragraph>
    <paragraph>massachusetts institute of technology s sloan school of management and northwestern university s kellogg school of management tied for number four  last year  the university of chicago s booth school of business shared in a three way tie for that spot  but this year it slipped down to sixth  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rounding out the top ten were uc berkeley s haas school of management      columbia business school      dartmouth s tuck school of business     and new york university s stern school of business      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the u s  news rankings are based on a weighted average of several indicators  including overall program quality  peer assessments  recruiter assessments  placement success  mean starting salary and bonus  average gmat score and gpa and more  to compile this year s rankings  all     master s programs accredited by aacsb international were surveyed in fall      and early           of which responded </paragraph>
    <paragraph>notably  yale school of management  som   which ranked tenth last year  fell to number     something of a surprise to some in the mba community who have been closely watching the significant changes new dean ed snyder  formerly dean of both darden and booth  has been making at the school since taking over two years ago  but a closer look at the indexed scores u s  news uses to compile the rankings shows that yale s stayed steady at     the same as it was last year  instead  it was increases in scores for nyu stern       duke s fuqua school of business      and uva s darden school of business      that resulted in yale som s slip in the overall lineup </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  those of us at clear admit encourage prospective applicants to use rankings as just one component in a thorough investigation of schools and programs when trying to assess where to apply </paragraph>

    <paragraph>the exhibit   building the foundation  business education for women at harvard university              reveals the many ways in which women were a part of hbs long before the      hbs faculty vote that led to women s admission directly into the first year of the mba program  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  as the exhibit showcases  women first began studying business at harvard university in       as part of the training course in personnel administration at radcliffe college  later known as the harvard radcliffe program in business administration   a certificate program  hbs professor fritz roethlisberger called it  the first daring experiment in  practical education  for women    an opening that would lead  albeit    years later  to the first eight female students enrolled in the      hbs two year mba program  alongside     men  by       women were fully integrated into the program  the school adds </paragraph>

  <title>admission into harvard business school with a     gmat score  clear admit s graham richmond shares how it might happen</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs   which publicly discloses the range of gmat scores by enrolled students every year  got folks in the mba admissions world talking when it revealed that a student with a score of     will be part of next year s class  how could someone who scored     points below the class median on a test considered by many to forecast business school success possibly still get in  to hbs  of all places  where only    percent of the close to       eager applicants this year secured a spot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>poetsandquants  p q  posed the question to the hbs admissions staff  which declined to shed any light on the successful candidate  so p q then turned to mba admissions consultants  clear admit s graham richmond among them  to guess about just what might be going on in the offices of hbs mba dean of admissions dee leopold  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for one thing  it seems like some schools must really mean it when they state that gmat scores are but one of many factors they take into consideration when carefully considering each candidate to build the strongest possible overall mba class  clear admit s richmond noted that it s hard for him to speculate without seeing the candidate s file for that very reason </paragraph>
    <paragraph> mba admissions at the very best schools is truly a multi variable equation  comprised of so many different factors that it can be hard to pull out a single data point and build the rest of the profile around it   he told p q  his fascination with the fact that there are so many different moving parts and that each candidate is given a fair chance is part of what compelled him to take a job in admission at wharton and ultimately to co found clear admit  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but if speculate he must  richmond suggested that in order to be accepted in spite of the unusually low  by hbs standards  gmat score  the candidate would almost definitely have to have excelled consistently in every other part of the application   undergraduate profile  work experience  outside activities  letters of recommendation  leadership skills  personal background  and even that would not have been enough  he continued   as such  i would venture that the candidate also had something fairly incredible in their background   likely leadership oriented   that truly made an impact   he told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>knowing leopold and the admissions team she leads at hbs   which would only be looking to admit a candidate who could fit right into the rigorous  case method driven hbs classroom   richmond further points out that they probably looked extremely closely at the academic portion of the candidate s file  considering not only the gpa but also the caliber of the undergraduate institution  the rigor of specific courses completed and other evidence of academic aptitude to offset the gmat score  such as outside coursework  comments in letters or recommendation letters  etc     they might also consider any extenuating circumstances around the gmat result itself   e g  if the candidate lives in a remote market and was only able to fly to a test site to sit the exam once amidst a busy work schedule   richmond pointed out to p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to all of this  richmond still puts his money on the candidate having had some sort of unprecedented leadership experience   for example  i recently learned that the head of the nfl players union was admitted to hbs   and although i have no idea how that candidate s academic profile measured up  it s clear that having that sort of incredible leadership background made him highly competitive for a spot in the hbs class   he told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  all of these things together wouldn t be enough to overcome the gmat score unless they were presented as part of a compelling overall application complete with cogent  thought provoking essays  powerful letters of recommendations from people who really know the candidate  and an out of the park interview   finally  i d add that it wouldn t hurt if the candidate also happened to come from an under represented portion of the applicant pool   be it socioeconomically  ethnically  industry wise or geographically   richmond concluded </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s kevin chen gives advice to asian mba applicants targeting top business schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>navigating the mba admissions process in the united states and europe is a tricky task  even for applicants familiar with the expectations of the western academic and corporate cultures  however  the process presents special challenges for east asian applicants  who often possess cultural assumptions that can work to their disadvantage  clear admit admissions counselor kevin chen has nearly a decade of mba admissions consulting expertise  and has worked extensively with asian applicants to help them overcome these cultural hurdles and gain admission to top mba programs including harvard business school  stanford gsb  wharton  chicago booth  insead and london business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chen  who is fluent in english  chinese and taiwanese  has been a successful applicant himself  he holds master s degrees from both stanford s graduate school of business and harvard s kennedy school of government  he also has a wealth of relevant professional experience  as a consultant  marketing professional and writer for firms including mckinsey   company  the national basketball association and reuters  the largest global news agency  last week  clear admit spoke with chen about the common missteps and trends he observes in asian mba applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> ca  gaining admission to top business programs may be particularly competitive for asian applicants  given this fact  what general pieces of advice would you give young professionals from asia about how to stand out during the mba application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  my first piece of advice would be this  when answering essay questions  it is paramount that applicants directly respond to the actual questions being asked  before providing additional or tangential information that they feel supports these responses  this is different from the way many asian cultures tend to communicate which is to provide general background information and analysis first  and often only explicitly answering the question at hand in their concluding lines  american and european admissions committees really prefer to know the overall direction or point a writer is trying to make from the outset </paragraph>
    <paragraph>furthermore  when discussing accomplishments  i tell asian applicants to focus on the impact they created rather than the awards that they won  admissions committees are more interested in the contributions an applicant has made to a larger organization than in the praise an applicant received for doing so  similarly  do not discuss getting into a prestigious school or receiving a job offer from a prestigious company as an accomplishment  in the eyes of the admissions committees  it is only an accomplishment if you can demonstrate how specifically you ve made good use of the opportunities from getting into a prestigious school or company </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  as an admissions counselor  what are some common misconceptions about the mba admissions process you ve encountered when advising asian applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  i would say there are four key misconceptions i ve encountered </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first  many asian applicants mistakenly believe that it s fine to quit your job just because you re applying to business school studying for the gmat is not a legitimate reason for quitting your job  admissions committee officers expect you to be able to  walk and chew gum at the same time  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second  many asian applicants try too hard to be  different  e g  trying to pretend to be an entrepreneur when nothing in the background points to being an entrepreneur </paragraph>
    <paragraph>third  many asian applicants mistakenly believe that it s a great strategy to get a recommendation letter from the most senior executive  even when it s clear to the admissions committee that the senior executive really would not have worked with the applicant extensively </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fourth  and finally  many asian applicants believe that  ranking  dictates almost      how hard or easy it is to get into a school  and that  if i get rejected from school a  and school a is generally ranked higher than school b  then i must have no shot at getting into school b so i shouldn t even try   the reality is that admissions committees also take into account the applicant s fit with the school in terms of their personality  interests  background and goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  broadly  what trends would you say you observed in asian applicants to mba programs this year  and how does this differ from what you ve observed over the course of your time at clear admit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  i would say more asian applicants are now considering asia based business schools  such as ceibs  china europe international business school  in china and hkust  hong kong university of science and technology  in hong kong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  specifically  what did you observe about these applicants in terms of target schools  what about in terms of post mba target industries </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  asian applicants tend to weigh the brand prestige of schools even more heavily than american and european applicants  to put it bluntly  you can look at the us news   world report rankings and figure out almost      where the applicants would like to go  in the exact order of preference </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of post mba target industries  a much greater percentage of asian applicants want to go into management consulting and investment banking because outside those two industries  compensation in other industries in asia drops off sharply  in other words  there are fewer high paying industries for post mba grads in asia than in the u s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  in your experience  what s the proportion of asian applicants who intend to return to their home countries after receiving an mba  versus those who want to remain in the united states or work elsewhere abroad </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  from what i ve observed  most tend to want to do a few years abroad  mostly in the u s   before returning to their home countries  but whether or not they succeed in finding a job in the u s  depends on the economic situation of any particular year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this preference for working abroad before returning home is partly for the personal experience of working overseas  and partly for a professional reason those who have overseas work experience tend to be able to get higher paying positions after they return to their home countries </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit weighs in on nyu stern s top place among undergrads in bloomberg businessweek survey</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a recent article about the most sought after business schools for undergraduate students  new york university s stern school of business topped the short list  along with harvard business school  columbia business school  the university of chicago booth school of business and stanford graduate school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg businessweek  which reported the top five as lead up to its      undergraduate business school rankings  which will be published later this month  expressed surprise at nyu stern s inclusion in the mix </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but clear admit co founder graham richmond told bloomberg bw that he thinks stern s mid tier ranking overall is  in fact  a benefit when it comes to attracting potential applicants   when you pick the list of schools you re applying to  you usually have a couple of reach schools  a couple of schools right down the middle and then a couple of safety schools   he told bloomberg bw   nyu is versatile enough that it ends up on a lot of people s lists  in some cases it s the reach school  and in others it s the safety  depending on the candidate   he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of bloomberg bw s      undergraduate business school ranking  senior business school students were asked about their future plans  of those  more than        said that they were planning to pursue an mba in the next five years  and of the prospective mba students     percent named stern as a target school  compared to    percent for harvard business school and uptown rival columbia business school     percent for the university of chicago s booth school of business  and    percent for stanford s graduate school of business   bloomberg bw notes that respondents could choose more than one target school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit s richmond notes that nyu stern s location in new york city could be a factor in how highly it ranked as a target school among prospective business school applicants   there must be a new york bias   he told bloomberg bw   because that s where the jobs are  </paragraph>

    <paragraph> the increase among chinese women is miraculous   elissa ellis sangster  executive director of the forte foundation  a consortium of companies and business schools working to advance women in business  told bloomberg businessweek   i think it s a great story of the global economy  and i do think developing countries will start to take a closer look at women and their impact on the workforce   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the trio of reports from gmac also revealed other key trends about test takers  including the fact that younger people make up a greater percentage of test takers than in the past  specifically     percent of test takers in testing year      were younger than     up from    percent in       and in asian and european countries  more than half of all test takers were under     gmac reports </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler discusses preparing mba applicants for wharton s team based discussion</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>rather than simulating a group interview  clear admit admissions consultants are preparing mba applicants for the new team based discussion  tbd  component of the university of pennsylvania s wharton school application by helping them focus and hone the ideas they will present as part of the exercise  senior admissions counselor stacey oyler told poetsandquants  p q  as part of an article published yesterday </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we decided that trying to simulate a group interview wasn t the ideal approach for prepping candidates   oyler told p q  instead  she and other clear admit admissions counselors are helping clients focus on the compelling ideas they will present as part of the tbd  setting expectations for what the interview setting will be like   including the types of other applicants they may be grouped with   and sharing insight about what wharton will be assessing  oyler continued  clear admit  founded by two wharton mba alumni  including one who worked in the wharton admissions office after graduating  prides itself on its wharton expertise   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in its current form  wharton applicants invited to take part in the tbd view a video of dean thomas robertson discussing the school s three pillars   social impact  global presence and innovation   and are then asked how they would invest a hypothetical    million donation  wharton introduced the tbd component as an official part of the application process this year in an effort to  assess applicants in  an unscripted environment   free from the influence of admission consultants and other advice givers   according to the p q article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in response  some other admissions consulting firms have opted to create new offerings   online simulations designed to mimic the tbd   to help prepare applicants who are anxious about the new component of wharton s application  p q reports  prospective applicants pay between      and      each to participate with other prospective applicants as part of these mock discussions  p q adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at clear admit  preparation for the wharton tbd comes as part of its traditional admissions consulting offerings  oyler told p q   we talk with clients about the three pillars and encourage them to come up with great ideas for each one   oyler continued   we work with them on fine tuning their elevator pitch  and we know from our own group interview experience that wharton is looking for candidates who can showcase strong interpersonal skills and who are able to facilitate the discussion while contributing their own unique ideas and encouraging thoughts from others  </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler sheds light on mba summer internship hiring process at top firms like mckinsey</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s first year internship recruiting season at business schools across the united states  as students scramble to line up interviews with potential employers  they confront a complex process made even more complicated by the demands of their first year core coursework and other campus commitments  last week  clear admit spoke with stacey oyler  a clear admit admissions consultant and former mckinsey   co  mba recruiter  to shed light on this process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after joining mckinsey  oyler initiated a formal recruiting process for the firm on the campus of dartmouth s tuck school of business  her familiarity with the school she worked previously as the assistant director of admissions at tuck and its approach to the recruiting process allowed her great insight into how mckinsey could approach potential new hires  for example   one unique thing about tuck is that they have a bid list   said oyler   you  as a student  are given a certain number of points that you can use towards bidding on interviews   oyler said about     of mckinsey s total number of interview slots were reserved for bid students   of the remaining     we got to choose who we wanted to see  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of oyler s key pieces of advice was to be flexible geographically   we would have students list three offices where they would be willing to work  and nine times out of ten students chose only the  sexiest  places   she said   these included cities like new york  san francisco and london  but ultimately  the less glamorous offices are the ones with openings   what ends up happening is that the office decides based on  a student s indication of  location who they want to see   so if you ve only indicated that you re willing to work in new york  san fransisco or london  an office in philadelphia that has positions open may not even consider your application </paragraph>
    <paragraph> don t think about geography as where you want to live   said oyler   think about where you would be valued and where you could most utilize your skill set  students never say that they want to work in cleveland  but cleveland needs people  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> do you want to work in boston   she summarized bluntly   or do you want to work at mckinsey  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the management consulting interview process itself which oyler clarified differs from that of other industries is well defined  it consists of two rounds  one on campus interview with a recruiter  followed by on site interviews at office locations if applicants clear the first round  it may be surprising for some to learn that this internship interview process is exactly the same as for full time positions    we had  a bar  and  weren t  going to lower that bar for summer internships   said oyler </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each interview begins with ten minutes of resume review followed by a thirty minute business case  drawn from a large book of potential cases   the consultants conducting the interview pick their favorites  usually by industry   oyler said  noting that there s also a constant process of weeding out old cases that have been leaked and used as preparation material by applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s understandable that first year students want to know how they can excel during their interviews  but just as important to their success is knowing how to avoid committing a fatal mistake   the single biggest mistake students make in their interviews   oyler said   is that they are afraid of silence  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the cases used by management consulting firms like mckinsey require the applicant to solve fairly complex business problems on the spot  but they don t require or expect them to solve it instantaneously  said oyler </paragraph>
    <paragraph> students are often so afraid that if they spend too long working on a problem they won t look smart   she said   then they rush  and they build an entire business case around the wrong number  as an example   even if they get everything else right  it s hard to say they performed well if they got the data wrong and the wrong answer  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> thoughtful silence is so much better than speaking and hoping your mind catches up with your mouth   she added   it never does  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>oyler described the interviews themselves as an extremely meritocratic process   our goal was  whoever does well goes on   said oyler   there is no target number or quota we were trying to get to   moreover  she said that many of the best applicants she recruited at tuck came from non traditional backgrounds fields like journalism or the liberal arts  which are underrepresented at business schools   a lot of people want to do consulting  but they don t think they have the background   she said  acknowledging that in certain cases students do benefit from a degree of specialization and expertise in one field   but it s really about problem solving and critical thinking  and anybody can do that  leaders are problem solvers at the end of the day  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>often even more impressive than the non traditional applicants  in oyler s experience  were the bid candidates students who may have sacrificed interview opportunities at other firms to ensure getting a shot at their dream internship   they want it more   she observed   often  when we would select someone  they would also interview with bain  bcg  boston consulting group    firms that along with mckinsey constitute the so called  big three  strategy consulting firms   but if you have this candidate who puts all of his bid points on mckinsey  he will probably be really prepared  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most of all  oyler stressed that the students who put in the effort are those who nail the cases   if you are willing to try really hard and pore over cases for hours and hours  you ll do well   she said   this is something you can prepare for  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you re a first year mba student who has just completed a grueling round of interviews and landed an internship at your dream firm  congratulations  what can you expect your summer job to look like  the eight week internship experience is structured to be simultaneously positive and challenging  according to oyler </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at consulting firms like mckinsey  mba interns are treated as  summer associates   responsible for performing the same duties as new hires for full time positions  if interns perform well over the course of the summer  they may earn full time offers with the firm   you keep the bar high during internship interviews precisely for this reason   said oyler </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to acclimating students to the demands of the industry  the internship is designed to leave them with a positive impression of the firm   offices are making an effort to put them  interns  on interesting projects   she said   this is because firms hope to ensure a  high yield  of students who accept full time offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you are wined and dined but also evaluated   said oyler   overall  it is a pretty intense experience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what does this information mean for business school applicants  for whom first year summer internships are just a distant light at the end of the long mba application tunnel  it s all about understanding as early as possible what you want to do with your mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>large firms like mckinsey recruit mbas primarily from a small number of  core  schools  while mckinsey doesn t reveal the names of these programs  and oyler is bound by confidentiality not to share them  she did reveal that students at these schools have a key advantage when it comes to securing internships   a mckinsey consultant  typically an alumnus or alumna of the school  is often staffed at each of these schools during the school year to host office hours and brown bag lunches  helping students prepare for case interviews and learn more about the firm </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the other hand  a single recruiting team oversees mckinsey mba recruiting for all non core mba programs  this underscores how essential it is that applicants do their due diligence on target schools    it s very important that applicants have some ideas and are looking at career prospects for their schools of interest  if you re dead set on working for a big three consulting firm   oyler said   you have to find out where they are recruiting  why spend          on a school if the company you want to work for doesn t recruit there  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this point applies across firms  industries and continents  one student seeking a job in the energy industry  for instance  might develop a drastically different list of target schools than a student considering a career in management consulting  as a general rule  the key is to be proactive about defining your career goals and diligent about researching mba programs that fit them </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this should be factored into your school decision making process   oyler concluded   you need a return on your investment  right  </paragraph>

  <title>new wharton  hbs research reveals last interviewee of the day often fares worst</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a recent research paper co authored by professors from the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and harvard business school reveals that mba applicants interviewing at the end of a day after a series of strong candidates are more likely to receive a lower evaluation than they would otherwise </paragraph>
    <paragraph>terming the phenomenon  narrow bracketing   the researchers conjectured that interviewers charged with evaluating a subset of applicants in a given day tended to try to provide evaluations in keeping with the overall expectations for the entire interview pool  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> for instance  an interviewer who has already highly recommended three applicants on a given day may be reluctant to do so for a fourth applicant   wrote uri simonsohn  an operations and information management professor at wharton  and francesca gino  an associate professor of business administration at hbs  data from more than       mba admissions interviewers supported the prediction </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the paper  entitled  daily horizons  evidence of narrow bracketing in judgment from    years of mba admission interviews   was published in the february      issue of psychological science  the researchers found that a similarly qualified applicant who interviewed on the tail end of a series of top scoring applicants got worse than expected evaluations  in the reverse situation  when a similarly qualified applicant interviewed after a group of weaker competitors  that applicant got better than expected evaluations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>simonsohn and gino hypothesize that an interviewer may be reluctant to give high ratings to the last candidate in a string of highly rated candidates because he or she knows that only a certain percentage of individuals are accepted into a program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> an interviewer who expects to evaluate positively about    percent of applicants in a pool may be reluctant to evaluate positively many more or fewer than    percent of applicants on any given day  an applicant who happens to interview on a day when several others have already received a positive evaluation would  therefore  be at a disadvantage   they write </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the problem with this narrow bracketing behavior is that the subsets arbitrarily created by the scheduling of the interviews should not influence the interviewers  judgments   while the merit of an mba applicant may partially depend on the pool of applicants that year  it should not depend on the few others randomly interviewed that day   simonsohn and gino write </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though they studied mba applicant interviews specifically  the researchers say that the phenomenon of narrow bracketing is not confined to academic admissions  indeed  the same dynamic could play out whenever individuals are spreading similar decisions out over multiple days   be they decisions about applicants for loans at a bank or candidates interviewing for a job </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in any setting where people have to make a large set of judgments that is broken down into a small set on the same day  you might see the same thing   simonsohn notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what can applicants do to counteract the narrow bracketing effect  not much  simonsohn and gino say   there s no magic in this for the user  you can t see who you re competing against and often can t control the timing of your interview   when the candidates are spread out over weeks and weeks  your competition is the entire applicant pool and not a subset of that  but in reality  your competition is drawn from two pools   everyone and the other applicants who get interviewed that day  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the researchers do  however  offer suggestions for low cost  low risk ways companies and universities could seek to control for the effect  such as having interviewers enter each applicant s scores into a spreadsheet or database program that would help them monitor the results of their interviews over time  taking the focus off a given day s candidates </paragraph>

  <title>university of chicago booth school of business uses technology to connect campuses around the globe</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last month  the university of chicago booth school of business debuted a new telepresence technology it hopes will help establish a  new global connectivity  between faculty and students at the school s main chicago campus and those in other locations around the globe  such as london and singapore </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the technology   enhanced videoconferencing featuring superior sight and sound fidelity   enabled chicago booth professor of economics kevin murphy to deliver a one hour lecture on the importance of human capital to economic growth to executive mba students in main lecture auditorium at chicago booth s london campus  inaugurating the new technology  murphy delivered his lecture live from a studio in the harper center  which houses the full time mba program in chicago  while students in london used desk mounted microphones to ask questions and interact with the professor  murphy  for his part  could control three cameras stationed in the london auditorium  directing them on the questioner and other students in the classroom </paragraph>
    <paragraph>robert gertner  deputy dean for chicago booth s part time program  said that the technology is intended to connect booth s global campuses by allowing all faculty members to reach students across all the locations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think it accomplished the goal   gertner said after the lecture   it was a way more interactive experience than listening to a web version of a presentation  the live nature makes it easier to absorb the material  and the ability to ask questions makes it closer to being live than watching a webcast  it will only get better as people get better at using it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>going forward  chicago booth will use the telepresence technology to broadcast sessions with other faculty and guest speakers from the harper studio  as well as to conduct remote review sessions before exams </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this was the first use of a technology that is designed not to be a substitute for faculty being here  but as a complement and a way for us to bring more of the faculty to the students who are not in chicago   gertner said </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>how to become better active listeners  how to provide constructive feedback  how to establish collaborative environments conducive to innovative thinking   these are among the valuable  soft  skills mba students at the haas school of management at the university of california at berkeley are learning as part of a new program called teams haas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program  which debuted this year during haas orientation week  is a new component of the berkeley innovative leader development  bild  curriculum  full time mba students dove into the new initiative last fall by forming diverse semester long study groups and together developing collaboration plans for working across boundaries  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> unlike when we operate as individuals and we can practice reflexivity  in a group we need to carve out time to exchange information and understand how we perceive the situation   brandi pearce  an organizational behaviorist who leads the new program  explained </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the groups took part in diagnostic and feedback sessions after a month  individuals had the opportunity to describe anonymously how the team was functioning at periodic checkpoints  and all students completed a survey at the semester s end showing highlighting the evolution of the teams and best practices </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students praised the inaugural teams haas program   while we had all worked on teams in our previous jobs  haas challenged us by putting us in more diverse teams than those we experienced at work   said felice espiritu  mba mph     espiritu was in a group that included students from switzerland  india  the east coast and a range of industries   but haas also gave us the resources to set us up for success and deal with issues that arose in a way that focused on our long term personal goals and leadership development   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>espiritu s team reached out to pearce for help as it encountered challenges  and pearce was at the ready to assist   what brandi helped facilitate was establishing the group norm for how we communicate with each other and how we work with each other what s acceptable  what s not and how we prioritize our work   espiritu said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this semester  pearce and a team of coaches will work with full time and part time mba students to help bring some of the teams haas skills to bear as part of group projects they participate in during their required experiential learning courses </paragraph>

  <title>plagiarized admissions essays doom mba applicants at top schools  again</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>fifteen prospective applicants to ucla s anderson school of management and another    at penn state s smeal college of business got dinged when a plagiarism spotting service revealed that portions of their admissions essays had been lifted from other sources  bloomberg businessweek reports today  the schools say those numbers are likely to grow in subsequent admissions rounds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>both smeal and anderson use a service called turnitin for admissions  which checks admissions essays against a database of published and unpublished sources and flags similarities  in total  about    schools use turnitin  according to company spokesman chris harrick  but only four have publically disclosed that fact   northeastern s d amore mckim school of business and wake forest schools of business also make their use of turnitin public  though no applicants have been rejected for plagiarism at either school so far this year  bloomberg bw reports   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last year  anderson rejected    applicants for plagiarism as part of the first two rounds  andrew ainslie  senior associate dean for the full time mba program  told bloomberg bw that he expects that as many as    applicants may be rejected for plagiarism this year by the end of the third and final round </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to craig hubbell  director of operations for mba admissions at anderson  most of the applicants who have been discovered plagiarizing this year borrowed passages from essay websites  although some were brazen   or stupid   enough to lift from bloomberg bw and even anderson s own website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the bloomberg bw report  anderson doesn t disclose its use of turnitin to applicants  and it only rejects students whose essays include a significant amount of poached text   if somebody uses a famous quote in an essay  we re not going to highlight it   ainslie told bloomberg bw   when it does occur  it s because they took a big chunk   like one applicant last year who lifted    percent of an essay and failed to change the gender of the pronouns  hubbell gave as an example to bloomberg bw </paragraph>

    <paragraph>according to ft business education editor della bradshaw  hbs was able to rise to the top of the rankings thanks in part to its new dean   one of the things we measure in our rankings is the international perspective and achievement of the programs   bradshaw said in a video interview on the ft site   dean nitin nohria  who is the first harvard dean born outside north america  has taken over and has brought that ethos to the school   she continued  hbs also has added new compulsory oversees elements for its students as part of its mba program  which bradshaw believes may have helped hbs regain ground as well  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of larger trends  bradshaw noted that canadian and european business schools are falling in the rankings as asian schools move up  the top     mba schools include    from asia this year  the most ever  among european schools  business schools in the united kingdom have slipped the most  though london business school has ranked in the top five for the past decade and cambridge s judge school moved up an impressive    spots this year to number     five u k schools fell out of the top     completely  overall     u k  schools made the rankings  down from    in      </paragraph>

  <title>bloomberg businessweek taps clear admit for insight on business school admissions in india</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>only      percent of applicants to india s top business school were admitted for the         academic period  making stanford graduate school of business  with a   percent acceptance rate  and harvard business school     percent  look easy to get into by comparison  according to a recent bloomberg businessweek article  bloomberg bw turned to clear admit co founder graham richmond to provide a little context </paragraph>
    <paragraph> india s population is so large  particularly among young people  it s easy for  iima  to have the luxury of making one huge cut   richmond told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  iima received         applications for the class of       compared with stanford s        and cut         of them  largely according to entrance exam scores  all iima applicants are required to take india s common application test  or cat </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nunzio quacquarelli  director of the qs world mba tour  told bloomberg bw that most of the people he sees applying to iim s    schools are indian  around    years old and have one or two years of work experience  in contrast  bw data reveals that applicants to stanford average    years old and have almost five years of work experience  giving admissions committees much more to compare </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while using the cat to reject such a huge percentage of applicants to iima may also make dealing with the sheer volume of applications possible  some question whether it provides the best indicator of how well students will fare in business school  mba world tour s quacquarelli notes that more test centric admissions may result in less diversity  noting that an overwhelming majority of iima students come from engineering backgrounds and that the school has fewer female students than other internationally recognized business schools </paragraph>

  <title>professor from uva s darden school of business sends mba students to prison to teach entrepreneurship</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>entrepreneurship education is spreading like wildfire  with top business schools enhancing their offerings by launching new institutes  expanding curriculum components and investing more in business incubators  a professor at the darden school of business at the university of virginia at charlottesville sees no reason why it should stop there  through a program he launched last year  he s sending darden students armed with the case study method into prisons to teach inmates how to start small businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>greg fairchild  associate professor at darden  studies entrepreneurship and business development in inner cities and other underserved areas and has published on topics ranging from the effects of residential segregation on entrepreneurship to the evolution of community development financial institutions  cdfis   last year  fairchild and a group of students traveled to houston to visit a nonprofit called prison entrepreneurship program  pep   which recruits mba students from around the country to help inmates develop business plans  pep s goal is to reduce recidivism by equipping inmates with business and life skills they can use upon release  according to pep s annual report  only   percent of its graduates end up back in jail  compared to the    percent of overall inmates released from the texas department of criminal justice who return to prison within three years  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the outgrowth of fairchild s visit to pep was a new program at darden called resilience education  through which darden mbas provide entrepreneurship education for inmates at two prisons in virginia  to qualify  inmates must first complete the prison s vocational education program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a lot of the students say they have never been in a classroom where they have felt this engaged before   fairchild told bloomberg businessweek   the inmates feel inspired that darden students and faculty are coming to see them and teaching  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rates of recidivism are even greater in virginia than they are in texas  with about    percent of inmates returning to prison within three years  according to bloomberg bw  fairchild hopes to see that rate drop below    percent for graduates of the resilience education program  he told bloomberg bw  although it s too soon to tell the program s success since none of the participating inmates have been released yet  fairchild told bloomberg bw that he doesn t have immediate plans to increase the size of the program beyond the    mba volunteers it now includes  though he d be happy to see other business schools embrace similar efforts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fairchild will deliver a seminar entitled  entrepreneurship education in the prison system  next month in houston as part of darden s ideas to action speakers forum </paragraph>

  <title>smaller paychecks for mbas  not for graduates from top schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a wall street journal article yesterday called into question the value of the mba  suggesting that pay for recent graduates is stagnant or falling while tuition and fees continue to escalate  indeed  tuition rates do seem to be climbing everywhere  but at top tier schools  starting salaries are increasing as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wsj article cited survey results from the graduate management admissions council indicating that median salary for newly minted mbas was flat between      and       the gmac survey included results from more than     mba programs  data collected by clear admit from    of the most elite mba programs in the united states  meanwhile  revealed that at all but three schools  average starting salaries for graduates of the class of      were higher than those for the class of       by between   and    percent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tuition increases  however  are outpacing salary increases at these top schools  total costs   including tuition and fees   rose at all    of the schools from which clear admit collected data between      and       and in almost all cases  the increase in costs was greater than the rise in average starting salary </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wsj article highlighted another important fact about the mba landscape  namely that there has been an explosion in the number of degrees granted in recent years  citing department of education figures  the wsj article reported that the         mbas granted in         by u s  schools represents a    percent jump from a decade earlier  as brooks holtom  a management professor at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  told the wsj   an mba is a club that is now not exclusive  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  just as the number of mba degrees has grown  so  too  has the number of alternatives to the traditional two year mba program  now the graduate management education space is crowded with full time  part time  executive and online mbas  as well as many new specialized masters degree programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these trends together mean that now as never before it is important to consider reputation  accreditation and location among several other key factors before taking the mba plunge </paragraph>

  <title>admissions myths debunked as round two deadline approaches at university of chicago booth school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with its round two deadline coming up tomorrow  january  th  at   p m  chicago time   associate director of admissions joanne legler devoted a recent post on the booth insider blog to debunking some common myths about the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>contrary to what some prospective applicants may think  a campus visit is not a requirement for admissions   while we d love to get everyone who applies to see our campus in person  we realize it s just not possible for everyone to make their way to chicago   legler writes  her team strongly encourages applicants to visit if at all possible  since doing so is one of the best ways to truly get a feel for the school  but those who can t will not be disadvantaged in the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>legler also underscored the fact that chicago booth does not have any minimum gpa or gmat gre requirements  nor does it have a minimum requirement for years of work experience   we really encourage applicants to apply when they are ready   legler writes   that s different for everyone and we see applicants who are successful as early career candidates with two or three years or work experience  as well as more seasoned professionals who decide much later in their careers to apply for the mba  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in short order  legler goes on to upend a few more misconceptions  stating for the record that chicago booth is looking for applicants from all industries  not just finance and consulting backgrounds  that it is possible to be admitted in the third round  though far fewer spots are left by then  so apply sooner if you can   and that you aren t at a disadvantage if you weren t a business major in college     percent of chicago booth students have a liberal arts background  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to letters of recommendation  legler s advice is to resist trying to impress the admissions committee with a letter from someone whose credentials outweigh how well they really know you   work with someone who knows you and your accomplishments  talents and skills well   she advises   your current or former supervisor and a colleague or client who can speak at length about your value to your company or organization is a much better choice than someone who may have an impressive title  but little insight into you as a person or future chicago booth student  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those applicants fortunate enough to be invited to interview after submitting an application tomorrow  there is no advantage or disadvantage to interviewing with one type of interviewer over another  legler promises   regardless of who your interviewer may be  the feedback is used equally in each and every case   and all interviewers   both alumni and staff   have been carefully trained and will approach the interview blind  without having seen your application </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so there you have it  best of luck getting those applications ready for tomorrow s deadline </paragraph>

  <title>should career services staff weigh in on mba admissions decisions  wall street journal consults clear admit for insight</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the wall street journal recently turned to clear admit co founder graham richmond to get his take on a trend taking hold in mba admissions  namely  bringing in career services staff to evaluate candidates as part of the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a wsj article published today reports that admissions staff at several top mba programs  including ucla s anderson school of management  unc s kenan flagler business school and the university of toronto s rotman school of management  have begun to ask career services staff to sit in on committee meetings to help assess how realistic candidates  stated career goals are or otherwise inform the admissions process  schools are increasingly employing this more integrated approach in an effort to help admissions officers better understand which candidates will be more employable come graduation and ultimately boost schools  placement statistics </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for example  at the university of rochester s simon graduate school of business  the director of career services has for the past year and a half been meeting every couple of weeks with the admissions team  sharing information on which firms and industries are recruiting at the school and which types of students have fared best post graduation  at kenan flagler  meanwhile  career services staff now routinely train admissions staff to look for the same traits in prospective applicants that a hiring manager will look for in current students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit s richmond pointed out as part of the wsj article that involving career services staff in this way in the admissions process can benefit applicants  providing a key reality check for them early in the game  but he cautioned that looking too closely at employability and stated goals   that is  looking to only admit candidates who seem to be  sure things  for post mba employment   could lead to a very plain class and or cause applicants to keep riskier post mba plans to themselves </paragraph>
    <paragraph>balance is key when it comes to involving career services staff in the admissions process  richmond advises   having well defined   and feasible   career goals is important in terms of ensuring success in b school and beyond  but i also think that having a diverse class that heads off into dozens of industries and positions is pretty important  too   he says  career services offices can share with admissions that they are good at placing students in certain industries  so that the admissions team looks for applicants whose stated goals include those industries  but admissions officers should also push career services staff to open new doors with recruiters if they notice growing interest in the applicant pool in a new area  richmond offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>read the full wsj article   mba pop quiz  are your employable   and don t miss clear admit s q a series with career services directors at top mba programs  we also feature a line of clear admit school selection guides  which are specifically designed to help applicants understand career specific offerings at the leading mba programs and identify the schools that will best support their career goals </paragraph>

  <title>bloomberg businessweek reports widening wage gap between men and women mba grads</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>female graduates from top mba programs average    cents for every dollar their male classmates earn  down from a high of    cents in       according to new research out this month from bloomberg businessweek  according to the magazine s biennial survey of mba graduates  women earn less than men at about a third of the top u s  business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>female graduates from the class of      at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania  for example  earned    percent of male wages  and those at stanford graduate school of business earned    percent  bloomberg bw reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gap numbers at the beginning can sometimes be accounted for by differences in grades  course selection and the fields male and female graduates choose  according to marianne betrand  an economics professor at university of chicago booth school of business   what is much more striking is how much that gap grows over time   bertrand told bloomberg bw  citing studies on compensation among female booth mba grads </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg bw cited numerous sources revealing that pay disparity between men and women is greatest in the finance sector  for example       census data showed the largest gender pay gaps to be among insurance agents  personal advisors and securities sales agents </paragraph>
    <paragraph>catalyst  a nonprofit organization focused on expanding opportunities for women in business  published research the same year showing that female mbas were paid  on average         less in their first jobs than men  and that the gap widens to         by mid career   women s careers lag behind men from day one   anna beninger  a senior associate in catalyst s research department  told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in part  the pay discrepancies between male and female mba grads also reflect shifts in career choices female mbas are making  women have left the finance sector   where the highest salaries are found   in greater numbers  which drives down average female salaries </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there s a tremendous realization among women mbas that you don t have to march lockstep into banking   janet hanson  ceo of women s networking group    broads  told bloomberg bw   the industry is changing  and i think a lot of people are overwhelmed by the regulatory environment and the uncertainties in the industry  that perhaps makes the risk reward trade off very different   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>career services directors at top schools concur  noting that female mbas are attracted increasingly to the technology  consumer products  consulting and entrepreneurship sectors </paragraph>

  <title>forbes ranks the mba rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a column today  forbes magazine took a collective look at all five of the big mba rankings   its own  as well as those from bloomberg businessweek  the economist  the financial times and u s  news   and compiled the results into a  sort of ranking of the mba rankings  for       for prospective mba applicants looking to make sense of the different rankings  the piece was useful for its succinct summary of the various methodologies each publication employs to arrive at its list </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though  as the article stressed  they are in overly simple terms  the following provides a valuable cheat sheet to remind yourself which ranking measures which attributes of an mba program  and  perhaps by extension  which results are most aligned with what you value most in a program     forbes   does a simple calculation of roi   years out from business school  financial times   bases     of the ranking on post mba salaries   years after graduation  businessweek   emphasizes the satisfaction levels of two core stakeholders  students and recruiters  u s  news   world report   includes a survey of deans and mba directors  and uses gmat scores as part of student selectivity  economist   assesses the ability of the mba to open new career opportunities  as well as the international make up of the school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today s forbes piece stressed a point that those of us here at clear admit like to make whenever we report the most recent rankings from any publication  which is that a school s ranking should never be the most influential factor in your decision of where to attain your mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in compiling its  mba   premiership       rankings  forbes noted the strikingly consistent strong performance of harvard business school  the university of chicago business school  stanford graduate school of business and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania in        with only a couple of exceptions  these four schools fill the first four places in every ranking   read the forbes piece </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the purposes of its mba   premiership rankings  forbes separated schools into four regions   the united states  europe  canada and asia pacific   and calculated overall performance as an average of each schools ranking position across the five rankings </paragraph>

  <title>former chicago booth  wharton admissions director extols virtues of admissions consultants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>rose martinelli  former dean of admissions at the university of chicago booth school of business  shared her thoughts on how admissions consultants can be of great help to applicants in the mba admissions process in a recent column in bloomberg businessweek </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martinelli  who also spent time working in admissions at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  is now a guest contributor to bloomberg bw s getting in blog  in a post last week  she shared her views on the role of admissions consultants  drawing parallels between their services and those of a trusted financial adviser  in particular  she says  admissions consultants can be very useful in helping answer candidates  specific questions about their candidacy and in guiding candidates through the application process   their structured approach as well as knowledge of different programs can provide customized recommendations based on your experience  developmental needs and career aspirations   she wrote  adding that she believes the advisory services offered by admissions consultants to be the most valuable  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martinelli stressed that the process for finding a good   and ethical   admissions consultant should be similar to one you would use to choose a counselor or financial adviser   a level of trust and comfort must exist between the two for you to give your best effort to get the best result   she noted  admissions consultants should not guarantee admission to a particular program  she added  because no one has that power in the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if i had my druthers  applicants would not need consultants   martinelli wrote   but then again  i guess i wouldn t need a financial adviser either  touche  </paragraph>

  <title>columbia business school hosts first women s week</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>earlier this month  columbia business school  cbs  hosted its first women s week  featuring speakers  networking opportunities and gatherings in boston  new delhi and singapore  as well as on cbs s manhattanville campus  sallie krawcheck      former ceo and chair of citi global wealth management  provided the keynote address  women s week  which took place from november   th through   th  was a joint venture of the dean s office  admissions  student affairs and alumni relations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in her address as part of the week s events  krawcheck told assembled students and faculty that she thinks women s careers can be viewed as  lattices instead of ladders   she shared her experiences in business and offered advice for how women can advance their careers while striking a balance between work and home  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>krawcheck  who also is a member of the cbs board of overseers  praised the recent national election for sending a record number of women to the senate   putting more women in government is a smart move   she said  citing research that has shown that compromise is more likely with women involved because they tend to focus more on long term outcomes and relationships </paragraph>
    <paragraph>krawcheck stressed that  women are not better than men  just different   but  she noted  diverse teams regularly best less diverse teams even when their members are less capable  companies should be aware of the deeper differences between male and female employees   including childbirth and nursing   and look at how those differences might impact career paths  for example  women live longer  are often healthier than men  and have real potential to ramp up their careers after children are grown   companies should move toward flexibility without shame  for employees    she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>margaret ryan      president of columbia women in business  cwib   praised the participation by both male and female students in the school s inaugural women s week   i think it was a wonderful way to celebrate the female community at the school while also fostering an open dialogue around the current challenges facing women in business today  </paragraph>

  <title>u s  news article cautions prospective applicants that diversity mba admissions events provide limited advantages</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>following a brouhaha earlier this month surrounding a feature published by bloomberg businessweek about which business schools have the most attractive female students  u s  news   world report today ran a piece about diversity oriented admissions events hosted by schools  participation in these events   which are targeted toward applicants who are women  veterans  lesbian  gay  bisexual or transgender  lgbt  or minorities   can be valuable  but only to a limited degree  the u s  news piece reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>they do offer an opportunity to meet and interact with admissions officials  but they don t necessarily provide an accurate representation of the actual business school experience  nor do they necessarily give participants an advantage in the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph> while these are pitched as a  day in the life   when you get on campus  you won t have that many people from similar backgrounds and will need to effectively build relationships with a much broader group of people   nicole lindsay  who runs the website diversity mba prep  told u s  news  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lindsay also warned against the dangers of prospective mba applicants presuming that their candidacy is stronger because they were invited to such events   these events can lull candidates into a comfort zone that isn t real   she told u s  news </paragraph>
    <paragraph>still  participants do get a chance to see the campus  meet with other prospective applicants  establish relationships with admissions officials and more  and in some instances  schools even foot the bill for room and board or waive application fees for participants  according to u s  news </paragraph>
    <paragraph> for those looking to gain every advantage when applying  these opportunities were something i wish i had known more about when i started the process   prospective mba applicants rachael waddell told u s  news   these weekends have provided so much meat to my applications and have been a determining factor in where i apply  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg businessweek  for its part  conceded that its online poll about which business schools have the most attractive female students and the article conveying the results was in poor taste  particularly given the gender gap that persists in mba cohorts  it issued a statement to the daily dot saying as much and pulled the pieces on november   th </paragraph>

  <title>university of chicago booth school of business  london business school top bloomberg businessweek      rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the university of chicago booth school of business and london business school topped this year s rankings of u s  and international mba programs respectively by bloomberg businessweek  the rankings  released yesterday  employed a methodology shift that resulted in some major shifts for schools toward the bottom of the list but had little impact on the top tier schools  the basic criteria  however  for how schools are judged remains the same at it has been for the past two decades  namely how well they serve their students and recruiters </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among u s  schools  there was no change at the very top  with chicago booth  harvard business school and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school claiming spots one  two and three respectively  as they did in       there was some minor jostling for position among the remaining schools in the top     but the notable shifts were advances by cornell s johnson school of management and carnegie mellon university s tepper school of business and drops by columbia business school  cbs  and uc berkeley s haas school of business  johnson jumped from    in      to   this year  and tepper moved up from    to     haas slid  meanwhile  from   in      to    this year  and cbs likewise fell from   to     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the top    u s  schools according to bloomberg bw s      rankings are as follow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>     chicago booth school of business      harvard business school      wharton school at the university of pennsylvania      stanford graduate school of business      kellogg school of management at northwestern university      fuqua school of business at duke university      johnson school of management at cornell university      ross school of business at the university of michigan at ann arbor      sloan school of management at massachusetts institute of technology     darden school of business at the university of virginia at charlottesville     tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university     tuck school of business at dartmouth college     haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley     columbia business school     kelley school of business at the university of indiana at bloomington</paragraph>
    <paragraph>among international mba programs  there was more movement in the top ranks  london business school jumped several spots  from   in       to knock insead from its      number one position  oxford university s said school sailed up the chart from    to    and spain s iese sidled up from    in      to   this year  even amid continuing employment challenges in that country </paragraph>

  <title>darden school of business admissions director provides video update on application process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>sara neher  dean of admissions at the university of virginia s darden school of business  shared a video this week updating applicants to the school on the admissions process  opportunities to meet with school officials around the globe and more  for round one applicants eagerly awaiting an invitation to interview  you ll want to check out what she has to say </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the round one deadline at darden was october   th  and neher and her team are excitedly reading applications  she shared  invitations to interview are beginning to come out in waves  she continued  her team started with applicants who live in the united states  hoping to give them time to make plans to travel to charlottesville to interview sometime in the second half of november or the first half of december  but she stressed that you shouldn t worry if you haven t already received an invitation to interview because they will continue to be sent out until early december  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her team will focus next on invitations to interview for candidates who will do so remotely via skype or with an alumnus of the school outside of the united states  invitations for interviews away from darden s campus or via skype will begin to go out later this week and continue on a rolling basis for several weeks  neher said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she stressed again that applicants who have not yet been invited to interview should not be concerned   applications are randomly assigned to readers and read in random order  and there are several hundred applications that have not been read yet   she said  round one decisions will be released on december   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>neher herself just returned from mexico city  istanbul  milan  madrid and chicago  perhaps you met up with her at a darden event in one of those cities  faculty will lead a few more events in december  including in moscow  lisbon and tokyo  to learn more about these or other remaining events elsewhere in the world  click here  the school will also soon begin to share information about coffee chats  informal events organized by current students when they travel back to their home countries over the winter break  neher said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in conclusion  she shared some specific information for candidates who are considering applying to darden through the consortium for graduate study in management  the first deadline to do so is november   th  and neher and her team intend to turn around interview invitations very quickly for candidates who apply by then in the hopes that they will be able to come to campus to interview sometime between november   th and december  nd  that way  consortium applicants will be able to interview with other round one applicants and arrive on campus while classes are still in session and students are still in residence  in the event that you are invited to interview as a consortium candidate but cannot make it to campus to interview in that short turnaround time  darden may not be able to get you a decision by december   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that s okay   neher said   there is no negative implication for you  but we want you to be able to see us when there are students in residence and get to know the school in december or november   she continued  so if you apply via the consortium  be on the lookout for an interview invitation right away and be prepared  if possible  to make some travel arrangements pretty quickly to get to charlottesville  she encouraged   view neher s complete video here </paragraph>

    <paragraph>ceibs  which opened    years ago  stepped up its efforts last year to secure a spot among the top tier business schools around the globe  it brought in john quelch  a former administrator at harvard business school and a former dean at london business school  to lead the charge  according to the wsj report  quelch has been trying to draw big name faculty members from elite schools with large salaries and generous perks  believing that outstanding faculty will draw outstanding students  which in turn will attract recruiters and establish a successful alumni body </paragraph>
    <paragraph>henry moon  a professor of organizational behavior who relocated to ceibs from lbs last year  told the wsj that a    percent pay raise  tax breaks  a housing subsidy and funding for his four sons  schooling helped convince him  before quelch called   i had never even heard of ceibs   moon told the wsj </paragraph>
    <paragraph>is quelch s investment in big name faculty paying off  ceibs has  entered the conversation  among applicants to top tier schools  clear admit s richmond told the wsj  but so far it s mostly just talk </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ceibs boasts that its students also apply to the best business schools in europe and the united states  but the wsj article suggests that though this may be true  they don t necessarily gain acceptance  leaving ceibs more of a fallback </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with its lower price tag          for international students and         yuan  or about          for chinese students for the    month mba program  and potential to serve as a gateway to chinese business opportunities  ceibs could still make inroads among applicants to top mba programs  but the wsj article points out that it faces tough competition from an influx of western business schools setting up shop in asia  so whether ceibs will do more than enter the conversation remains to be seen </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business releases class of      profile information</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a post last week to its mba admissions blog  the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  shared statistics on its incoming class of mbas  the class of      revealed some interesting shifts  including an all time high percentage of international students  a return to more typical levels of u s  minority student representation after a spike last year and a slight increase in work experience among incoming students </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there are many reasons for these fluctuations   wrote stanford mba admissions blogger victoria hendel de la o   with our small class size  even two students can  and do  shift a percentage here or there  but the most relevant factor is that our candidate pool is ever changing  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of the     new students who came to campus this year     percent are international students   an all time high   drawn from    countries outside of the united states  u s  minority representation  meanwhile  fell from last year s    year high of    percent to a  more typical level  of    percent   all types of diversity matter at stanford  our outreach efforts will continue to foster students whose unique perspectives will enhance our learning community   hendel de la o noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of students  career and educational backgrounds  the class of      showed only slight shifts   this year  a few more engineers and humanities majors joined the mba program  with a handful fewer students who studied business   hendel de la o wrote  noting that the breadth of undergraduate majors continues to amaze them  the industry mix changed only slightly as well  but the absolute number of schools and organizations represented by the incoming class also topped all previous records  with two thirds of new students the only people to come from their respective organizations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  work experience inched up just a little  from     years last year to     years this year  representing a    year peak </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hendel de la o underscored the fact that stanford admits individuals  not categories   there are no quotas or targets in the admission process  and each applicant is evaluated entirely on his or her own merits  this is why we consider a class profile illustrative  rather than informative   she said </paragraph>
