  <title>best business schools for marketing  part i</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the  four ps   product  price  place and promotion  and the  three cs   customers  competition and company  may not have become completely passe  but there s some serious shifting taking place in the world of marketing  companies must reach global audiences of consumers  confront and master the ever evolving intricacies of social media  command the growing frontier of video marketing and get a handle on terabytes of data representing critical market intelligence waiting to be mined </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  mba students who study marketing can go on to a range of careers brand or product management  market research  sales  advertising  marketing consulting and marketing in retail  pharmaceuticals and high technology  adding further to the complexity is the fact that companies identify and structure their marketing positions in many different ways  some companies have large marketing departments in which individual marketers are assigned to roles specializing in market research  strategy or advertising  other firms expect their marketers to have a hand in and mastery of each of these roles  as well as responsibility for p l  collaboration with supply chain and operations and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  drumroll please  which mba programs are keeping pace with the changing marketing industry  who s doing it best and how  is it through changes to curriculum  strategic faculty hires  launches of new centers and institutes of expertise  unique extracurricular offerings  finally  which schools are helping more of their graduates land the most desirable jobs  whether at consumer product goods  cpg  giants like nike  unilever and pepsico  market research titans like neilsen or forrester or ever increasing data analytics shops like cloudera  sumo logic or google  read on for some of our picks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for almost two decades  northwestern s kellogg school of management has placed among the very top programs in u s  news   world report s annual ranking of best business schools for marketing  of course  all rankings have their flaws  but when the same program tops the list year after year after year  it certainly suggests that kellogg is getting something right </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so just what does kellogg do so well when it comes to marketing  for starters  kellogg s marketing faculty is among the best in the world  professor angela y  lee chairs a department made up of almost    tenure  clinical  affiliated and emeritus faculty members who approach the teaching of marketing from diverse perspectives and backgrounds ranging from psychology and cultural anthropology to neuroscience and data analytics </paragraph>
    <paragraph>professor derek rucker  for example  regularly publishes in the world s leading psychology journals  delving into what makes for effective advertising and what motives underlies consumer consumption  professor florian zettelmeyer  meanwhile  who heads the program on data analytics at kellogg  focuses on evaluating the effects of information technology and big data on firms  kellogg s belief has always been that the best marketing education results from the deepest possible understanding of customer behavior  which it feels is best delivered through a wide array of lenses precisely those offered by its diverse faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph>traditional texts meet cutting edge course offerings even amid seismic shifts in the field of marketing  kellogg professor philip kotler s      textbook  marketing management  has remained a standard text at many american business schools  and kellogg also likes to point out that many of the marketing professors leading rival business school marketing departments in fact hold kellogg phds  but kellogg is also always evolving to keep pace with the discipline s shifting landscape  as an example  a kellogg mba student who chooses to major in marketing can also choose the data analytics pathway  which offers opportunities for deeper dives through courses such as  digital marketing analytics  and  customer analytics  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>every mba who graduates from kellogg will have a foundational understanding of marketing since one of the school s nine core curriculum courses is  marketing management   beyond that  students targeting careers in the field can choose from one of two majors  marketing  which provides an in depth understanding of marketing concepts suitable for careers in management consulting  general management  or other functions or marketing management  which is geared toward students set on post mba careers in which marketing plays a central role  such as brand product management or market research </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students can also choose from more than    related electives  which again is how kellogg can stay current with shifts in the industry and encourage its students to view the field of study through multiple lenses  some recent additions to the course options include  thought partnerships  man plus machine is greater than man or machine   designed to teach students to harness data to understand consumer behavior  and  kraft cpg boot camp   a one day program offered last may that brought students face to face with krat company leaders to talk channel relationships  storytelling  nielsen research and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>strategic markets   customers initiative takes marketing beyond the classroom  in addition to its marketing majors and related pathways  kellogg has also launched four  strategic initiatives  designed to focus on key issues confronting today s senior business leaders  again  believing in an interdisciplinary approach  kellogg developed these strategic initiatives to equip graduates across each of its majors with skillsets that will allow them to make meaningful change whatever industry they enter  one of the four strategic initiatives is the kellogg markets   customers initiative  kmci   the kmci serves as a repository for research and insight designed and curated  to help business leaders create and reinvent markets through greater customer insight and focus   according to the kellogg website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the classroom  there are any number of ways for future marketers to get their brand on at kellogg  including a range of centers that fall under the kmci umbrella  since       kellogg has been home to the center for market leadership  which focuses on helping leading organizations learn how to become more customer oriented in order to drive innovation and growth  each fall  the center hosts an annual marketing leadership summit  which lures marketing gurus from leading companies to pool mindshare while tackling key issues like digital disruption  the future of marketing or as at this past fall s conference how to build culture in the digital era  speakers this past october included jim stengel  the former global marketing officer for procter   gamble  talking about intelligent risk taking  and kathy button bell  chief marketing officer for st  louis based emerson  who shared how the engineering firm partnered with hank green  a popular musician and blogger with a strong presence on youtube  to tell its story to consumers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg marketing students take charge since it s kellogg we re talking about  you have to know the students are involved in a big way  the kellogg marketing club is one of kellogg s largest and most active student organizations  putting on a range of events made possible by the sponsorship of numerous companies interested in recruiting kellogg students  like marketing clubs at other schools  kellogg s student run group brings first  and second year students together to let them help one another through interview prep groups that cover interview etiquette  case questions and ad critiques  the second years also share their summer internship experiences with first years to help them know what to expect and how to prepare </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the club also regularly brings chief marketing officers  brand managers and other senior marketing executives to campus for speaker series and hosts an informal lunch   learn program where students gather to discuss marketing trends  the club also organizes marketing industry treks two  or three day trips to leading brand and retail firms on the east and west coasts and  company shadow days  at the proliferation of cpg firms in the kellogg area  letting students get a first hand feel for what a career in marketing would really look like day to day </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  the club also lets students test their marketing mettle through an annual kellogg marketing competition held each winter  student teams of five are challenged to market a randomly assigned real product to the kellogg community  first presenting a marketing plan to a panel of marketing execs  students and judges and then executing on the plan through marketing campaigns on campus and in the evanston community  a fair is held at the conclusion of the competition  where the teams sell their products from booths  a winning team is crowned based on feedback from a panel of judges as well as the target customers themselves </paragraph>
    <paragraph>show me the jobs</paragraph>
    <paragraph>okay so kellogg does a bang up job of preparing its mba students to be marketers  is that enough to land them the jobs they seek at the end of their two years  employment statistics say yes  in          percent of kellogg graduates took functional roles in marketing  earning a median salary of          with a median signing bonus of         </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to help make this happen  the kellogg marketing club joins forces with the school s career management center  cmc  to provide networking events  recruiting advice and opportunities to meet with top recruiters in the field  last year  firms like general mills  kraft  nike  unilever and pepsico were among the top hirers of kellogg grads </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it feels positively philip k  dick esque to think that from the mid   th century until roughly five to    years into the new millennium  moving images delivered across cathode ray televisions were the medium de rigeur to communicate information to a large audience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>although the advent of google glass and oculus rift suggest that virtual reality  vr  advertising could be just around the corner  think of the possibilities for fabric softening bears    video remains  according to the amsterdam based mbatube  the  medium of today s generation   according to the site   approximately    percent of all internet traffic will be video  by       video has become an essential tool that educational institutions use to  recruit and educate students   right now      percent of frequent internet users watch video online   according to mbatube  for business schools  however  there has been a noticeable gap in the marketplace for an  exclusive video platform  that enables them to engage prospective mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>founded by dutch academic marketing advisor and leiden university mba alum rick rudolph  mbatube  according to its bio  is the  only official video portal  on the world wide web where  leading business schools can showcase their mba programs via video   mbatube  bridges the social gap between educational institutions and prospective students  by hosting official  promotional  testimonial and lecture content  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the platform is user friendly and  most importantly  free to use  business schools generate mbatube profiles to which they  upload videos and information to be hosted on the site   institutions that sign up for mbatube have increased opportunities to boost targeted views  increase website traffic  improve seo and reach a  diverse global target audience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>participating schools include </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mbatube allows participating business schools to  access real time analytics on videos  so they can  see how users react to  their  videos  and  get in touch with users who liked  shared  rated  commented or added videos to their playlist   according to the site </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to mbatube s   k  fb followers and  k  twitter followers  the site generates   k  views per month with an    minute average stick ratio   the average age of visitors breaks down as follows </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and the breakdown by country  according to the site </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective post grads tend to undertake thorough research into potential programs so they can make informed decisions about which school will offer the biggest bang for their buck  mbatube posits on its site that business students in particular tend to  engage with institutional admissions staff and pose critical questions before embarking on their program of choice  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mbatube allows prospective students to  compare hundreds of mba programs   view promos  testimonials  and lecture videos  create playlists  perform global searches for all matching mba programs  and share videos with their social media network </paragraph>

  <title>forte announces new self paced mba admissions prep program for women targeting fall      enrollment</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>building on the success of its mbalaunch program a series of targeted webinars and other resources designed to help prospective mba applicants successfully navigate the admissions process the forte foundation has just announced the debut of mbalaunch on demand  based around the same in depth webinars that make up the popular mbalaunch program  this new format will give participating women the flexibility to work at their own pace  applicants who choose to participate in mbalaunch on demand can be ready to apply for the mba by fall      or spring      ideally gaining admission for fall      enrollment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>forte s traditional mbalaunch program is designed for women who are still more than a year out from applying to business school  and its application deadlines and schedule are organized with this in mind  but in spring       forte found that there was a group of pre mba women who were interested in applying for the mba that fall but had missed the mbalaunch application deadlines   there were women who made the decision to pursue an mba later in the cycle and women who hadn t heard of the mbalaunch program during our application deadline timeframe  september to november    explains krystal brooks  who heads the mbalaunch program at forte </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we designed mbalaunch on demand to serve these women to provide them with a structured roadmap to help them build their strongest mba application   she continues   since then  we ve seen very successful candidates move through the program in this self paced  virtual format  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new program offers greater international reach the virtual  self paced design of mbalaunch on demand also makes it accessible to women all over the world  in contrast to the mbalaunch live option  which includes a day long educational and networking event  an assigned peer networking group and a formalized advising program that are based out of a range of u s  cities as well as toronto and london   we want to make the amazing content and resources available to women who aren t able to participate in the in person program   brooks says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that content includes    webinars devoted to gmat prep     webinars on application prep  gmat homework and study plans and an mba application preparation guide  the webinars include speakers from a range of test prep firms and admissions consultants  as well as the graduate management admission council and forte s    member schools  natalie neilson  who took part in the live format mbalaunch program this past year  sees the diversity of content as a major advantage of the program   it s great that they have so many in house gmat resources   she says   for example  on tuesday we would have sentence correction with kaplan  on thursday  reading comprehension with veritas prep  instead of me taking a course from one of these providers  i got to learn tips and tricks from all of them    read a full account of neilson s experience as an mbalauncher here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on demand option is not an overnight cram session forte recommends that women who elect the on demand format still allow ample time to complete the program   in general  we recommend setting aside three months for our gmat prep and another three months for our application prep   reads its website </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the on demand program is perfectly suited for candidates who are self motivated and disciplined but want a timeline and a structure to keep them on track   brooks says   of course  if candidates don t complete homework assignments or listen to webinars  the program is not effective  this is a structured program that calls for candidates to dedicate time to gmat study  self reflection and application preparation   the on demand program also offers participants a cost savings over the live version  though brooks is quick to point out that both are resource intensive and highly subsidized by forte s sponsors and program partners  the cost for participants in the live program is       the on demand program costs        the on demand program is offered at a discount because it doesn t include the same in person events that the in person launch includes   says brooks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>women who choose mbalaunch on demand do miss out on the community of peers formed as part of the live mbalaunch program   the community of peers is certainly a benefit to the in person program   brooks notes   that said  launchers in the on demand program can take advantage of our linkedin group to connect with other women in the program to network and support one another  our staff is also very happy to support and encourage on demand launchers and answer questions as they arise  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t miss forte virtual forum tomorrow in addition  forte also offers a range of other ways for women to develop community with fellow women who are navigating or just considering the mba application process  its forte forum series multi school recruiting events that include panels made up of current mba students and alumnae take place in more than a dozen cities each august and september  and tomorrow  april  th  forte will also be hosting a virtual forum for candidates to connect with its    sponsor schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i would also encourage all pre mba women to activate their free forte professional membership at fortefoundation org join   says brooks  doing so will keep women in the loop on these and other programs and resources forte offers </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  so you want to live in a french villa for business school </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a few weeks back in this space we included tips from a harvard business school  hbs  student on where to live on campus  this week  an insead mba student shares her dream of living in a french villa for business school and how she made it come true </paragraph>
    <paragraph>much like insead itself  the villa sounds like an international melting pot  home to    students speaking    different languages  as you might expect  fontainebleau offers a range of accommodations for insead students  but snagging a villa or chateau takes a little more work  have no fear  in the post that follows insead december     mba student winnie van tells you exactly what steps to follow  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  the  insead mba experience  student blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>friday from the frontline  so you want to live in a french villa for business school  by winnie van</paragraph>
    <paragraph>je suis arrive   fontainebleau  actually  i arrived a little over a month ago  but my new life at insead has flown by faster than a new york minute  it s only now that i have finally found a moment to stop and reflect on it all  so here goes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>let me invite you into my new home villa vivante </paragraph>
    <paragraph>villa vivante is an   th century home with eleven bedrooms  almost as many bathrooms  and two living rooms and kitchens  there are    of us fresh faced mba students living here at the moment  between us  we speak over    languages and come from all corners of the globe specifically from australia  me   america jordan  germany  france  canada  georgia  brazil  belgium  india and japan </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like many of my insead peers  i had my heart set on living in a nearby chateau or villa shared with other classmates  sounds ridiculous i know  but when else will we get the chance to live in a chateau in the french countryside  and when else will we get the chance to live under the same roof with ten other intelligent  fun  multi lingual and overachieving young professionals from ten different countries  for me  this is a once in a life opportunity that makes the insead mba experience truly unique </paragraph>
    <paragraph>accommodation was the first thing that i organized after i got accepted to insead  having applied in the second application round   and i highly recommend incoming candidates do the same  there are plenty of accommodation options in fontainebleau  but if you want to stay in a large shared house or chateau  then supply is limited </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it was a bit tricky finding information on shared housing options  so below is a short list of where some of my december     classmates are living to give you some guidance  in no particular order   bonne chance </paragraph>
    <paragraph>houses next to campus  within    min walking distance  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>club    maison royale marcel lods  separate apartments with some shared common areas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>houses near campus  within    min walking distance  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>villa vivante villa foch le parc</paragraph>
    <paragraph>houses   chateaus further from campus  within driving distance to campus  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chateau fleury chateau de montmelian chateau de courances shangri la le puits carre</paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan school s new logo results in lawsuit</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>cambridge  ma  knight ridder  earlier this week  the mit sloan school of management unveiled a new logo designed to bring the school s  mit brand  to the fore   after extensive study and collaborative effort  the logo was designed to reflect the smart  open  grounded and inventive nature of the school   read an official statement from the school   one of the distinguishing ways that mit stands apart from its peer schools is through our relationship with the institute a world class research institution  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>within hours of the new logo s debut  a lawsuit was filed by the letter  i   in a tersely worded statement  the letter  i  explained   i ve essentially been airbrushed out of the picture here  since when is  institute  less important than  massachusetts  or  technology   to put it bluntly  those words are simply meaningless without me  as if that s not insult enough  the fading  back to the future style memory of me is barely standing upright in this logo  what  am i drunk  let me be very clear here actually  no let me be highly opaque  </paragraph>

  <title>dare to share  mbas and the sharing economy</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>from ride sharing services like uber to fashion websites like rent the runway  it should come as no surprise that these so called  sharing economy  companies are changing the face of business  of course  when business changes  so does business education  in today s changing world  understanding the sharing economy and how to best use it could be key for new mbas as they navigate the workplace </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is the sharing economy  it is no coincidence that the growth of the sharing economy platforms that allow people to  collaboratively consume  by sharing goods and services is occurring as the number of millennials in the workforce increases  just as the economic recession of the     s resulted in a millennial push toward social entrepreneurship careers  those who grew up and attended school during this recession similarly adapted to a more socially conscious form of consumption </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the recent boom in the sharing economy is an understandable result of the millennial focus on minimizing waste and lowering costs  although the rise in the sharing economy is recent with services now allowing consumers to share anything from houses to musical instruments the instinct for humans to share has existed since primitive times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today  being a part of the sharing economy can serve a number of important purposes for a millennial  it can make services more affordable  such as the cost of an airbnb as opposed to a hotel  it can present an opportunity to earn extra income  such as selling goods through etsy  and it can reduce waste by facilitating secondhand purchases </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how will the sharing economy affect today s mbas  even though the idea of the sharing economy seemed preposterous    years ago  it is clear that the idea has caught on and will continue to grow  and interest is growing not only among consumers but among up and coming professionals as well  in a survey by businessbecause com     percent of surveyed mbas said they were interested in working for a sharing economy company </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an ever growing tech industry that sometimes seems to outpace itself  this forward looking interest from mbas is important  in the same survey     percent of mbas said that uber was likely to still exist in       whereas popular tech companies like instagram and facebook were    percent and    percent likely to exist  respectively  the long standing investment firm goldman sachs was only given a    percent likelihood of survival </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not only are mba students increasingly interested in sharing economy companies  but these companies are also hiring mbas at a growing rate  in australia  uber is even working alongside faculty at the australian graduate school of management to identify talented up and comers to join their team  the ride share app is expanding rapidly across the globe and has become a top recruiter for schools such as hec paris and insead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  knowledge is one more thing that can be shared within this new economy  and that means that today s mbas don t just have more opportunities to work for other people  they also have more opportunity to work for themselves  new services allow businesses to hire contractors in a freelance capacity  meaning students can make money from what they know without even leaving their living room </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sites like hourlynerd  which was established by a harvard business school mba  has a network of more than        freelance consultants     percent of whom have an mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how will the sharing economy affect business  it s understandable that the first critics of ride share services like uber were traditional taxi companies  even if the company claims its intention is not to completely overhaul the taxi industry  it s unavoidable that these new services will have a broad impact in the field  as products are more easily shareable  supply increases more rapidly than demand  causing prices to fall </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since it doesn t seem that the sharing economy is going away  it is important for companies to adapt and grow accordingly  and hiring millennials who understand the benefits of the sharing economy is just one way to stay ahead  companies should consider how to make their own products more shareable and see if they can join the sharing economy  rather than rebuke it  businesses might also consider finding ways to partner with sharing economy companies to benefit their product  such as ford s      partnership with zipcar </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is clear that many users find numerous benefits to being a part of the sharing economy  and while this shift in need may be worrisome as new graduates join the workforce  it s important for companies to consider why and what about the sharing economy is appealing to consumers  now more than ever  companies will need to hire young mbas who can help a business stay ahead of the curve of consumer interest  rather than fall behind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how is the sharing economy changing business education  with the growth of the global sharing economy valued in      at     billion and the concern it is bringing to some industries  understanding how and why sharing works is an increasingly important skill for mbas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some schools have even adapted their curriculum with this in mind  last year  the u k  s sharing economy trade body  seuk  announced a partnership with the skoll centre for social entrepreneurship at oxford university s said business school  together  seuk and oxford aim to develop the world s first  trustmark  for the sharing economy  laying down best practices and standards for sharing economy companies and consumers  u k business secretary sajid javid even commented on the sharing economy s vast potential to create new jobs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the united states  research on the sharing economy and its impacts is still divided  while the industry s growth is irrefutable  concerns like accessibility and the negative effects on existing industries are still real concerns  nevertheless  the partnership between oxford and seuk is an important step forward  especially as more mba programs face the question of how to adapt to this changing economy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in order for both consumers and companies to benefit most from this changing world  such partnerships are imperative to success  not only do today s mbas stand to benefit from the growth of the sharing economy  but companies stand to benefit greatly from these students  who possess a unique combination of yesterday s know how and today s ambition </paragraph>

  <title>integrated reasoning tip  more integral than you think</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the newest section of the gmat  the integrated reasoning  is often discounted by students as  less important  that the bigger beasts of the exam  the verbal and quantitative sections  but many mba programs have become more familiar with what the integrated reasoning examines and more than half of programs  particularly those that accept only   th percentile and higher students  are more closely evaluating the integrated reasoning as an indicator of applicant performance  the bottom line is that if you are looking to apply to a top tier school  then all components of the gmat are important </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what tends to be the biggest hurdle for students surrounding the integrated reasoning section is having a reasoning understanding what it covers  what the questions look like  and a few basic tips that lead to success </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the integrated reasoning section shows up after the awa and like the awa is    minutes in length  test takers are given    questions which can appear in one of four formats </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many of the questions can be multi part  with no partial credit given   a key  important point that many test takers do not recognize  that can make scoring well on the section difficult  considering the short amount of time given and the complexity of the problems </paragraph>
    <paragraph>however  there are some great advantages to the integrated reasoning section  it is not computer adaptive  unlike the quantitative and verbal sections of the exam  and is scored between a      meaning there is some room for error with the possibility of scoring a perfect   score </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the big key with the integrated reasoning section is to take full stock in how it can impact the rest of your exam  situated immediately after the awa means that walking away from the integrated reasoning unsteady can translate into a rocky start for more challenge computer adaptive components of the quantitative and verbal sections  when it is immensely important to feel decisive about problem set up and selection of answer choices </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a few tips for how test takers can prepare yourself for the integrated reasoning section  and some additional tips for success </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t fall into the trap discounting the integrated reasoning   consider it an integral part of your study plan </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the above gmat tip comes from veritas prep  since its founding in       veritas prep has helped more than         students prepare for the gmat and offers the most highly rated gmat prep course in the industry </paragraph>

  <title>admissions director reveals record darden round   results  encourages round   applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>sara neher  who heads admissions for the university of virginia s darden school of business  took to her video blog a few weeks ago to share details about round   results  talk about round    which was then still underway  and encourage applicants considering round   to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are very excited about those of you who have paid a deposit and decided to come to darden   she said in the february   th post  the group is very diverse  she continued  including students from chile to china  indonesia to finland and all over the united states </paragraph>
    <paragraph>record darden round   results in terms of women choosing to come to charlottesville she also shared that the group that had committed so far as part of round   was    percent women  bearing in mind that later rounds could cause that number to shift up or down  it is well above last year s entering class  which was    percent female  in a conversation with clear admit last summer  neher indicated that improving gender equity in the mba class and diversity in general was an important goal of hers  but that change had come slower than she hoped   we couldn t be more excited about all of those things and hope that those of you applying in round   will want to join them   she said in the post sharing the round   results </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the weeks since neher s post  hundreds of applicants have flocked to mba livewire to share their fate as part of round    consortium applicants began reporting offers of admission in early march  followed by a flood of acceptances last tuesday and wednesday  for those who are curious  here s a little of what livewire data told us about those who shared their darden round   admissions decisions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those who shared round   admissions decisions via livewire  the average reported gpa for those accepted was      and the average gmat was      those waitlisted reported the exact same average gmat score       but a slightly lower average gpa        those who didn t get in had a lower average gmat score       but the average gpa for rejected round   applicants  at       was actually very close to the average for those who gained admission and higher than the average for those placed on the waitlist  that some of these stats were so close across groups certainly suggests that other elements of the application process essay  interview  recommendations play a significant role in determining who makes the final cut </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because livewire data is subject to selection bias meaning that those who get in are far more likely to share the news than those who don t admission rates can be misleading  but it is worth noting that students reporting acceptances outnumbered those who were waitlisted by a factor of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>acceptances and scholarship money still to come in round   it s also not too late to apply in round   darden s final deadline is friday  april  th   i expect we ll have more scholarship funding available for round   than we have in the past  so i encourage you to apply i you are still trying to decide   neher said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also reminded applicants that darden provides feedback to those who don t get in   at darden  we give everybody personalized feedback over skype or the phone   she says   so if the worst happens and you don t get in you actually will still get feedback from an admissions committee member about how to improve your application for the following year  </paragraph>

  <title>hbs mba executive director weighs in on hiring of new gatekeeper</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  yesterday announced chad losee  hbs mba      as the next managing director of mba admissions and financial aid succeeding dee leopold  who has held the position since      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make sure to check out our initial coverage from yesterday for information on losee s credentials and background </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to learn more about losee and harvard s decision to select him as leopold s successor  we spoke with jana kierstead  executive director of hbs s mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  dee leopold has done such a wonderful job with the mba admissions process at hbs  building a reputation for innovation  transparency and fairness in mba admissions over the course of her    years in the role  in light of that  was there a particular strategy that you employed in conducting the search for her replacement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   we certainly used those tenants as part of the process  we conducted an open search and there were over     candidates involved  we hoped the next candidate would embody those qualities  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she then followed  saying that losee does possess these qualities and that his experiences as an hbs student would only lead to further improvements for applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for future candidates who fear that the admissions process will return to the opaqueness of pre leopold days  before she changed the game with her transparency and direct communication for now  such fears seem unfounded </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  how important was hiring an hbs mba for the role   was that a prerequisite for the job   it seems to have traditionally been the case </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   while this was discussed it was in no way a requirement  we spoke to many non hbs mbas  as a former hbs student   losee  has the ability to know the program and speak to the experience of what it is like to be a graduate  we know that he is passionate about hbs and business education  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it should come as no surprise that hbs chose to hire an alum for this position  as the insider knowledge of the admissions process certainly has its advantages  at the very least  hiring someone who is already familiar with the admissions process shortens the learning curve in managing the process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  given the length of leopold s career at hbs  how important was longevity  the likelihood that the person would stick around for the long term  as you contemplated hiring for this position </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   this was not necessarily something we looked for  but you always hope that when you find someone talented they will stay  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when we mentioned losee s age as part of the rationale behind this question  kierstead commented that while age in no way played a part in their assessment or served as a requirement for the position  his experience as a recent graduate certainly holds value in that he possesses knowledge on the current state of the admissions financial aid process  which will serve him in practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>his experience as an observer on the admissions board also grants him unique insight into the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  with leopold remaining part of the admissions team at hbs  in what capacity will she will she be assisting with the transition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   she will be involved in the transition as needed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she added that while leopold will be there if they need her  the training process and support will be primarily provided by a team of five senior staff members in the mba admissions and financial aid office </paragraph>
    <paragraph>given the stability in hbs  admissions office  the transition looks to be a smooth one  especially with leopold providing support </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  losee has been at bain   co since       has he remained active with harvard in any way over the last two years since he returned to bain </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   yes  he sat on the alumni board  which is a group of    alumni who help advise the school  dean and alumni body  he was also involved in recruiting hbs students for bain  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  other than losee s work with hbx and bain  were than any specific accomplishments of his that elevated him above the other candidates for the director of mba admissions position </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jana kierstead   i wouldn t say that it was any specific accomplishments  as much as specific qualities and characteristics  he has exceptional interpersonal skills  he is transparent and exudes confidence  which will serve him well in this position  he has excellent analytic and strategic skills  and he has a deep understanding of harvard s pedagogy  as demonstrated by his work developing the disruptive learning course with clayton christensen  hbs professor   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while it is unlikely to see any noticeable changes immediately  we are excited to see where losee takes things and how hbs continues to evolve the admissions process </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  a recent hbs alumna reflects on her business school experience</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the paths that people follow to business school can be remarkably diverse as can those they follow once they re done  mallory dwinal s interesting course to harvard business school  hbs  and beyond caught our attention  the recent hbs alumna  pictured above  far left  wound her way to the boston business school only after picking up a phd in education from the university of oxford and working for teach for america as a middle and high school spanish teacher at a charter school in washington  dc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the former rhodes scholar is now hard at work founding a school of her own oxford day academy a proposed public charter high school for the sequoia union high school district of san mateo county  california   slated to open in fall       its mission is to engage and develop intelligent  empathetic young leaders with the character  ability  and passion they need to create positive change in the world   her linkedin profile states </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students at oxford day will spend half of each school day in their local communities completing real world electives and internships  using oxford style tutorials  the school s teachers will help the students apply personalized academics to social issues that they care about   through this approach  our young people will develop not only deep content mastery  but also the open ended problem solving and interpersonal communication skills required to become impactful leaders for positive social change  both at home and around the globe   reads dwinal s profile  pretty cool  we think  our thanks to dwinal for letting us share her reflections on her time at hbs with clear admit s readers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   mba voices   the hbs student blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by mallory dwinal</paragraph>
    <paragraph>rc year is a lot more work than people are willing to admit  there s a ton of new material to cover and exercises to complete  especially during the first term  it s interesting and     percent manageable  but i didn t know to expect it and wasted a lot of time feeling like i was behind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make ec year work for you  and take the risks you want to take  there are tons of resources  financial and otherwise  to help you explore your interests find them and take advantage  i was trying to pull together financial and political support to open a new kind of charter high school in california  and hbs was very generous  from grants to covering plane tickets  to independent project  ip  credit for designing the school  they made it possible for me to chase that dream  they want to help  so reach out and advocate for yourself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the people from my class        who seem happiest with their time at hbs are the ones who were deliberate about prioritizing what was important to them and occasionally saying  no   you spend hours every day in open discussion with people you will still meet colleagues and make friends if you skip some parties  clubs  and networking events </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i wish i d let go of the guilt i felt about not going to every single social event  big  loud events were never my thing but i often felt like i was passing up an important part of business school  now  on the other side of hbs  i m very happy with the choices i made  and wish i would have owned them from the beginning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t be afraid to get off the beaten track  for family reasons  i split my time in rural areas between illinois and kentucky and did research remotely for an education non profit in new york  i also worked on school start up funding on the side  grants from harvard university paid for all of that work  there is no prescription for careers outside of consulting  banking  and a few other traditional business school fields  let yourself enjoy that flexibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i realized that i would probably never be happy working    in a routine role or    outside of k    education  this realization came through reflection over the course of two years of case discussions  simulations  and summer work  i ll be forever grateful for that opportunity to better know myself  clarity about the field you want to be in and the daily lifestyle you want from it is half the battle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the people are down to earth and caring in ways i never could have imagined  my dad passed away a few weeks after graduation  and the outpouring of love and support was indescribable  it s easy to get caught up in insecurities about how successful everyone there is  but you soon find they re also some of the most generous and compassionate people you ll ever meet </paragraph>

  <title>how nawmba supports businesswomen today</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this article originally appeared in its entirety on metromba com</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the national association of women mbas  nawmba  was founded in       and the organization has supported the education and professional development of many women since that time  with student and professional chapters of the organization located in regions all across the united states  nawmba has a large network of members dedicated to supporting female business professionals  to learn more about nawmba  i spoke with executive director virginia myers  who shared information about the organization s current offerings  as well as the exciting plans for future developments </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nawmba is a big supporter of educational opportunities  and the organization offers many webinars for professional development  some webinars are geared toward current mba students  whereas others are more suited to those who have already obtained an mba  this helps professionals continue their education after business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition  nawmba offers many professional development events throughout the year  for instance  chapters may host local and regional events to help provide leadership and networking opportunities for its members  and when a new chapter is established  the professional launch event brings together prominent businesswomen  corporate sponsors  and new members for great networking opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>furthermore  the yearly conference   career fair features high caliber speakers  networking opportunities  and a career fair with exhibitors from a variety of industries  the event takes place in a different city each year  most recently houston and the washington d c  metro area   which gives members the opportunity to network with women outside of their specific geographic location </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nawmba also provides the resources for women to further their professional education and meet with potential employers  the ability to interact with fellow members and other professional women may be the biggest benefit of joining nawmba </paragraph>
    <paragraph> most of what it provides is through networking with other successful women and professional development   said myers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>myers revealed that nawmba has exciting plans for a mentorship program in which both the mentor and mentee benefit from interaction </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the key thing i m interested in is to find a way for young people to also provide value to people who are mentors   said myers  the mentees could provide information about millennials  for instance  or offer insight into new technologies  furthermore  the mentors can act as a  personal board of advisors  to the younger women who are navigating different career phases </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nawmba s pilot program will ensure both parties benefit from a mutual flow of information  and that the mentees feel like they are also bringing something to the conversation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>myers discussed what skills mbas should master in order to stand out in the job market </paragraph>
    <paragraph> obviously  a lot of things vary in technical skills based on what your role is  but a few things are vital  regardless of what you re doing  being able to work cross culturally  as the world becomes smaller and economies more global  is important   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also stressed the importance of being able to communicate effectively with people from different backgrounds  whether that person is from a different country  socio economic status  or even industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph> clear communication and being able to read people are vital   said myers  who noted that emotional intelligence  ei  skills are necessary in today s market  although electronic communication is the norm  more traditional means of reaching out are also critical skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph> communication is more electronic  true  but an important skill is often left on the table  where people need to be able to pick up the phone or write an actual paper thank you letter  a lot of people have social anxiety about interfacing with people in person  these are skills that can make people stand out in person regardless of industry   said myers  these people skills can be improved in sociable organizations such as nawmba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because nawmba is a relatively small organization  it is able to add programs quickly to meet market demand  the organization is implementing a lot of new and different programs in the near future  a revamped website is set to debut very soon  which will provide existing and future members access to helpful content  lastly  myers is planning to launch a podcast series to interview successful women about how they got where they are and their stories in general  overall  nawmba will continue to evolve and support the dynamic women who are leaders  entrepreneurs  and business executives </paragraph>

  <title>best business schools for social impact  part ii</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>on friday  we began our coverage of the rise of social impact among mba students and programs with a look at efforts underway at the yale school of management and nyu stern school of business  today  we continue our focus  looking at the countless social impact initiatives in progress at uc berkeley s haas school of business  sustainability measures harvard business school is implementing on its own campus  career resources for students seeking social impact roles at oxford university s said school of business and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas a heavy hitter in social impact arena the list of social impact initiatives at uc berkeley s haas school of business is long  the school s institute for business   social impact  ibsi   led by laura d andrea tyson  serves as an overarching hub for an array of programs and centers focused on finding creative solutions to some of the most challenging issues facing society and the environment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one  the center for social sector leadership  cssl   provides a wealth of resources for mba students looking to become leaders in nonprofit and public institutions  on campus  cssl initiatives include social sector solutions  s    which lets haas mba students hone their skills while providing valuable assistance as consultants to organizations in the nonprofit  public and social enterprise sectors  and haas board fellows  which gives students the valuable experience of serving on nonprofit boards </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an effort to provide social impact practitioners in the field with access to the same high quality leadership training afforded to haas mbas  cssl last year launched a first of its kind global initiative providing free online courses covering the foundations of what it takes to make a significant social impact  called philanthropy university  it features a unique curriculum developed and taught by haas faculty as well as industry leaders from mckinsey  hewlett  kiva and others  its seven foundational courses which cover topics including nonprofit strategy  global social enterprise and how to scale social impact  among others are available  for free  to individuals working in the very organizations where those skills are most crucial </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the institute for business   social impact is also home to the center for responsible business  crb   calling itself an  action tank   the crb is designed to unite students  faculty and the heads of companies to redefine business in ways that ensure a sustainable future  one of its most recent developments  the launch late last year of a human rights and business initiative combining coursework and outreach designed to help companies devise their own human rights strategies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the haas social impact fellows program  also launched last year  brings leading experts in the field to campus to mentor students  serve on panels and share their expertise with the school s programs  centers and faculty  among this year s seven fellows are marianne barner  a children s rights champion who for two decades worked to eradicate child labor in ikea s supply chain  paula goldman  global head of impact investing at omidyar network  which seeks to advance the impact investing industry  and jorge m  calderon  founder and managing director of premier impact management and investment consulting firm impact strategy advisors  isa  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and in less two weeks  haas will host its annual global social ventures competition  gsvc   taking place this year in thailand on april  st and  nd  gsvc is a unique competition founded by haas mba students in      that brings together teams from around the globe to learn how to scale their ideas for addressing some of the greatest social impact challenges of our day  thirteen leading business schools from the united states  europe  asia  africa and south america take part  and last year the competition drew     entries from almost    countries  successful social ventures such as kiva  revolution foods and ethos water got their start as part of the gsvc  this year s finalists range from u s  venture providing project management and financing for renewable energy projects in under served communities internationally to a taiwanese organization helping the elderly fight loneliness   sustainability starts at home at hbs harvard business school  hbs  claims to have pioneered the concept of social enterprise with the launch of its social enterprise initiative  sei  in       indeed  its more than    faculty members engaged in social enterprise and teaching have created more than     case studies on social enterprise that have been used to teach hbs mba students as well as mba students at other business schools around the globe  the sei s courses  cases and research center around two main pillars  nonprofit strategy and government and business for social impact  hbs students can choose from electives such as  entrepreneurship in the social sector  or  managing global health  and field courses including  social impact investing  and  social innovation lab   students lead the annual social enterprise conference  secon   which has grown since its launch in      to be one of the most popular conferences on campus  drawing hundreds of students  alumni and experts from the field  the school s new venture competition  nvc  also features a social entrepreneurship track  and teams in this track have made up a third or more of all entrants in recent years  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to the ever growing offerings within the sei  the school is also taking significant strides to ensure that it is incorporating sustainability into its own operations  by operating healthier  more energy efficient buildings  the business school has cut emissions on its campus by    percent and energy use by    percent  it has also implemented single stream recycling  composting in dining halls  reuse collection stations during move out and donation of leftover food to local shelters and food banks  as part of an mba student sustainability associates  ssa  program     first year hbs students contribute to ongoing initiatives and help educate their fellow classmates on the work being done and the ways they can play a role  and last spring  hbs brought composting to its commencement exercises for the first time ever </paragraph>
    <paragraph>social impact s global reach growing interest in social impact extends well beyond the business schools of the united states  in the united kingdom  oxford s said school of business reports that more than a third of its mba students are actively involved with social impact events at the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the skoll centre for social entrepreneurship at said provides a range of innovative social entrepreneurship electives designed to foster whole new approaches to social impact ones that extend well beyond any current regulatory requirements  one course   social entrepreneurship   innovation   looks at the subject matter through an international lens  another   social enterprise design   digs deep to understand the design and development aspects of social ventures </paragraph>
    <paragraph>said mba students can also take part in unique social impact projects  students can choose between the entrepreneurship project or the strategic consulting project  in the first  they are challenged to develop a business plan for a new venture providing a practical approach to addressing a real social issue  as part of the second  students work in teams of four as part of an eight week consultancy project over the summer  working with a range of organizations around the globe that the skoll centre identifies as worthwhile enterprises to benefit from the help provided by the mba student consultants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school also provides valuable resources to students looking to pursue social impact careers beyond graduation  last month  the skoll centre and the said careers centre teamed up to put on the fourth annual social impact careers conference  launch  thirty high impact speakers including penny fowler  head of the private sector team for oxfam  simon abrams  ey senior manager for climate change and sustainability services  and baljeet sandhu  founding director of migrant and refugee children s legal unit shared the varied paths they took to enter the social impact sector  the conference also included panels  workshops and career discussions designed to help interested students understand the less conventional recruiting processes used by some social impact organizations  as well as ways to make an impact in more traditional organizations  including multinational companies  government organizations and financial service providers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> launch aspires to help those seeking fulfilling  meaningful careers by exposing them to opportunities to listen to and learn from those currently pursuing positions in purpose led companies and enterprises   skoll center director pamela hartigan said in a statement   it s so refreshing to see so many organizations recognizing the valuable contributions mba students can make  especially as many mba students internationally are looking for careers which include creating positive social impact  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wave of the future  to save the future to be sure  the programs highlighted here are by no means a complete list of business schools infusing social impact and sustainability into their graduate management education  unc s kenan flagler school of business features a well regarded sustainability concentration  duke university s fuqua school of business offers students the opportunity to concentrate in social enterpreneurship and take part in multiple programs through its center for social entrepreneurship  case   and stanford graduate school of business is home to the center for social innovation  which brings together more than    faculty members who teach a wide ranging social innovation curriculum </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our recent profile of mit sloan alumnus omar mitchell showed how he s putting his mba to use to green the national hockey league  tuck mba students sat front and center at the december cop   paris climate summit  bringing what they d learned back to classmates in hanover  and the university of michigan s ross school of business boasts no fewer than     ways its mba students can make a social impact  from serving on its center for social impact student advisory board to taking part in the sanger leadership center impact challenge  designed to help support profitable ventures with social missions to serve the city of detroit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>student entrepreneurs  too  are increasingly focused on social impact  at northwestern s kellogg school of business  the zell fellows program which provides support to mba students who are trying to get ventures off the ground by graduation this year features multiple businesses with very strong social missions  as well as its first ever nonprofit  professor david schonthal  who heads the zell fellows program  also teaches the  discover  portion of the school s new venture creation track  a course in which students bring problems into the classroom that they are passionate about solving   having taught this class to i don t know how many groups of     students over the past four years  more and more every year and every quarter these problems trend toward things with high degrees of social mission  impact  community orientation   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for as long as social issues challenge our countries and our planet  we trust and expect that business schools and the mba students they teach will continue to rise to the challenge  responding with new and ever more innovative ways to confront and solve them </paragraph>

  <title>social impact and the mba  business schools where the two are synonymous</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph> oh  god yes   replied stacey rudnick when asked if interest in social impact is on the rise among the mba students she counsels  rudnick leads career services for the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin  but her emphatic reply is a standard refrain at any number of leading business schools when asked the same question </paragraph>
    <paragraph>student participation in mccomb s annual  business for good summit   held each february  has been steadily growing  rudnick shares  as has net impact chapter membership and overall career interest in social impact   and the higher interest is not just in non profits   rudnick says   students want to know  what is the ethos of the business that i am considering being a part of  is this a company that is doing good in the world  can i feel good about wearing its logo and its brand as a reflection of my brand   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the idea that the mba can prepare you not only to do well but also to do good has taken hold around the world in a big way  net impact  a nonprofit membership organization formed in      by a small group of socially minded mba students in san francisco has ballooned into an international organization of more than        members  boasting more than     chapters spread across business schools  undergraduate institutions and corporations  net impact s       business as unusual  social and environmental guide to graduate programs found that    percent of mba students surveyed cited learning about social and environmental business as a priority  sixty seven percent agreed or strongly agreed that their mba programs offered adequate career preparation resources for impact job seekers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why this increased demand for social impact focus among mbas  part of it is generational  as mccombs  rudnick points out   you have a generation of students that have been taught from a very young age about consciousness of the environment  energy savings  recycling  taking care of the planet  health and wellness as part of day to day living   she says   these students want the same values at the companies where they work  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to net impact  many of those students would take a    percent pay cut to work for an organization whose values align with their own     percent   to have a job that seeks to make a difference in the world either socially or environmentally     percent   or to work for a company committed to corporate and environmental responsibility     percent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and the focus on sustainability and social impact is expected to grow more and more mainstream not only among mba students but also at the companies they seek to work for  tuck school of business finance professor anant sundaram draws more students each year who want to take his class on business and climate change  which he says only makes sense   at many of the companies these students are targeting for post mba jobs  sustainability has become very central to how they operate   he says   we approach it in a very hard nosed way if you are the ceo of a shareholder value maximizing company  should you care about climate change and  if so  why  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>go into any major company and you will now find a chief sustainability officer  sundaram tells his students   not only is this a very senior manager in a policy making role  but it s also a new potential career path   he says   it s exciting  and it has all happened in the last decade in a significant way  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools leading the social impact charge so if student demand is high and the need for talent on the part of potential employers is poised for growth  which schools are best answering the call for an mba education firmly rooted in the tenets of social impact  we don t claim to offer a comprehensive ranking of the best schools for social impact   net impact devotes significant resources toward assessing the merits of different mba programs both in terms of sustainability and social impact and tells us the next  business as unusual  report is due out in fall        in the meantime  over the course of two articles  we re taking a deeper dive into some of what s on offer at a few of the schools doing it best  </paragraph>

    <author>Admissions Director Q&A</author>
  </authors>
  <title>admissions director q      a  maria pineda of umd s smith school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in response to our readers  interests  we are excited to have recently added a handful of new schools to the line up of mba programs we cover regularly on clear admit  the university of maryland s robert h  smith school of business is one of them  as part of our expanded coverage of smith  we caught up recently with full time mba admissions director maria pineda </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a    year veteran of the smith school s admissions office  pineda worked in undergraduate admissions in new york city before that   i wanted a change of scenery  so i was initially attracted to the smith school s location  with its traditional campus setting nestled next to a metropolitan city   she says  she s also a big believer in dean alexander triantis s vision of cultivating students to experience transformative change and then applying lessons learned to the workforce  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but it s the people that have kept her there   colleagues and faculty have the same mission  attract and develop students to be the next leaders  change makers or entrepreneurs   she says  the mba program s small class size also lets smith students build strong relationships while getting all of the benefits of a world renowned university   to me  one gets the best of both worlds  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>read on to learn more about just how the admissions process unfolds at smith  some of the most exciting things on tap  pineda s take on some of the shifts taking place in graduate management education and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what s the single most exciting development  change or event happening at smith this coming year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maria pineda  there are several things going on here at smith and at the university of maryland  both our women s and men s basketball teams are doing well  there is always a new building going up on campus  however  the most exciting thing to me is our internal curriculum alignment  outsiders probably do not see this  but this is exciting for us </paragraph>
    <paragraph>from admissions to faculty  from experiential learning to activities within the office of career services  we are aligning to ensure students are maximizing their two years here  we want students to experience everything they want in an mba program  but in the process of doing that  we want to make sure they are on track to meet their end goal  securing the job they want </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what is the one area of your program that you wish applicants knew more about </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mp  if i could pick one  i would say the tight knit community  here at smith  there is an innate desire to help others succeed  i know this may sound like a cliche  but it is true  for example  in the middle of finals week  one of our students who was transitioning from being a child advocate in a non profit organization to consulting was offered an interview for her dream internship  but she only had    hours to prep for it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after she told her career coach and one of her classmates about it  several people quickly volunteered to help  within a few hours  her classmates were conducting mock interviews and case based interviews with her  those who had contacts in the company and those who had worked for that same company prior to the mba helped her  she got the job  not only did she intern there  she was offered a full time position post mba with a lucrative salary and signing bonus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  walk us through the life of an application in your office from an operational standpoint  what happens between the time an applicant clicks  submit  and the time the committee offers a final decision  e g  how many  reads  does it get  how long is each  read   who reads it  does the committee convene to discuss it as a group  etc   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mp  once an application is submitted and all components are complete  an admissions committee member will read the entire file  this first reader will look at the applicant s strengths and weaknesses  noting anything unique and compelling  if the first reader sees fit and potential in this candidate  the applicant is invited to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before the in person or skype interview is conducted  the interviewer reviews the entire application including the first reader s notes adding other possible questions for the applicant  these can be simple  clarifying questions or they can be more complicated  like trying to understand the applicant s decision making process in regard to information found on the resume </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during the interview  our expectation is that we will gather more information about the applicant than what we have on paper  we want to get to know the real applicant  what are his her passions  what are his her goals  we intentionally ask questions that may seem challenging to make sure when one arrives in the fall  opportunities here align with the applicant s expectations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>post interview  the interviewer completes an interview report that includes any new information and confirms information found in the application  the interviewer is also asked to make a recommendation on the applicant  which can be admit  waitlist or deny </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after the interview write up is completed  the applicant is discussed in the admissions committee meeting  typically  after an interview  we will discuss an applicant within a week or two  yes  we sit together in a conference room and discuss each applicant  this committee is comprised of staff from admissions  student services and career services  everyone at the table has a vested interest in who we admit  so we have very honest dialogue about each candidate and his her potential  we spend hours every week in this meeting to ensure our outcomes align with our desired metrics and goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if an applicant is admitted  the application is sent to the umd graduate school  gs  for final review  the gs will look at the applicant s transcripts to review the academic record  international students do not have to submit transcript evaluations since all transcript evaluations are completed by the gs  they also ensure test scores are valid and that we are maintaining university of maryland standards in graduate level students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it usually takes a few days for the gs to get back to us  once they formally admit an applicant  we get to share the good news with the applicant  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>with so much buzz around this week s release of the      u s  news ranking of top business schools  we decided to devote this week s fridays from the frontline to a student perspective from one of the schools not even mentioned  because u s  news ranks only u s  business schools  some great schools elsewhere in the world get left out of the conversation  case in point  insead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>insead  with campuses in france  singapore and abu dhabi  boasts a remarkably diverse class made up of more than    nationalities  its accelerated    month program also appeals to students looking to gain an mba skill set without taking a full two years out from the work force  while not perfect for every prospective mba applicant  current student rayan dawud shares in the following post some of why insead  so far  feels just right for him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   the insead mba experience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when describing life at insead  students and alumni often talk about the world class courses and professors  the enriching extra curricular activities  and the outstanding career services  after an exciting kick off to the program these first two weeks with a variety of team building  orientation and preparatory activities  i thought it would be worthwhile to share some first impressions which i plan to reflect on at the end of the year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the people the insead mba class of december      is comprised of over    nationalities  my first reaction when i looked around the auditorium of my peers waiting for dean ilian mihov s welcome speech was to think about how incredible it was to experience this new meaning of the word  diversity  and to hear seven languages being spoken in my immediate vicinity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as i got to know my classmates  i realized that the diversity extended far beyond nationality  we had former doctors  lawyers  entrepreneurs  engineers  semi professional athletes  consultants  soldiers  bankers and even a member of an oscar winning movie production team  as someone who spent most of his life in one of the most multi cultural countries in the world and spent the past five years working for an international consulting company  i was extremely impressed with how well the admissions team had crafted our community  as dean ilian mihov stated in his welcome speech   everyone is a minority at insead  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the city   campus between talking to alumni and googling images  i thought that i had a pretty good idea of what to expect when i arrived  for the most part  i was way off </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fontainebleau is a bit of an oasis in the middle of the forest  but it s by no means a village  the town itself was much larger and developed than the sleepy french countryside i had originally pictured in my head  the school itself sits on a busy road about a    minute walk from the center of fontainebleau  and ch teau de fontainebleau  and neighbors several sports facilities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>although english is the language of instruction on campus  it doesn t hurt to pick up a few phrases in french to help with tasks like opening a bank account or getting a haircut  even if you fulfill your entry and exit requirements in two other languages </paragraph>
    <paragraph>orientation week activities if our first week was any indication of what to expect from insead  we re in for a challenging  exciting and rewarding year  the activities kicked off with campus tours and logistics sessions  how to apply for a residency permit  and was followed the next day  a friday  with a welcome address by insead dean ilian mihov and dean of degree programs urs peyer  the following monday many students sat for exemption exams where those with prior knowledge in specific topics could attempt to waive up to two core courses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>aside from logistics activities  the career center engaged with us right away to ensure that we began working with them to plot our career paths against our industry  geography and role preferences  we were immediately asked to schedule two meetings with our career advisors  one for cv review and one for career planning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>splash the splash program is a community service project whereby insead students take part in team based construction projects in insead s local communities  both in fontainebleau and singapore  we were divided into groups  by section  to build a playground at a local school for children with learning disabilities  pictured above   each section was tasked with setting and meeting specific goals with the support of the splash project team  as talented and diverse as we are  few of us had any real hands on construction experience  which made for an interesting day  the project was physically and mentally challenging  but it served as a crash course on how to communicate with a group of people from different backgrounds and work together on a tangible project  although the early bus and weather were challenging  the work was both personally and professionally rewarding and made many children happy  to get a closer look  check out this video </paragraph>
    <paragraph>start of classes by the time classes began  i was already so busy i had almost forgotten that i was here to study  my schedule for period   kicked off with  prices   markets  and  financial markets   valuation    although we had the option to sit for exemption exams in certain subjects and replace them with electives  the experience and levels of business acumen varied greatly among the classes  professors recognized this immediately and tailored their class discussions and assignments to strike a balance so that the more advanced students don t feel bored but the students new to business concepts don t fall behind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so far  so good here in fontainebleau  stay tuned in the coming weeks on how i landed at insead  the insead startup bootcamp and tips for a smooth transition when moving to fontainebleau </paragraph>

  <title>  things you need to know about the      u s  news business school ranking</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  reclaimed the number one spot in this year s u s  news   world report ranking of the nation s best mba programs after a two year stint in second place  stanford graduate school of business  gsb   which has passed the crown back and forth with hbs for more than a decade  took second  this year  tying with the university of chicago booth school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to the subtle movements of programs rising or losing a rank  there were quite a few surprises in this year s list  the clear admit team of admissions experts has sifted through the data and compiled a summary of seven key things to note this year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most shocking adjustment from      in terms of rank for an individual school was without a doubt nyu stern  which fell from the number    spot to number    this year  at first glance  it s hard to even imagine how this might happen  luckily   bob morse of u s  news was kind enough to publish a post explaining what caused this traditionally top    school to slide so precipitously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>morse explained that the reason for nyu stern s sharp decline was due to the fact that it did not submit its gmat gre scores on time    nyu  did not submit its data for the number of new entrants to both its full time and part time mba programs who provided gmat scores   he wrote  as a result  u s  news could not compute the school s average standardized test scores </paragraph>
    <paragraph>morse also states that while stern did provide the  omitted data points  later on  u s  news would not consider recalculating the scores  because  late is late </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while morse s blog post certainly possesses a whiff of passive aggression making one wonder if the drop in rankings wasn t more of a wrist slap  stern s inability to provide information by a deadline that every other school managed to meet does potentially raise questions about its administrative competence </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that said  the drop of nine spots on the list does seem harsh and  more importantly  incorrect  stay tuned to see whether or not this will damage the reputation of either u s  news or nyu stern  or both  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while a single position adjustment is no cause for alarm or debate about the difference in a program s worth  it marks the first time booth has ever outranked wharton  although the two did tie in      for fifth  and is also the first time the chicago school has secured a top three spot in the history of the u s  news rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to the rationale behind the program s movements on the list  chicago booth s climbing gmat average       and high employment numbers certainly played a part  furthermore  over the past few years wharton has been experiencing a mild slump on several rankings lists  most notably  financial times and businessweek   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>part of the problem may be rooted in wharton s admissions office and process   which can have a profound impact on a school s brand  in recent years  the school has experienced a high turnover of admissions directors  also  its reputation of having one of the most applicant friendly admissions processes has waned among potential students as well as alumni who are no longer called upon to interview applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the first time since       yale school of management  som  has ranked in the top ten  taking the number eight spot   its highest rank ever  the jump to number eight from last year s    spot is substantial  though not all that surprising upon inspection </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale has been making improvements on several fronts  in       the school hired dean edward snyder   the very same dean who sat at the helm of chicago booth during its meteoric rise in the rankings in the early     s  in addition  yale has been poaching high profile faculty from other schools over the last decade  notably  andrew metrick  professor of finance and anjani jain  current assistant dean  both were previously at wharton </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale has also achieved major progress with its facilities  completing the new edwards p  evans hall in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one more possible factor in yale s rise is its traditional strength and reputation as a leader in the non profit and corporate responsibility areas  which are in vogue with millennials </paragraph>

  <title>beyond business school  a sloan mba becomes the nhl s green guy</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>at clear admit  we are big believers in the intrinsic value of the mba not only in terms of graduates  earning power but also in terms of the myriad paths the degree helps prepare people to follow when they graduate  as part of a new series   beyond business school   we ll connect with alumni who have been out of school for a few years sometimes more to learn how they have gone beyond business school to make meaningful change in the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an architect with an mit sloan mba designs corporate social responsibility for the nhl</paragraph>
    <paragraph>how does an architect raised in florida who didn t even know how to ice skate come to lead corporate social responsibility for the national hockey league  nhl   for omar mitchell  an mba from mit sloan school of management proved the ticket </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mitchell knew from the age of four that he wanted to be an architect  and that s exactly what he focused on in college and graduate school  obtaining a master s in architecture from columbia university and going on to practice in a new york city architectural firm  the mid     s were boom years for real estate and  by extension  architecture   every half an hour there was a new building going up   mitchell says  at a firm focused on high rise residential and boutique hotels   we were flying high  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the financial crisis of      brought that to a screeching halt  forcing his firm to lay off    percent of its staff  even though mitchell was not among those let go in fact  he was being groomed to advance the unpredictability of architecture  so tied to the cyclical real estate economy  gave him serious pause   why would i want to subject my career to that kind of unevenness   he found himself asking himself  the idea of going back to school for his mba began to take hold </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  mitchell decided he wanted to study sustainability in real estate  his training as an architect had taught him that energy use in buildings accounts for    percent of energy use in the united states   if we can lower energy use in buildings we can make a significant difference   he says  in fact  that was the very pitch he used when applying to mit sloan   sloan s certificate in sustainability sealed the deal that sloan offers a certificate in sustainability was a major draw for mitchell   they have a curriculum established and developed specifically for folks with that interest   he says   and as a career switcher i wanted to make sure i would be able to message to the marketplace that not only am i an architect with technical expertise and an mba skill set  i also have this specialization   he says  other schools do feature joint programs  combining an mba with a master of environmental science or other advanced sustainably focused degree  but that didn t seem like the right route to him   going to the extreme of having another degree behind my name didn t seem necessary and i didn t need another year of grad school either   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mitchell felt like a kid in a candy store when he arrived at sloan  consulting  finance  technology  supply chain  operations so many paths presented opportunities where his skills as an architect would be transferable   architects are very rational and approach a problem in a very similar way to how you approach a business problem   he explains   you go from the biggest picture and drill down to the most intimate details like putting the guts of the building in you approach a business problem in the exact same way  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though consulting s rigorous and methodological way of approaching problems appealed to him  the expectation that you would learn entirely new industries in two to three months did not   i found myself much more at ease and comfortable being an expert within specific parameters  i began to realize that i wanted something defined  precise and in a single industry where i could leverage my architectural expertise  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so where does the nhl come in  of several summer internship opportunities mitchell had to decide between  one stuck out   the nhl had just started a program called  nhl green  and was taking one sloan student intern each summer to manage its environmental initiatives   he says  though just in its second year  the internship involved mitchell traveling to all of the different nhl arenas to evaluate their sustainability initiatives   it allowed me access to a lot of best practices and helped me see that what people were doing in the industry was trendsetting   he says   ice hockey is essentially played in a giant refrigerator so think about putting an energy star label on an ice rink  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> going into sloan i did not expect to go into pro sports at all   mitchell says with a laugh   what i realized is that professional sports have such a unique voice in telling an environmental sustainability story because sports have such a passionate following it presents a non political platform for spreading your message   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the roots of the ice hockey game  moreover  positions the nhl to advance a sustainability initiative in a truly authentic way  he adds   ice hockey players learn on frozen ponds or indoors where it costs a lot both in terms of money and energy to keep the rink cold   he says  fresh water scarcity is important to the nhl  climate change is important   they get it you can tell   says mitchell   the fans  the players  the league all understand   if my ponds don t freeze  i can t play   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>based on his findings during that summer internship  mitchell helped develop best practices for all of the nhl s clubs   they were very well received and showed the nhl as a premier leader in the space to advance this agenda   his internship landed him a full time job at graduation as the nhl s first ever director of sustainability   i essentially had a hand in writing my own job responsibilities   he says   because the job was so brand new it really gave me the opportunity to advance where the movement could head and how the nhl could be a leader    </paragraph>

  <title>gmat critical reasoning tip   mind the gap</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>let s start this post with a critical reasoning question </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when a group of people starts a company  the founders usually serve as sources both of funding and of skills in marketing  management  and technical matters  it is unlikely that a single individual can both provide adequate funding and be skilled in marketing  management  and technical matters  therefore  companies founded by groups are more likely to succeed than companies founded by individuals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before we dive into the answer choices  let s start by wrapping our heads around what this critical reasoning question is asking us  find the statement makes or breaks the conclusion of the argument   the gap in logic  the gmat likes airtight arguments  so they are looking for you to find and identify the hole </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to illustrate how we are going to mind the gap  let s start with a simple example </paragraph>
    <paragraph>matt is a lawyer   premise  matt went to law school   conclusion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sounds reasonable  right  of course  lawyers go to law school  well  not necessarily </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in some u s  states  paralegals who have been working for a period are eligible to take the bar exam and  if they pass  can become lawyers  same goes for patent attorneys  they are often required to have a terminal degree in engineering or science in combination with field experience to sit for the patent exam  many patent attorneys never darken the doors of a law school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alas  we have found the hole </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in concluding that matt went to law school  the assumption is made that all lawyers go to law school  without the argument stating that all lawyers go to law school  the conclusion that matt went to law school is not necessarily true   the argument falls apart  if there were multiple choice answers to the question  the one that references that assumption that all lawyers must attend law school would be the correct one to select </paragraph>
    <paragraph>easy enough  right  answering our practice question should be a piece of cake </paragraph>
    <paragraph>heading back to our question  when evaluating the hole  most students are going to fixate on the  single  versus  group  situation  but of course  a company started by a group of folks with varying skills is going to be more successful  you need a ceo  a cfo  and director of marketing  the head of it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>anyone ever heard of jeff bezos  michael kittredge  walt disney </paragraph>
    <paragraph>those test takers are going down the wrong path  the assumption being made is  actually  that good marketing  management  and technical skills equal success </paragraph>
    <paragraph>turns out  both mitt romney and donald trump have a few failed businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in theory  these types of critical reasoning questions should be as simple as our lawyer example  but clever wording and neatly disguised answer choices enough many gmat test takers to take the road often taken  where they select an incorrect answer choice  plus  they let the gmat prey upon assumptions they have made based on knowledge they have outside of the exam </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t be one of those test takers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the key to being successful on these questions to not only mind the gap  but aggressively  anticipating not only that a gap is already there  but that it looks like platform     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now that we have figured out truly the assumption on which the argument rests   that marketing  management  and technical success result in business success  let s evaluate the answer choices </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a  a new company is more likely to succeed if every founding member contributes equally to the company s initial funding than if some members contribute more funds than others </paragraph>
    <paragraph> b  some founding members of successful companies can provide both funding and skills in marketing  management  or technical matters </paragraph>
    <paragraph> c  new companies are more likely to succeed when their founders can provide adequate funding and skills in marketing  management  and technical abilities than when they must secure funding or skills from nonfounders </paragraph>
    <paragraph> d  founders of a new company can more easily acquire marketing and management abilities than technical abilities </paragraph>
    <paragraph> e  a new company is more likely to succeed if its technical experts are also skilled in management and marketing than if they lack management or marketing skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the correct answer is  should be  very obvious    c  is the only option that addresses that marketing  management  and technical skills equal success </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking for further guidance on how to mind the gap in critical reasoning questions  check out this video from brian galvin  director of academic programs  at veritas prep </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>

  <title>gmac debuts new executive assessment test designed specifically for emba candidates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>six leading business schools are piloting a brand new entrance exam designed specifically for applicants to executive mba  emba  programs  called the executive assessment test  ea   it was developed by the graduate management admission council  gmac   maker of the gmat  as an alternative to the gmat or gre that would require less preparation time while still allowing emba programs to effectively evaluate applicants  business school readiness </paragraph>
    <paragraph> because you are busy juggling the demands of work and home  the assessment is easy to schedule  short in duration and requires only modest preparation   reads the gmac website  the six schools participating in the ea launch are columbia business school  london business school  the university of hong kong  hku   the university of chicago booth school of business  insead and the china europe international business school  ceibs   gmac expects it to open to the rest of the industry a year from now </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because it is designed as more of a diagnostic assessment of analytical abilities than a rigidly scored exam  test takers should only need to plan for modest preparation in advance of taking the ea  ninety minutes in total  the exam will be divided into three    minute sections integrated reasoning  math and verbal  together  the sections are intended to measure skills critical both in an emba candidate s career and classroom experience  such as higher order reasoning  critical thinking  analysis and problem solving </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond serving as an evaluation tool for schools  results of the ea test are also intended to help prospective emba students identify which areas they might want to spend time focusing on before beginning their business school program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac developed the test with extensive input from peer schools  not only to provide a simpler option for test takers but also to more accurately measure the more extensive professional knowledge emba students bring to classroom   while the gmat is a strong predictor of success in core courses for our full time mba program  we discovered it was not as accurate a predictor of success for emba students   michael robinson  senior associate director of mba admissions at cbs  wrote in an announcement about the new offering   we believe the executive assessment will become the new standard for all executive mba programs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the exam will be administered at the same     gmac centers worldwide where the gmat exam is currently offered  prospective emba applicants who have already taken or still want to take the gmat or gre have that option those scores are still valid as part of the emba admissions process </paragraph>

  <title>global private equity challenge  oxford said vs chicago booth</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last month  students from two of the world s leading business schools took part in the first annual meeting between teams from the oxford said and chicago booth schools of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dubbed the oxford chicago global private equity challenge  this new finance competition brought representatives from the private equity institute at oxford said and the polsky center for entrepreneurship of chicago booth together for three days of discussion and case competition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the challenge is designed for students who are looking to develop careers in private equity and investment banking  participants from both institutions take part in a case competition where they are tasked with assessing the potential for a leveraged buyout of a publicly listed company and compete for a cash prize </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>well  it wasn t easy  to participate in the challenge  booth students had to create a team  prepare a proposal and financial model based on cases that were posted early in the fall term  and apply  from that pool of applicants  a selection of teams were asked to interview with a panel of private equity investors and academics  following the interview process  three teams were selected to compete in the chicago booth semifinals  the best booth team was sent packing for england where they went head to head with the top team from oxford </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  oxford students who wished to participate in the challenge had to take part in the bridgepoint private equity challenge  which aimed to find the smartest assessment of leveraged buyout opportunities in the united kingdom  andreas angelopoulos  executive director of the private equity institute and program director of the finance lab in oxford said  then chose a team of five from more than     students that participated in bridgepoint and mentored them for five weeks in the run up to the oxford chicago global private equity challenge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>both teams selected for the finals received a new list of possible cases and chose one to prepare a proposal for  the oxford team looked at moleskine  an italian notebook company  and put forward an investment thesis that looked at growth scenarios  marketing transformation  financing  valuation and returns  meanwhile  the team from chicago booth looked at the american gym company planet fitness  teams presented their final proposals to a committee comprised of chicago booth and oxford alumni </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to angelopoulos  the challenge was much more than just  well  the challenge  saying </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the three day program began with angelopoulos and tiago dias  corporate finance vice president of altice  presenting a seminar on acquisition finance modelling  this was followed by a presentation of a private equity case on the lbo acquisition of teamsystem in italy by luigi bartone  director of intermediate capital group  luca bassi  managing director of bain capital  federico leproux  ceo of teamsystem  and roberto ippolito  managing partner of riverrock  ippolito also happened to be an alumni of chicago booth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>then  after presenting their proposals to the investment committee panel  the teams had an opportunity to attend the   th annual private equity forum in oxford  which brought together academics and investors like blackstone gso  goldman sachs merchant bank  ardian  advent and cdc group to discuss challenges and opportunities facing the private equity sector </paragraph>
    <paragraph>humphrey battcock  managing partner of advent international  said </paragraph>

    <paragraph>the apartments are great  they are not high end  but are very well maintained  with      service  the kitchens  mostly kitchenettes  are equipped with a fridge  stove  dishwasher and sometimes a microwave  and are  a fair size to allow for cooking great meals  the apartments are not furnished so you have the ability to create your own home from the provided space  and ikea is only a    minute drive away   utilities and heat are included  the leases are approximately a year long for the first year  they start at varying dates and all end on june   th   for the second year they re for a whole year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs is a residential campus  how does that impact student life </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this means hbs is not only a school  it s a community  you have an opportunity to get to know your classmates  and their families  in a deep and real manner  these are the people you study with  live next to  eat with  party with  and lean on  for me  the impact is really feeling a part of something  hbs is far more than a place where you go just for an education  or a place you go to class in  its the place you meet new friends that over time  become your extended family </paragraph>
    <paragraph>is it possible for couples and families to live on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>definitely  living on campus amplifies the partners  part in the hbs community and family  the inclusive environment of hbs makes partners an integral part of the section  and living on campus allows them to attend more gatherings and partake in more activities with less logistics involved </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for families  the effect is even greater  hbs has a very active families club called crimson parents that arranges activities for families and children in a wide variety of ages  arranging everything from baby massage classes  through apple picking trips  and all the way to holiday parties   crimson parents also provides a resource for assistance from finding babysitters to meal trains when required  and creates a support structure for families that are away from their extended families </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how does the housing lottery work </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is one lottery for hbs housing that results in a dorm room offer being made in one of the rounds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is another lottery for harvard university housing  huh  apartments  both on and off campus  that result in assigned view and select windows  where applicants go online to look at available housing and can choose one  each lottery has a swap time at the end of it  students are encouraged to sign up for both lotteries to give them more of a chance  but if any student is coming with a partner or children  they can look at the huh apartments only  huh also gives priority to applicants with one or more children </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what advice would you give prospective students new admits as they think about their living options at hbs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make sure you understand what you really need  all options are good  it just depends on your personal requirements and preferences  if you can  come on campus for asw to see for yourself and get a better understanding of the options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for more information about housing options at hbs you can read the following blog posts </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit and prodigy finance host webinar on financing your mba abroad</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>late last month  clear admit teamed up with community funded loan provider prodigy finance to share information and answer questions as part of a free webinar for prospective mba students looking to study outside of their home country </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we were pleased to draw    registrants for the february   th webinar  and participants took part in a lively q a session at the conclusion of the presentation  today we re going to recap some of the key points for anyone who may have missed out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>financing your mba abroad poses specific hurdles the costs associated with pursuing an mba program at a leading business school today routinely reach six figures  which means that financing the degree can pose a significant challenge to almost any prospective applicant  but students looking to study outside the country of their nationality or residence face unique issues that can make financing business school even more difficult </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that s because traditional banks are reluctant to lend across borders  since doing so can make it harder to track and enforce loan repayment  many u s  banks  for example  won t lend to foreign students without a u s  co signer someone local the banks can go after to recoup their debt if the borrower fails to repay  and the same is true for u s  students looking to study in  say  spain </paragraph>
    <paragraph>enter prodigy finance a decade ago  a few mba students at insead found themselves facing precisely this predicament  realizing that they were probably not alone  the students came up with a solution  launching prodigy finance in       their answer  a community funded model in which international students attending mba programs abroad receive loans made possible by investments from alumni of the school they attend </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for instance  alumni who attended insead will invest in a bond to fund current insead students  additional investors often include the business schools themselves  the school community and other investors or institutions interested in higher education or social impact  by investing in these current international students  they are also investing in the value of the given school s mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today prodigy has grown to have offices in new york city  cape town and london  funded more than       mba students worldwide and given out more than      million in loans  more than     countries are covered as part of prodigy finance loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what does it mean for borrowers  this was at the heart of the february webinar  after an intro by clear admit co founder eliot ingram  prodigy finance student relations manager zach hirschfeld outlined some of the key benefits for mba students who receive loans through prodigy finance </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for starters  no cosigner  collateral or guarantor is required for any prodigy loan  loan recipients have a six month grace period after graduation before loan repayment starts  while the loans do carry an administrative fee  equal to     percent of the total loan amount   it is amortized over the lifetime of the loan  with nothing due up front  loans for students attending business school in the united states are disbursed in u s  dollars  finally  there is no fee or penalty if you decide to pay off your loan early instead  you ll simply benefit from a lower overall repayment expense thanks to savings on interest </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hirschfeld also drilled down into some of the things prospective applicants need to think through as they begin to contemplate financing their mba  first  says hirschfeld  consider your budget  most schools  financial aid offices provide an official cost of attendance figure  which is a great starting point  but also consider how you ll travel to and from the campus  where you plan to live during school and how many social events or trips you hope to take part in while a student  he suggests   try to talk to a student who is already at the school they will give you the best first hand perspective of how much it actually costs to attend so you can make a really informed decision about  in total  how many funds you need to properly afford the duration of the program   suggests hirschfeld </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the next step in the process is to take stock of your available funding sources from savings to scholarships  company sponsorship to help from friends and family   once you have taken this into consideration  sometimes you will need to fill the gap that remains through a loan   hirschfeld says   if you come to the conclusion that you will need to borrow either a little or a lot of that amount  prodigy can be a really great resource for you  </paragraph>

  <title>mba livewire lights up with stanford gsb dashed hopes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba livewire has shown interview invitations trickle in from round   applicants to stanford graduate school of business over the past couple of days  but it was today when the flood gates opened to let a wave of disappointed applicants spill forth sharing their news of rejection </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite some grumblings about how mean it was of stanford to reject people on march  th international women s day the school  in fact  was simply adhering to the date it had always said it would release round   applicants from consideration  had that date been a week later  applicants of irish descent might just as well have grumbled  and a week earlier could have upset the welsh </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those who are wondering  the pool of applicants invited to interview in round   by stanford gsb boasted an average gpa of      and an average gmat score of      the stats for those who didn t make the cut couldn t really have been much closer to identical  those reporting rejection today had an average gpa of      and an average gmat score of      and yes  those figures have been triple checked  for every round   applicant who reported an invitation to interview  two more faced rejection </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always with our mba livewire analysis  we should stress that the sample size is small and likely subject to some selection bias </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the commentary about international women s day  the notes and comments people have shared amid the wave of rejections today has ranged from understandable disappointment to relief that the wait is over to gracious encouragement for those prepping to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some of our faves  </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>as reflected in the remarkably parallel stats of the candidates invited to interview and those rejected today  strong scores and grades are a requirement to get into stanford gsb  but they are by no means a guarantee </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a hearty congrats to those who did receive an invitation to interview  don t forget clear admit s stanford gsb interview guide and the interview archive  both of which can help you prepare  best of luck </paragraph>

  <title>the growth of international indian mba students</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it shouldn t be a surprise to anyone that top mba programs are being flooded with applications from indian candidates  according to the graduate management admission council  the number of indians taking the gmat increased by nearly    percent from      to       and more than half of those gmat scores were sent to american business schools  in fact  from      to      a total of        indians took the gmat  third in the world behind the united states          and china          </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though most u s  business schools do not offer applicant information by geography  data gathered through alumni networks by the economic times provided some insight  for example  northwestern s kellogg school of management admitted    indians last year  and for the      application year its intake is greater than     the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  too  has increased the number of indian mba students it admits from approximately    to    last year to approximately    to    this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while schools such as harvard business school and wharton did not reveal their applicants  geographical backgrounds  kate smith  kellogg s assistant dean of admissions and financial aid  noted that india is a focal point for the school   we have seen many strong applicants from this region   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at some prominent business schools  international applicants now outnumber those from the united states  for example  at washington university s olin school of business     percent of candidates in      were non u s   but only    percent of the entering class was made up of international students  this is a large discrepancy and can make it difficult for indian mba applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these indian candidates are at a severe disadvantage for the best mba programs in the united states  many of the top schools are over saturated with indian applicants  so much so that it can be difficult to stand out  the average indian candidate has a high gpa  high gmat score and a background in computer software  while this is impressive  for indians it can mean that they are just one in the crowd </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indian applicants face far higher rates of rejection  for example  acceptance rates for indian applicants can be as low as   percent  while u s  applicants have an acceptance rate four to five times higher at    percent  there are many reasons for this discrepancy  ranging from the admissions committees  need to craft a more balanced and diverse class to language difficulties faced by some non u s  applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many indians are seeking mbas in the united states due to rapid growth back home  even if an indian already has an mba from an indian institution  he or she may apply to u s  programs to obtain a highly regarded american degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an mba from an american business school can help the indian young professional gain a high demand job as a skilled manager  setting him or her apart from the overwhelming number of technical and engineering focused applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another reason indians are heading to the united states for their mba is the perceived difference in educational quality from indian business schools  only one school  the indian institute of management in ahmedabad  made it onto the economist s ranking of mba programs this year  were it placed   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the big issue is that most indian business schools still struggle with teaching techniques that go beyond basic grading and assignments  unlike american schools  there s less focus on hands on experience  which puts graduates at a significant disadvantage  also  graduates only make         post graduation  about a quarter of the salary of graduates from the university of chicago booth school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the fact that indian mba applicants face steep competition  they also face the major obstacle of paying for their mba in america  thankfully  there are many top u s  business schools that offer mba scholarships specifically for indians students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  the average merit based scholarships given to indian students have increased by nearly    percent this year over last year at duke s fuqua school of business  yale school of management has also increased its indian scholarships </paragraph>
    <paragraph> round three of the admissions cycle is still in progress  and we don t release enrollment figures until the new class arrives  but overall  applications to yale have increased by about    percent year on year  and applications from india have increased too  all applicants are automatically considered for merit scholarships  and the school has increased its scholarship support overall   bruce del monico  yale som assistant dean and director of admissions  told the economic times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for where indian applicants should head to school if they re looking for a scholarship or fellowship  there are quite a few schools that offer financial aid for indian mbas  notably </paragraph>

  <title>career services at georgetown s mcdonough school  q a with doreen amorosa</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>five years ago georgetown university s mcdonough school of business convinced doreen amorosa to take over as associate dean and managing director of career services  despite the fact that she lived in new jersey  not washington  dc  and didn t plan to move  she did commute for the first few years  returning to central jersey to spend weekends with her husband  but they ve since sold that home and divide their time between dc and cape may   the center of the universe has shifted a little bit   she says with a laugh </paragraph>
    <paragraph>amorosa had spent all of her career working in new york city  including the first    years with merrill lynch  in her later years at merrill  she migrated into running recruiting and retention for the firm  discovering that was what she really loved  she went on to head recruiting for a range of other firms  including american express  traveling to the mcdonough campus in that capacity to recruit mba students  that s how the school recognized her talents and eventually wooed her to its side of the fence </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  amorosa reveals some of the latest techniques and technology she and her team have deployed to prepare mcdonough mbas for success whatever their chosen career path  read on to learn more about the jump start mcdonough students get on the job search process   hint  things get rolling in mcdonough s mba career center long before classes start   and don t miss the the new online community tool that connects current mcdonough students with alumni around the globe in a truly innovative way </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a proud hoya who earned her own b s  in management at georgetown  amorosa also shares how the jesuit ideal of  men and women for others  shapes not only the school  its students and its alumni  but even mcdonough s career services offerings   clear admit  what s new at mcdonough s mba career center since we spoke last </paragraph>
    <paragraph>doreen amorosa  a lot  we have rolled out several innovations in career services recently that i would love to talk about  first  we have put a set of protocols in place that begin as soon as a student accepts our offer  as soon as students say they are coming to mcdonough in the fall  we invite them to take part in our mba career ignition summer webinar series  which is designed to set them up for success in their eventual job search process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of this series  incoming students are tasked with a number of different deliverables  while not mandatory  taking advantage of them is definitely going to be in the students  best interests </paragraph>
    <paragraph>essentially  there are four deliverables on incoming students  plates between june and july  first  we ask them to complete an accomplishments record  which becomes the basis for the stories they are going to tell as they talk about their experiences and begin their elevator pitch development  the second deliverable is a value proposition  we want them to be able to formulate an answer for the question of  why am i going to get an mba and what am i going to do with it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>third and this was entirely new this past fall we have asked students to create an mba career inventory  more and more there is a need by incoming students for what we call  career clarification   they come in the door  and they are not really sure what they want to do or how to get clear on that  at the same time  employers want access to students earlier and earlier and earlier  so the sooner students can get clear about what they want to do  the more successful they are going to be in terms of their internship search  to this end  we have created an in house self assessment tool that helps students assess    different functional roles  we have to help them think multi dimensionally they should be thinking about not only an industry focus but also a functional focus  the tool is designed to help them make an informed choice about what direction they will pursue </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the tool provides a one page questionnaire about each of the    functions  where do you have experience  what are your interests  what s your prior background  your temperament  say a student has an interest in consumer behavior  using the tool  he or she can help determine some developmental goals and gauge how they will mesh with the position  students can take as many or as few of these functional inventories as they want  what do i know about private equity  it consulting  cpg marketing  universally  the feedback we have received is that these new tools prove really helpful because they open up a window for students of what s possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph>everyone knows about consulting  finance  marketing but often they don t realize all of these other functional specialty areas  many of which present possibilities they never thought of before  it s been a really big win for us in terms of helping incoming students get a sense of what s possible and create the tools needed to take it to the next step </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the final deliverable happens in july with the creation of their resume  so when they start school at the beginning of august  they have done all of that self reflection already  all of that work is done before they even get to campus  we have run the summer webinar series beginning in june for the past four years and found it to be very useful students tell us they are so happy to have the opportunity to do this work ahead of time when they could really focus on it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that s a best practice i brought with me to mcdonough from the corporate world  between when you give someone a job offer and they start employment  you have great mind share  and with students  since they haven t started school yet  we actually find we get better mind share now than we do when they hit the campus in august </paragraph>

  <title>round   at kenan flagler school of business  admissions director weighs in</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>for the right candidates  applying in round   to the university of north carolina s kenan flagler school of business is by all means a worthwhile endeavor  the school s admission director assures us  we spoke yesterday with sherry wallace  who has led admissions at the chapel hill business school for close to two decades   every year we get as many as    to    percent of our applicants in round    and we fully intend to admit from this round   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  the school will continue to accept applications beyond the march   th round   deadline if the class is not set at that time  and most of the time it s not  wallace says   we don t want to discourage anyone who happens to find us late to apply even then   she says  to be clear  there are not a ton of seats still available after the round   deadlines  she says   but for the right candidate who finds us late  there can definitely still be a spot  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school s final round is positioned by design relative to the enrollment deposit deadlines for the second and third rounds  wallace explains  kenan flagler s deposit deadline for rounds   and   is april   th  as it is for many schools   so by the time we are making decisions on round    we know what we have yielded for the other three rounds   she says   i can remember maybe one year in the    or so that i have been doing this when we were overflowing and couldn t make any offers in round     but she absolutely does not want anyone to believe that there is no chance of admission in round     wouldn t that be kind of mean to offer a round if no one would be accepted   she asks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wallace also wants to address concerns on the part of international applicants about applying in the final round   i can say that international students who are admitted in our last round should have no problem getting visas we haven t had that be an issue   she says   now  if they don t react right away if they sit on the offer for a while then they may have issues   she says   but as long as they act as soon as they get a late round acceptance  they should be fine  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wallace is very pleased with application volume so far  noting that it has matched last year s volume  resulting in a second consecutive year of double digit increases   our domestic pool is slightly bigger this year  but we still also have really strong candidates from outside the u s    she says   i am happy with the quality of the students who have accepted thus far and have every reason to believe we will have a really strong class   she continues   if i were looking and thinking about whether i might want to join kenan flagler  i would think this is a great year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t miss our latest admissions tip for more on applying to business school in the final rounds </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  kellogg student reflects on mba recruiting process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week s fridays from the frontline comes to us from kellogg school of management second year mba student rohan rajiv  a regular contributor to kellogg s full time mba student blog  in a series called mba learnings  rajiv has chronicled his progress through kellogg s mba program  in today s post  he shares candidly about mba recruiting  which he says  is probably the single hardest piece of the graduate school puzzle   peer pressure and self doubt can combine to make the process of landing a post mba job fraught with stress  read on to learn some of rahiv s tips for staying cool under pressure   the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   the inside perspective   kellogg s full time mba student blog   mba learnings  the recruiting journey through self doubt the mba learnings series has two objectives  the first is to develop the discipline to synthesize and share some powerful concepts i ve learned while at school  with about four and a half months left at school  i m hopeful that i ll continue to do this after i graduate as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the second has been demystify what the journey is really about  i have been surprised at the lack of really good resources on this topic  and i hope to have a definitive list of eight to    posts on the topic that will be helpful to prospective  admitted and current students after i graduate  i ve listed five posts i ve written so far on the topic at the bottom of this post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today s topic is one that aims to demystify an important part of the mba experience finding a job or to use a one word description  recruiting  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my experiences both as someone going through the journey myself as well as someone attempting to help others through the experience have shown that recruiting is hard  it is probably the single hardest piece of the graduate school puzzle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is easy to laugh this is almost as privileged a place to be when it comes to finding a job  some of the best employers around the world make it a point to invest hours and days on campuses to talk to students about what life at their firm is like  all definitely true  but i don t think life gets any easier when you are bill gates  sure  you take away worries about shelter  sustenance and the like </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but the kind of challenges you face are in no way inferior to everyone else  in fact  it is my belief that challenges of the mind tend to be the hardest to talk about and deal with  as evidence  i have learned that students from the law school and business schools at most universities are the biggest users of on campus counseling services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think this part of the experience is particularly hard for three reasons </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   every person going through the process has a track record of success that got them into school  it feels natural to expect this to work well with relative ease  and  in a few cases  it does  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   the fact that you re going through it with so many classmates some of whom do better than you by balance of probability increases the pressure </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   and finally  most of these folk have received really bad career advice in the past that has led them to believe that there is that one  dream company  out there for them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in my case  i think the peer pressure involved with the experience definitely made me question my own competence and abilities more than once  i made a couple of unusual choices and those came back as questions did i do the right thing  what if i had done things differently  it also took what seemed like ages for any progress to come through </paragraph>

  <title>decline of the unicorns  a startup tale </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in advance of his upcoming course   how to finance and grow your startup   without vc   set to start    april       london business school s blog recently spoke with management practice in marketing and entrepreneurship professor john mullins to gain insight into why we are starting to see a sharp decline in the value of so called  unicorn  start ups   mullins explained at a recent regent s park campus event that a combination of hysterical marketing  excessive funding  and untenable appraisals have caused the so called unicorns businesses valued at more than    billion to go extinct  hence the term  unicorpse  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mullins cites social messaging app snapchat and online marketplace app living social as two prime examples of the  unicorpse  phenomenon   venture capitalists were enamored with  living social s  ability to support local businesses through daily deals   mullins explains to the london business school blog   the company explored going public but living social never filed for an initial public offering and its workforce  fell  from some       at its peak in      to around     today   living social s more imposing nemesis groupon eventually went public to the morose tune of an     ipo discount </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mullins hopes to use the unicorn unicorpse phenomenon as a case study to debunk the notion that budding entrepreneurs need only seek out venture capitalists as their sole fund raising tactic  he explains that the behavior of doing so is motivated by a myth the venture capital community perpetuated due in part to the overwhelming value this method has generated in the past </paragraph>
    <paragraph> taking the time to find the right type of capital to match the specific needs of your company can be a much better idea   mullins elaborates in the london business school blog  customer funding  mullins argues in his      book the customer funded business  wiley   is a more stable yet highly misunderstood alternative to venture capital funding  richard branson  bill gates  and michael dell all know the reality  mullins posits   it s about time entrepreneurs started to question how appropriate vc funding is for their business and look to alternatives  like their customers  instead   otherwise we ll have mass extinction to look forward to </paragraph>

  <title>there s no biz like demographically diverse show biz</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>columbia business school  cbs  s website recently published new research that offers tangible solutions for increasing workplace diversity  this is an especially hot button topic in the realm of show business ever since the      oscars contenders were widely decried throughout the media as demographically homogeneous </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>the cbs research group confirmed a number of obvious assumptions regarding workplace diversity but uncovered specific strategies that both impeded and fortified diversity </paragraph>
    <paragraph> demographically diverse groups make better decisions and produce more innovations  because they bring in different perspectives   explains cbs professor katherine phillips  co author of the study </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite slightly higher rates of conflict  which can  impair group functioning and performance   diverse workplaces generally inspire greater efficacy and creativity while spurring economic growth on both national and global scales </paragraph>
    <paragraph>adam galinsky  lead author and fellow cbs professor  warns that  skin deep  diversity company policies are ineffectual without discrete strategies for implementation   the benefits depend not just on encountering unfamiliar situations  but on wanting to learn about and integrate them   he writes  galinsky also mentions that the efficacy of these policies must be supported by  incentives and resources to increase and manage diversity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the cbs research group recommends several strategies for expanding workplace diversity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the cbs website  the first course of action to creating a more diverse hollywood is to invite more diverse members into the academy of motion picture arts and sciences  there is already evidence that suggests that this is the direction tinseltown is heading  for instance  abc entertainment group president paul lee recently stepped down perhaps partially in response to the uproar and was replaced by former vice president of drama development channing dungey  the first african american woman to ever lead a major u s  broadcast network  star wars  the force awakens director j j  abrams remarked recently to e  news   i think the movies will get better  the stories will get stronger and audiences will respond bigger and that s good for the bottom line  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the article is quick to note that diversity within hollywood s industrial ranks will not necessarily guarantee that diverse perspectives will crop up more frequently in mainstream movies or that the nominees for the      oscars will necessarily be more diverse   real change requires more opportunities for under represented groups at every level of film making   notes the article on the cbs website </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  goizueta mba student shares emory s many healthcare focused opportunities</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this week  we featured an article highlighting some of the best mba programs for students interested in the intersection between business and healthcare  in reporting that piece  we came across a terrific recent blog post by a student working concurrently toward her mba at emory university s goizueta business school and her master of public health  mph  at emory s rollins school of public health </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that student  claire cooper  has generously given us permission to republish her piece here for the clear admit audience  read on to learn how cooper has sought out opportunities to gain hands on healthcare experience in the course of her time as a goizueta mba student and the advantages emory offers to other prospective healthcare focused business school students  the five semester  dual mba mph degree program in which collins is enrolled is one of three dual degree programs offered at emory for healthcare focused students  goizueta also offers its students an mba healthcare concentration that helps prepare them for a range of career paths in the healthcare industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   life at goizueta   the emory mba student blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>six ways to get hands on with healthcare by claire cooper</paragraph>
    <paragraph>considering its status as a top growing industry in america  it s no surprise that the business of healthcare is an area of growing emphasis at goizueta business school  in addition  atlanta is an ideal location to study healthcare  with world renowned medical research and treatment facilities and the center for disease control located steps from campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those considering concentrating in healthcare during their mba  i wanted to highlight how attending emory has helped me to delve into this field in exciting and hands on ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the dedicated healthcare management practice course  students are tasked with evaluating the prospects of commercial success of    medical device innovations competing for translational research funding  daily guest lecturers with years of experience evaluating such products mentor us and guide our thinking in determining which projects should be presented to funders  our work will directly inform the awarding of one million dollars of grant funding from the coutler foundation  associated with emory medical center </paragraph>
    <paragraph>goizueta students are allowed to take classes across campus at any of the other graduate schools or undergraduate classes for no additional fee  and for credit toward their mba  for example  i recently took a weekend long course at rollins one of the top ranked public health schools in the nation focusing on preparedness and planning for emergencies  taught by practitioners at the cdc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alternatively  if you plan ahead  you can complete both your mba and your master of public health degrees in only five semesters </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this semester alone i attended a phenomenal lecture and discussion led by naz modirzadeh  a law professor at harvard  on international law and ethics regarding the provision of healthcare and humanitarian aid in crises  there was as well a day long environmental health conference led by both local decision makers and international stakeholders </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kevin manion  a classmate from the class of       has begun a mentoring program that pairs biotech startup companies involved with an incubator program locally with mba students  we ve supported them in developing their market research and pitch and in targeting their messaging </paragraph>
    <paragraph>major players in the healthcare industry such as mckesson  genentech and emory healthcare actively recruit and interview on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond these opportunities  my healthcare focused classmates have taken courses such as  the business of healthcare  and  healthcare product and brand   many have participated in healthcare case competitions hosted by consulting companies  giving students the opportunity to delve into common problems faced by the industry and to show off their acumen to potential employers  several of us attended vanderbilt s healthcare conference </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as a major focus in goizueta s strategic growth plan  i look forward to seeing even greater opportunities in coming years for the development of those students interested in shaping the future of healthcare in this country and abroad  to me  it s critically important to combine my interest in business with my passion for healthcare  i hope to keep finding ways to build on this intersection </paragraph>

  <title>could nike s phil knight pay for your stanford gsb mba    </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>nike inc  co founder philip knight has given      million to stanford university to establish a scholarship program that will fully fund     high achieving students each year in their pursuit of graduate degrees at any of stanford s seven graduate schools  including stanford graduate school of business  gsb   the new knight hennessy scholars program  announced yesterday  is co named for stanford s outgoing president john l  hennessy  who will become the program s inaugural director when he steps down as president later this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> john and i dream of a future        or    years from now  when thousands of graduates who can think outside the box as skilled problem solvers will be working together for a more peaceful  habitable world   knight said in a statement  his gift is intended in part to honor the outgoing president s    year tenure leading stanford  he added  calling hennessy  one of the great academic leaders of our time  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>knight hennessy scholars to rival rhodes scholars stanford portrayed the new program as a rival to other distinguished scholarship programs such as the rhodes scholarship program  incorporating their best aspects but going beyond them  to offer a diverse  multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary education that is a hallmark of stanford  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we wanted to create something enduring  that would be unlike anything else currently available to the world s brightest minds  and that would make the biggest impact possible toward solving global challenges affecting the environment  health  education and human rights   hennessy said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program will seek to recruit students from a wide range of backgrounds and nationalities who demonstrate leadership and civic commitment  knight hennessy scholars will receive funding for three years to pursue master s or doctorate level degrees at any of stanford s seven top ranked graduate and professional schools  including the schools of law  business  medicine  engineering  humanities and sciences  education  and earth  energy and environmental sciences  stanford noted that scholars pursuing phd or md degrees will have the option to receive funding beyond three years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>complete admission and curriculum criteria are not yet available  but stanford has shared that prospective applicants must be nominated by their undergraduate universities and have completed at least three years of their undergraduate education  although they can apply up to four years after they have graduated  the first applications will be accepted in summer       and the first knight hennessy scholars will be admitted for fall      </paragraph>

  <title>the business of healthcare  mba programs that best prepare students to tackle a challenging industry</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>shaan patel s path to business school was a little different than most  with three years of medical school under his belt  the las vegas native traded the university of southern california  usc  for yale school of management  som   where he ll complete his mba before returning to usc for his final year of med school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> as a medical student  i wanted to learn more about healthcare management   he says  yale som has been great  he continues  offering plenty of healthcare electives as well as opportunities to collaborate with the yale school of medicine   one of the problems with medical school is that you become so focused on the pathophysiology of disease and clinical medicine that there s not much exposure to the business side of medicine  healthcare administration  insurance   he says  one yale som class in particular  healthcare  economics  finance and policy  helped him learn about things like medicare  medicaid and the roles played by pharmaceutical and insurance companies   most medical students have to learn those things on the job after they are in practice   patel notes  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while med students who take a leave of absence to pick up an mba along the way are not all that common  business students looking to specialize in healthcare make up a solid slice of the student body at several leading business schools for a host of reasons  for starters  healthcare is a recession proof industry offering a range of potential career paths  mba graduates can go on to work as administrators in hospitals  long term care facilities and rehabilitation facilities  as senior managers at insurance  biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms  or in increasingly prevalent healthcare focused roles in investment banking  consulting or venture capital  and with the digital health market expected to reach        billion by       it should come as no surprise that healthcare entrepreneurship is hot  too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>climbing healthcare costs have made identifying ways to generate profits while benefitting both providers and patients a constant challenge  aging populations in both the united states and europe ensure that strains upon the industry will only increase  and the introduction of the affordable care act  aca  in the u s  has shifted the paradigm of how doctors and hospitals are paid and how they deliver care  creating both new complexities and opportunities for innovation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as you can see  the question isn t why prospective applicants are seeking out mba programs that can teach them the business of healthcare  the question is which business schools do it best  </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan alum s app combats hiring biases</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an interview conducted for a recent press release published by mit sloan  alumna stephane lampkin  mba      discussed blendoor  an innovative new mobile app she designed to counteract hidden hiring biases related to gender and race </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lampkin  a stanford and mit sloan alum with five years  experience at microsoft under her belt  interviewed for an  analytical lead position at a major tech company   after eight separate visits  lampkin was told she was not an ideal fit for the company  the recruiter lamented   you re not quite technical enough  we ll reach out if a sales or marketing position opens up   lampkin told mit sloan news that the rejection provided the creative fuel to dream up blendoor   it s not necessarily overt racism  it s the way we re wired as human beings  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lampkin envisioned blendoor as a mobile access point to enable tech industry recruiters to find diverse  qualified applicants namely underrepresented people of color  women  and veterans and vice versa  according to a wall street journal study featured in the sloan press release  women make up less than a quarter of the workforce at the leading technology companies  the american economic association found that employers were twice as likely to respond to cvs with  white sounding names  in a      study entitled  are emily and greg more employable than lakisha and jamal    time and time again we see people being discriminated against because of the way their name sounds or the color of their skin   lampkin explains </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the  tinder like  gui anonymizes job seekers so companies are presented with  nameless  faceless profiles  that provide only the candidate s cv  lampkin explains   by hiding name and photo  we are basically showing recruiters how well a candidate meets the requirements of the role  and create opportunities for people who many have otherwise been overlooked because they didn t look the part  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in turn  blendoor job hunters are given access to a database of employment opportunities  once potential employers find a match  they can connect with candidates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so far  lampkin has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from the tech industry  between direct investments and pitch competition prizes  blendoor has pulled in a respectable          in funding  lampkin is initiating a full throttle pr campaign that will hopefully increase that figure to    million by april  down the line  lampkin envisions blendoor s impact could extend to housing  finance and beyond </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  ross mbas get investment tips from warren buffett</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how would you like to trade investment tips over lunch with warren buffett  a group of mba students from the university of michigan s ross school of business had just that opportunity last month  two of them  cazzie palacios brown  mba ms      and michelle gross  mba ms       shared their experiences and some of what they learned from the value investing giant in a recent post on the ross student voices blog  they have generously allowed us to repost their piece here for the benefit of clear admit s readers  read on to learn how buffett classifies investments  his views on social impact investing  why he still uses a flip phone and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  ross student voices  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>warren buffett gave us a few investment tips over lunch</paragraph>
    <paragraph>warren buffett made his first investment at age     just five months after the bombing of pearl harbor  when we spoke to him last month  he said this was his biggest missed opportunity   not starting to invest earlier  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it was the first of many lessons we would hear from mr  buffett during several hours spent with him in omaha last month over lunch and a fireside chat with    other michigan ross students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite his wealth  fame and success  mr  buffett was incredibly humble and relatable  he shared insights and lessons from his professional experience and also offered us advice for a life well lived </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mr  buffett lives by the investment thesis   the world will do well over time   he pointed out to us that  despite two world wars  flu epidemics and other challenges  the dow jones industrial average has risen from    at the beginning of the last century to more than        today </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of what to buy  mr  buffett classifies potential investments into four categories </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he sticks to investing in the  important and knowable  category  and does not believe in getting sidetracked by microtrends like the internet bubble  it s worth noting here that he s so committed to this  he continues to use a flip phone and is still figuring out the voicemail function </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we toured three of the    subsidiaries that mr  buffett has invested in through berkshire hathaway  all of which he considers part of his  important and knowable  quadrant  oriental trading company  otc   borsheim s jewlery and nebraska furniture mart  there we met with executives such as borsheim s cfo erin limas and otc ceo sam taylor  who also happened to appear on an episode of undercover boss  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the issue of impact investing  or investing in businesses with a social cause  he  disagrees with many of his friends  because he believes  you can only maximize one variable at a time  profit or impact   mr  buffett told us he focuses on profit  though emphasized the incredible value of good business and integrity   but he has big plans to use most of his accumulated wealth for philanthropy  you ve heard of the warren buffett and bill gates giving pledge  right </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mr  buffett s views on impact had us thinking about and discussing what social impact means and how it can be created by organizations  corporations  communities and society as a whole  it sparked us to discuss and debate about where responsibility lies to create a positive impact in the world  and it raised questions about personal leadership styles and the types of impact we seek to create in the world </paragraph>

  <title>mba decisionwire entries reveal interesting applicant journeys</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with just a little over a month since mba decisionwire debuted  we re delighted that hundreds of applicants have already chosen to submit their admissions stories via this new resource  for the uninitiated  mba decisionwire is a crowdsourced companion tool to our hugely popular mba livewire  but distinct from mba livewire  which provides up to the minute insights from applicants at each stage of the admissions process  mba decisionwire is designed to capture an applicant s complete journey reflecting every school applied to  acceptances received and each applicant s ultimate revealing decision of where to actually enroll </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i was an absolute addict on livewire when i just had to know who was hearing what from which schools   shared one site visitor   but decisionwire  by virtue of reflecting how people are actually making the final call when faced with some tough choices  has been just as useful to me in a different way  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  the stories shared via mba decisionwire give valuable insight into the challenging decisions applicants face when presented with multiple acceptance offers and the factors that contribute to their decision of where to actually attend business school  of course  by gathering gmat and gpa data as well  mba decisionwire also lets those just beginning the application process benchmark themselves against those who have come before them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what really matters when choosing where to enroll  so  what matters most to applicants when it actually comes down to deciding where to enroll  the results are varied  not surprisingly  pedagogy  school reputation and perceived career opportunities are significant considerations for many  for instance  wharton s strength in marketing and entrepreneurship together with its alliance with insead proved more compelling than the university of chicago booth s international mba  imba  program for this applicant with a strong finance background looking to head into general management </paragraph>
    <paragraph> another applicant from this year applied to dual degree programs at each fuqua  ross and kellogg   chose northwestern s jd mba   the candidate shared   ultimately  business school ranking and career opportunities were the greatest influencer despite having received very generous scholarship opportunities from duke and michigan  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden s case method and small class size made it the better choice for this      applicant  who was deciding between charlottesville and charlotte after a rejection by nyu stern </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>show me the money money  of course  has made a difference in many decision making processes  here  chicago booth was the clear choice over dartmouth s tuck school of business when the former offered scholarship money and the latter did not </paragraph>
    <paragraph> but when both wharton and columbia business school offered fellowships to this      applicant  wharton s winter welcome weekend and its strength in leadership made the difference </paragraph>
    <paragraph> location  location  location sometimes  though  it really comes down to location   london is just an amazing city that i d love to spend     years living in not to mention the networking opportunities   wrote an applicant from this year who has enrolled at london business school  choosing it over cambridge s judge school of business and hec paris  which also offered him or her admission </paragraph>
    <paragraph>school x or bust certain applicants  of course  have a single minded focus on one school and one school only  we love to see them attain their goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  even entries that don t offer explanations within the notes section still present the dilemmas applicants have faced when confronted with acceptances at multiple top schools while also giving prospective applicants useful data points against which to benchmark their own candidacy </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph> super cool tool  i wish this had been around when i was making my decisions about where to go to business school   one early user told us  to be clear  we re excited to receive submissions from applicants just as they are making their decisions as part of this admissions season  but current students and alumni are also invited and encouraged to weigh in  an  entering year  field lets you select any of several recent application years  and those who have been out of school for a while can simply indicate  other  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>quick  easy and anonymous as the data continues to roll in  mba decisionwire will help prospective applicants just beginning to process extract valuable data points  as with mba livewire  mba decisionwire is completely anonymous and designed to be intuitive and easy to use  most users tell us that entering a submission takes a minute or less  and the search functions allow for easy filtering of previous entries </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph> while most candidates for this year have not yet made their final choices  deposit deadlines for round   are rolling along  so we are hoping that those who are finalizing their decisions will now add their  story    says clear admit s alex brown  who helped develop the new tool   we re thrilled at the early response to mba decisionwire thanks to everyone who has already submitted an entry   he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  mba decisionwire stands to grow even more interesting and valuable as more submissions roll in  so check it out  share your story and tell your friends and classmates to do the same </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a frequently asked questions page provides additional information about the tool  but if you have any additional questions or feedback  please contact dw clearadmit com  </paragraph>

  <title>columbia uncovers how honest faces often correlate with credibility</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>columbia business school  cbs  recently announced via press release its fascinating research into the relationship between faces perceived as trustworthy and whether or not those faces can actually be trusted  columbia business school professors and psychologists daniel ames and michael slepian explain that our knee jerk rulings of certain faces are more often than not accurate but for reasons one might not expect </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the press release  slepian explains   we found that people who looked trustworthy were in fact more likely to act trustworthy  finding evidence of the link between faces and honesty led us to dig deeper into why this link might emerge  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in ames and slepian s clinical survey  the duo requested that one collection of test subjects evaluate photos of individuals based on their perceived level of trustworthiness  this group of test subjects engaged in person with a different set of participants than the ones featured in the photos  in advance of the face to face engagements  the participants predicted the frequency at which the test subjects would trust them  these in the flesh participants also had financial motivation to avoid telling the truth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ames and slepian ventured that most of us have internalized expectations of how people expect us to behave and we act in accordance with these impressions  confirming the psychologists  suspicions  they found that the value judgments that test subjects made based on faces they encountered in the photos were a reliable prediction for how frequently the other group would lie in person </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the expectations that participants had for how test subjects would engage them correlated with their behavior based on others  perceptions of their level of  facial trustworthiness   it turns out that faces are accurate predictors of credibility because people tend to act in accordance with the judgments of others that they have learned to anticipate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ames elaborates in the columbia press release </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while the findings propose that faces may or may not convey certain signals  both ames and slepian insist that the major conclusion of the research relates less to signals that we subconsciously evaluate and more to the cumulative  internalized responses to others  expectations </paragraph>

  <title>nyu stern s center for sustainable business launches with    million from citi foundation</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>new york university s stern school of business today launched its new center for sustainable business  aided by a    million investment by the citi foundation  with leading environmentalist and former rainforest alliance president tensie whelan at the helm  the center will work to educate a new generation of business leaders capable of and committed to doing well by doing good </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern and the citi foundation have collaborated for more than a decade on programming to educate students on ways the private and public sectors together can help tackle some of the greatest challenges facing the planet today while driving sustainable economic growth  the new center s launch promises to expand these efforts through coursework  thought leadership and research  and stakeholder engagement and projects </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the citi foundation is helping us to get this whole center off the ground because it has a strong history of both inclusive business and innovation around sustainability   whelan says  in addition to its major investments in sustainability  the foundation also has a specialist on staff who works with teams around biodiversity and is even developing a new asset class around energy efficient loans  she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern  meanwhile  makes perfect sense as a home for the new center for sustainable business   business schools are the place where the future business leaders learn and we are at a phase in our global history where we need a new generation of leaders who adopt the idea that their businesses need to contribute value to society  not simply extract and deliver value to shareholders   whelan says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that stern sends large proportions of its graduates into finance and management consulting is also favorable in terms of the reach of the center s initiatives   we need more business leaders in finance who are looking to incorporate sustainability into their investment decisions   whelan says   on the consulting side  i believe that more and more consulting efforts will be focused on helping companies transition to become more sustainable   she adds   it is exciting to have students going into these sectors where they will have real impact  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new center s location in an urban area  too  is advantageous   we know that much of the future s growth will be coming in cities  and there will be a series of sustainability challenges associated with that growth  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a running start since stepping into her new role early last month  whelan has worked to establish an advisory board for the center that can help forge additional connections between academia and the corporate world  the board includes citi global head of productivity david chubak  raphael bemporad  founding partner of bbmg  nespresso usa president guillaume le cunff  and john d  williams  president and chief executive officer of domtar  creating an ongoing dialog with companies that understand sustainability can no longer be pushed to the periphery and that lead by example is one of her primary areas of focus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she s also focused on programming  specifically developing core sustainability classes for undergraduate and graduate business students   these will be very practical and hands on covering what you need to know to run a company in a way that is sustainable and bringing in guest speakers who are actually doing that   whelan says  the center will also provide executive education  working with companies interested in specially designed courses to help their executives learn sustainable practices  longer term  whelan hopes to also set up consulting projects with partner companies that will give students an opportunity to take what they are learning out of the classroom and into the boardroom   </paragraph>

  <title>entrepreneurship  kellogg  newest zell fellows settle in</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>though best known for producing a steady stream of crackerjack consultants and marketing mavens  northwestern s kellogg school of management is also making inroads when it comes to educating entrepreneurs  through the kellogg innovation   entrepreneurship initiative  kiei   the school is pioneering a lean methodology approach to launching new ventures that is steeped in experiential learning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to complement its  new venture creation  track  coursework that takes students through the full life cycle of new ventures from ideation to launch  kellogg also features a special program offering support to mba students who are trying to get ventures off the ground by graduation  called the zell fellows program  it is open to students who are either founding a startup or looking to grow an early stage venture  in december  nine students were selected as the newest cohort of zell fellows  with ventures ranging from a service that takes the stress out of packing lunch by delivering customized  allergy friendly meals directly to families  homes to a platform that creates interactive guides that hotels can give their guests at check in </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to david schonthal      program director and clinical assistant professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at kellogg  more than     students expressed interest in the program this year and roughly    submitted applications to be considered for participation  the cohort size remains small  though  because that s part of the program s unique  intrinsic value </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the fact that they go through this program together as a nine person cohort is super powerful   schonthal says   they develop strong relationships with each other  enhance and support one another they really become an advisory group for themselves almost like a young presidents  organization   he says  referring to the global peer network of ceos and business leaders  the support continues well after graduation  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the financial support zell fellows receive is another main benefit of the program   it provides a lot of resources that are often hard to get as you re just starting a business   schonthal says  with approximately         in funding per student  the program helps pay for business services ranging from graphic designers and coders to prototype shops and legal assistance   we believe their first job is to be a good student  so if we can provide services to help them advance their businesses while still focusing on being students first  that s great   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and then there s exposure to entrepreneurship beyond kellogg  in addition to treks to the san francisco bay area  students go on a trek every year to israel where they spend time with the program s benefactor  equity group investments chairman sam zell   we want them to get a sense that as zell fellows they are part of a global network of entrepreneurs   schonthal says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new this year is an executive coaching component  pairing zell fellows with seasoned entrepreneurs who serve as mentors and advisory board members and provide coaching tailored to individual entrepreneurs  needs   we offer lots of different resources to support each of them on their path   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now it its third year  the zell fellows program counts    fellows     of whom are running or have founded businesses  collectively  they have raised more than    million in funding  and    of the student founded ventures are still active </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>we know  tom petty  waiting is the hardest part  and some schools cough  stanford graduate school of business  gsb   cough certainly aren t making things easy on round   applicants  the stress is high  the updates are few and the results are pure poetry </paragraph>

    <paragraph>adele s popularity flat grammy performance notwithstanding is clear  but lionel richie  notorious b i g   jack johnson  aloe blacc  richard marx  ice cube  drake  taylor swift and warren g lyrics have also all provided points of departure for our creative in the face of anxiety crowd  eclectic musical tastes  we ll give you that </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>adding to the mix have been a haiku or two  a random non sequitur completely apropos of berkeley and a clever tuition payment plan </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  waiting for bolton of course  stanford gsb mba admissions director derrick bolton has received a couple of call outs by name  we ll check in with him to see if he has a favorite and report back </paragraph>

  <title>haas school of business grants seed money to mba student entrepreneurs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>uc berkeley s haas school of business awarded the first round of grants in a new program that intends to inspire mba student entrepreneurs to grow early stage startups </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the berkeley haas entrepreneurship program  bhep  awarded these first ten grants in december       and the next round will be bestowed in april      </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph> we re off to a great start with these ideas that attack pain points in industries ranging from agriculture to healthcare   bhep director rhonda shrader said in a statement   our student teams are so excited to begin testing their concepts  and this fund is generating a fresh level of enthusiasm among our student entrepreneurs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one concept that earned funding from the bhep is clima  which was initiated by mba student saharnaz safari  mba       during a road trip from san diego to the san francisco bay region  safari was struck by the drought ravaged landscape  she and her travel mate  an aerospace engineer  began to brainstorm about how drone technology might be used to help farmers in their plight to keep crops going amidst the drought  thus spawned clima </paragraph>
    <paragraph>safari and her colleague imagine a fleet of drones that could create rain and snow that would provide the moisture the land needs to rejuvenate  while these drones would be costly  at about         apiece  safari and her partner will use the grant to procure a smaller model that can be used to develop the concept and raise capital for the larger effort </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the fund has been very important in helping us build a minimum viable product   safari said in a statement   it also paves the path to receive additional funding  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other grant recipients will use their funding to develop an app that helps diabetics make healthy food choices  while another group is creating an app to provide assistance for citizens of impoverished communities in india </paragraph>

  <title>new startup marketplace matches haas mba students  scientists via speed dates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba students at uc berkeley s haas school of business have been taking part in speed dating of sorts with faculty and scientists at the university of california san francisco s school of pharmacy  have no fear this is not a story about anti fraternization policy violations or scandal  instead  it s a tale of creative matchmaking that gives haas students valuable experience with early stage science startups that need their business know how </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the idea was born out of a conversation last year between haas dean rich lyons and ucsf school of pharmacy dean joseph guglielmo  abby scott  associate director of emerging initiatives at haas  took the idea and ran with it developing it into the pilot startup marketplace  which launched in september      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the startup marketplace brings interested mba students together with ucsf faculty and scientists for a live online session in which each side delivers a brief elevator pitch to the other  after a series of online  speed dates   parties on both sides rank their top choices and matches are made </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the haas students devote between    and    hours during the semester consulting with the science startups  in the fall semester  seven mba students took part  many of them from haas s evening   weekend mba program  anita lal  ewmba      helped develop a roadmap charting potential business paths for alaunus biosciences  a startup that has developed a profiling technology to identify new drug targets and diagnostic biomarkers  alaunus was co founded by ucsf pharmaceutical chemistry professor charles craik </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s perhaps no surprise that craik saw something in lal as part of the speed dating process  in addition to work experience as a program manager at siemens healthcare and the business knowledge she s gained as a haas mba student  lal also happens to hold a phd in biochemistry and molecular biology  but the relationship has equally worthwhile for lal   for me  it s just exciting to see how a startup evolves and the hurdles that it faces   she said as part of the haas article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mentors provided by haas offer support to the mba students participating in the startup marketplace program  participating mentors have included startup advisor deepak gupta of the berkeley haas career management group  cmg  and rhonda shrader  who directs the berkeley haas entrepreneurship program  bhep  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with positive feedback from both parties in many of the matches made last fall  haas is expanding the pilot program with a new crop of participating students and startups this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we d like to see where we can take this next   said scott   in the future  we can bring together students with partners developing all kinds of different technologies  i can imagine us going to other departments  perhaps even working with incubators directly  or even moving it beyond just berkeley  </paragraph>

  <title>five tips for keeping love alive in business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as any business school student will tell you  the pressures of a top tier mba program can be overwhelming  and as anyone who s been in a romantic relationship can attest  care and attention are required to keep things on track  trying to tackle both simultaneously definitely presents some challenges  but couples from a range of leading schools assure us it can indeed be done </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in honor of valentine s day  they ve generously shared their tips for keeping love alive in business school  read on to learn what s worked for them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>be honest with yourself and each other about expectations nick arnold  who spent    years in the marine corps before heading to georgetown s mcdonough school of business  stresses the importance of understanding as a couple what you want to get out of business school before you get there  he and his wife  melissa  arrived at mcdonough with a six week old daughter  camille   i faced a couple of learning curves   the new dad jokes   we were very fortunate that we were clear with each other about our goals and expectations  which i think was key to navigating any of the challenges we ve faced   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it has been an exercise for my wife and me in terms of having clear priorities around what s important for us   he says   first and foremost is our daughter head and shoulders above all else   mcdonough  in washington  dc  was a top choice because it felt like a good place for a family  combining the advantages of urban life with lots of green space  melissa was also able to get a job working at medstar georgetown university hospital  an obstetrician gynecologist  she s fortunate to have highly transferable skills  nick notes   there will always be babies being born all over the world  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the decision to come to business school wasn t made overnight  he adds   it was something we thought about for a couple of years beforehand  so we had a good idea coming into it of what to expect  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>communicate and share calendars for mark schmid and brittany frye  who moved to charlottesville for mark to attend the university of virginia s darden school  keeping communication channels open has been key  the two are engaged to be married on july          at a charlottesville winery </paragraph>
    <paragraph> mark has always been really transparent  sharing what he is doing  what he s working on  keeping me in the loop   brittany says   it s also been a big advantage for us that brittany works here at the school   mark adds  as soon as mark got accepted  brittany began looking for a job in charlottesville  ultimately securing a marketing position with darden s executive education program   we carpool in together in the mornings  which gives us a chance to talk about whatever s going on   mark says  they also frequently have lunch together or meet up for first coffee  which takes place each morning at      in darden s pepsico forum   it s just downstairs for brittany   mark says   we are very lucky that we can do a lot of our communication in person   he adds  and if it s a particularly crazy day and they aren t able to see each other  they remain in touch via text </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we also make appointments on our outlook calendars for each other   brittany says  quick to confess that more often than not she is the one putting events on the calendar for him   as long as i put it on his calendar that we have dinner plans with friends  then that time is reserved  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg school of management couple jill and zac seidel also swear by shared calendars  zac is a second year mba student at kellogg and jill is in her first year of the dual degree mmm program  from which graduates receive both a kellogg mba and an m s  in design innovation from the segal design institute at the mccormick school of engineering and applied science   we share each other s calendars on our phones and send each other calendar invites for quite literally everything   jill says   if i have a group meeting one night  i send a calendar invite to zac to watch our son   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even valentine s day plans were set up by calendar invites  jill says   i am a lucky girl   she teases   i got a calendar invite two days ago for a dinner date on sunday  and zac arranged a babysitter for us   their    month old son david will become a big brother in april  when jill is due to give birth to their second child  which promises to ratchet up their reliance on shared calendars and babysitters even more </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  an mbalauncher shares her round   application process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>today s friday from the frontline features an interview with lisa atufunwa  a    year old denver native who submitted applications to five schools as part of round    business school has always been a part of her plan  and she s hoping the mba will help her pivot her career </paragraph>
    <paragraph>currently working in communications for a range of tech companies  startups and public holding companies  atufunwa is targeting schools with strong programs in marketing  her post mba goal is to become an assistant brand manager in the personal beauty sector  working for a company like l oreal  sephora or estee lauder   that s always been a personal passion of mine   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>taking part in the forte foundation s mbalaunch program helped atufunwa navigate the mba admissions process  read on to learn some of what she discovered in the process and the advice she has for future applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what business schools did you apply to  why did you choose them   lisa atufunwa  i applied to emory s goizueta school  vanderbilt s owen graduate school of business  the university of rochester s simon school of business  duke s fuqua school and the university of michigan s ross school of business  i chose them primarily because of the size of the programs  i was not looking for a program that had a large class small medium was my focus  i was also looking for a school that was not necessarily top ten  but that had a strong marketing program  location was a factor as well i would like to try to live in all parts of the united states  and most of the schools i applied to are in the south  which is a region i have yet to visit or live in  finally  speaking to alumni about their experiences also played into where i decided to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how did you hear about forte s mbalaunch program  what did you find most valuable about it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  i heard about it during my initial research into mba programs  i attended an mba fair here in denver  and a lot of the schools there brought it up to me  i had never heard about mbalaunch or forte before  so i did a little bit more research and contacted krystal brooks  who heads the launch program  to learn more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i became a launcher in       what i found most helpful was that it meant i wasn t alone going through the process  i was part of a group of like minded women trying to obtain the goal of becoming an mba candidate  i didn t feel like i was going through this by myself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the resources were also really valuable  we had access to a range of test prep and mba admissions consultants  first hand meetings with admissions officers at many schools and we got to meet with current students who had also gone through the forte program or are forte fellows  these were all very helpful </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what did you most enjoy about the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  writing my essays  i know a lot of people find that the most challenging part of the application process  but i enjoyed digging through my past and pinpointing the stories that i wanted to highlight </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of my favorite webinars as part of the mbalaunch program was delivered by angela guido  she led a session breaking down how to brainstorm and pick topics for your essay  it was very intriguing to see how to take a broad topic and narrow it down to who you are as a person  for example  she took the topic of family and asked everyone if family was a passion  she then broke down this very broad topic into discreet aspects  are you close with your family  why it is important to you  how do you prioritize family  she showed exactly how to take a general topic most applicants would write about and tailor it to who you are as an individual </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for one of my essays i chose to focus on the fact that i am bi cultural  i am nigerian american  in my essay i talked about the difficulties of growing up in two different cultures  for example  i don t speak my parents  native language  which means i am not able to communicate directly with my grandmother  i need to have a parent or relative with me whenever i talk to her  right now i am trying to achieve my goal of learning igbo so that i can talk to her myself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i shared in my essay how that s one of the things i am most proud of  but i also focused on the challenging aspect of learning a new language  highlighting how it has helped prepare me to go back to school for my mba  when you re learning a language  you are in a new territory trying to find your way  which i think offers parallels to what business school will be like </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how was your gmat experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  to be perfectly honest  i did not have a very good gmat experience  i had to take it multiple times  i felt it was the most challenging part of the application process  but the good thing about this time around was that thanks to the forte program i had a study partner  when i first took it was just me studying by myself  but i met a friend as part of my launch group and we ended up studying together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  did schools  female enrollment percentages factor into your decision of where to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  yes  i would say it was a factor into my decision of where to submit my applications  because of forte i did find myself asking a lot more questions about different aspects of how the schools focus on the growth of women applicants and what initiatives they have to help get more women into business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i plan to have continued involvement with forte  i am in constant conversation with krystal  and i am hoping to see if there are any volunteer opportunities i might participate in  i ve also made a point to participate in interviews like these  and i ve been sharing my experience informally with other current applicants as well telling them about forte and why they should sign up for the launch program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  is there anything you would change about the launch program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  actually  forte started an inaugural consulting core  inviting participants to propose ways the program could be made better  it was designed as an opportunity for launchers to get some hands on consulting experience while also giving back first hand  one of the recommendations we came up with was to make the gmat module longer  the mbalaunch program is broken into two different modules  but we felt the gmat section should be extended because the test is a major pain point for many applicants  based on our feedback  this is something forte has already changed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what made you choose to apply as part of round    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la  i initially wanted to apply in round   but i didn t have the gmat score that i thought i needed  so i made the decision to push my applications to round   and take the test again  my advice for future applicants is that that s okay  even if you have a set plan for your application process  it s okay to deviate from that plan if it will help you prepare the strongest possible application </paragraph>

  <title>tops for tech  the best business schools for careers in technology</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>here s a fact you may not have known  several of today s leading technology innovators share one thing in common a montessori education  yep  google s larry page and sergei brin  amazon s jeff bezos  wikipedia founder jimmy wales  and simcity creator will wright were all educated as children using the self directed  hands on  collaborative teaching model developed by italian doctor and educator maria montessori  alas  though  not a single one has an mba so perhaps not a very useful factoid when you re trying to determine the best business schools for a career in technology </paragraph>
    <paragraph>facebook s mark zuckerberg  microsoft s bill gates  apple s steve jobs  michael dell  biz stone of twitter none of them has an mba either  and facebook second in command sheryl sandberg  who does have an mba from harvard business school  is famously on record recently saying the degree isn t necessary for success in tech  nevertheless  a growing tide of students are looking to use business school as their launch pad to successful careers in tech and the top tech firms  including those founded by non mbas  are snapping them up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why  you ask  part of it has to do with the blurring of lines between technology and more traditional business  one no longer exists without the other  as technology becomes central to accessing services and products  period  demand for the skill set of the mba with a technology specialization has become pervasive  facebook needs skilled general managers who understand strategy  operations  marketing and logistics but are more than conversant in tech   increasingly  for that matter  so do most any consumer packaged goods or manufacturing firms  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the same time  some of what draws a growing crop of mbas to technology firms is not completely divorced from montessori  in a      interview with barbara walters  google s co founders attributed their success in part to the latitude they had as young learners to follow their interests and decide for themselves what to learn   i think it was part of that training of not following rules and orders  and being self motivated  questioning what s going on in the world and doing things a little bit differently   page said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in this converging world  as tech companies must increasingly operate like traditional companies and vice versa  there are a handful of business schools that lead the pack in terms of preparing their graduates to land jobs at the top tech firms while also providing the flexibility and self direction that appealed so much to the earlier tech innovators  read on to learn about a few of the very best </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cmu s tepper school of business carnegie mellon university s tepper school of business sends a greater percentage of its graduates to work in the technology industry than any other leading business school a whopping       percent of the class of       consulting  the second most popular industry for tepper grads  draws just    percent  these stats may not come as a surprise to those acquainted with tepper  which has a long history of churning out quant wizzes with tech prowess  even so  it represents significant growth even for the traditionally tech focused school  as recently as       tepper sent just    percent of its grads into tech </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are several aspects of the tepper mba program that set students up for success in the technology field  for starters  any tepper mba student can choose to pursue a specialization in business technology  which combines technical and managerial coursework with experiential learning opportunities  the    faculty members who teach in the business technologies department boast an array of research and expertise between them  from big data and it management to e business and the economics of information systems  there were no fewer than    technology courses on offer this semester  </paragraph>

  <title>business school deposit deadlines  decisions  dilemmas  do tell </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the time has come for many round   applicants to make a decision about where they will attend business school in the fall  monday was the round   deposit deadline at harvard business school  hbs   and tomorrow deposits are due at chicago booth  duke s fuqua school  northwestern s kellogg school  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and yale school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for many  plunking down the cash to indicate to a school that you can t wait to join their mba class is as straightforward as it can be  no doubt there are quite a few triumphant applicants to hbs who sent in their        payments on monday or before with glee  if you were gunning for hbs all along  getting the news you d been accepted was possibly one of the happiest days of your life  and making your first payment felt like an unequivocal investment in your future </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for others  though  having to actually pull the trigger can cause some cognitive dissonance   you ll find some applicants saying   s     now i need to invest     k with significant opportunity cost  is it really worth it    notes clear admit s alex brown  who saw some of this when he worked in admissions at wharton  indeed  coming face to face with the reality of two years of lost income on top of already steep tuition fees is enough to give anyone pause  weighing this personal investment against the long term pay out both professionally and personally is an important process for all prospective business school students  some will have conducted complete return on investment  roi  calculations before even applying  but for others  this step comes later   before this time  all their energy was focused on getting into the best school they could  but now some of that energy is focused on how they will pay for it   brown says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>deposits to hedge your options  let s say  though  that you applied to hbs  chicago booth and wharton  but only chicago booth guaranteed you a seat in its class of       with hbs and wharton putting you on the waitlist  here s where things can get tricky  should you put down        at chicago booth to reserve your spot  even when you re holding out hope that hbs or wharton will accept you off the waitlist   nb  the deposit at booth is broken into two payments  one part due when you accept and a second later in the process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>faced with this scenario  many applicants will simply deposit at one school while waiting to hear from the school they want to attend more  forgoing the earlier deposit if they do indeed get in  brown says   schools know this   he adds  for some applicants  this is absolutely worth the potential loss of a few thousand dollars </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you could also ask for a deposit extension  although it s rarely granted  brown says   some will ask for family reasons say  you re waiting for a partner to get a decision on his or her career or school   he offers   that  of course  is dishonest if the real reason is that you are waiting for hbs   but deposit extension requests that are genuine and for a reason other than hedging your options are more likely to work  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in some cases  an applicant will request a deposit extension because he or she hopes to attend admit weekends at multiple schools to truly assess their fit within the culture   there is no risk to requesting a deposit extension   brown says   if the request is denied  then you simply pay your deposit    it s not like a school can rescind an offer because you asked for more time to make a decision  </paragraph>

  <title>beyonce  red lobster and harvard business school  unlikely bedfellows </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>what do mega star beyonce  seafood chain red lobster and harvard business school  hbs  have in common  for a brief stint earlier today  a little more than usual  an enterprising reporter at boston com stumbled upon a quirky little tidbit of not quite news namely  that typing  red lobster boston  into google maps returned a result suggesting that a branch of the chain restaurant glorified in bey s latest song could be found on the hbs campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s not true   i had no knowledge of this and don t understand how it could happen  because there s no red lobster on this campus   jim aisner  hbs director of media and public relations  told the boston com reporter with a laugh reportedly after typing the search term into the map tool himself and seeing the business school pop up </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>source  boston com</paragraph>
    <paragraph>in case you haven t been following along  beyonce released a new song and video entitled  formation  a day before performing it live at the super bowl halftime  in the song  she sings about taking a man to the sit down seafood chain for post coital cheddar bay biscuits   for what it s worth  she tackles a few weightier issues as well  including race in america  hurricane katrina and police brutality  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to a cnn com report  the restaurant chain saw a    percent increase in sales on sunday over the previous year as a result of the star s surprise endorsement  which occasioned        twitter mentions in a single hour and propelled the brand to trending status for the first time ever   a couple of hours after the halftime show  red lobster tweeted out this gem   cheddar bey biscuits  has a nice ring to it  don t you think   formation  beyonce   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs  for its part  wasn t going to be left out of a potential trending opportunity   as we confirmed this morning  there is no red lobster on campus   sorry  beyonce fans   read the school s twitter feed not long after the boston com story ran </paragraph>
    <paragraph>neither red lobster nor google returned boston com s request for comment on why hbs might have popped up in search results for boston area outposts  as of this writing  the anomaly has been corrected  red lobster s own website offers the following message in response to the same query   we re sorry  there are currently no red lobster restaurants located in your area  we look forward to serving you in the future as we continue to grow and expand across the country  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an hbs case in the making  what remains to be seen is whether more of a true connection could emerge between the former destiny s child star  the lakeland  florida born restaurant chain and the boston business school  will hbs employ its famed case method to examine the marketing phenomenon that unfolded around the super bowl  formation  performance  its biscuit endorsement and red lobster s resulting spike in sales  or perhaps around how red lobster could have made even more of the opportunity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s certainly plausible  in fact  beyonce has made her way into hbs classroom discussion before  an august      case by hbs professor anita elberse and stacie smith examined the december      release of the star s eponymous album  that case dug into the unorthodox release of the album by beyonce s company parkwood entertainment in partnership with sony music s label columbia records without any prior promotion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>elberse  for her part  specializes in studying the power of top tier entertainment stars   she even teaches a course as part of the school s executive education offerings called  business of entertainment  media and sports  bems   in which real celebrities sit side by side with entertainment executives to examine how to turn a star s brand enterprise and influence into profit  according to a forbes piece last week  basketball star dwayne wade  linebacker brandon marshall and supermodel karlie kloss  among other celebs who chose to remain anonymous  have taken part  elberse has used the beyonce case as teaching material in the bems course </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wouldn t it be a coup if elberse could convince bey herself to drop by when she next teaches the bems course  slated for june   to          hbs  that gives you a few months to find a spot for a red lobster on campus </paragraph>

    <paragraph>to help you bide the time as you wait  we thought we d share some of what livewire data told us about wharton s round   applicants  in round       percent of applicants who shared their results via livewire were accepted to the class of       another    percent were rejected  and the remaining   percent were placed on the waitlist  of those who got accepted in round    the average gmat score was     and the average gpa was     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we should note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who were accepted to wharton may have been more likely to share the news publicly  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan alumnus and partner attempt first round the world solar flight</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mit sloan alumnus andre borschberg and balloonist bertrand piccard are currently attempting the first round the world flight using only the power of the sun  both men co founded the solar flight project  named solar impulse  which is based in switzerland </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the aim of the voyage is to travel around the globe at high altitude using no fuel and releasing zero pollutants  the airplane  solar impulse    is constructed from carbon fiber and weighs no more than an average car  with the wingspan of a jumbo jet and the engine power of a small motorcycle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pair completed the first of part of their journey in july of      traversing the pacific from japan to hawaii  traveling       miles over     hours before experiencing battery malfunction and landing in hawaii  they plan to resume flight in april      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while the first flight around the world without the use of fuel is an incredible feat in itself  borcshberg and piccard have greater ambitions outside the act itself  they hope to demonstrate the power of solar energy and inspire others to make use of renewable energy  the poetic ambitions of flying for change are fitting for the two men  who have chosen to pursue innovation beyond the domains of aviation and engineering alone  as if that weren t enough   seeking further to change the world at large </paragraph>
    <paragraph>their website reads  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the environmentally conscious and adventuresome spirit that imbues the men s mission is one of family tradition for bertrand piccard  whose father and grandfather are both famous explorers  bertrand s father  jacques piccard oceanographer and engineer took part in the first exploration of the mariana trench  whereas august piccard  bertand s grandfather  twice claimed the record for highest altitude reached in an air balloon  bertand himself also earned fame for being the first person to fly around the world in a continuous air balloon flight </paragraph>
    <paragraph>given piccard s prior accomplishments and borschberg s    plus years of pilot and aircraft construction experience  one is hard up to imagine a duo more capable of shaping the future </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg marketing students award super bowl win to toyota s prius</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>you may have heard that the denver broncos won the super bowl on sunday and even that the team s star peyton manning became the winningest quarterback in national football league  nfl  history  but according to marketing students at northwestern s kellogg school of management  bragging rights go to toyota for its ad promoting the prius  which ran during the game </paragraph>
    <paragraph>super bowl advertising is big business  according to ad week  advertisers paid as much as    million per    second spot as part of sunday s game  which aired on cbs and drew       million viewers  the prius commercial  entitled  the longest chase   clocked in at one minute and    seconds which based on the ad week figure would add up to more than     million in ad spend </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>for toyota  at least  it was money well spent  according to the    kellogg mba students who scrutinized each ad during the big game as part of the school s   th annual kellogg school super bowl advertising review  led by kellogg professors derek d  rucker and tim calkins  the highly anticipated event draws dozens of students each year eager to put what they re learning as part of their marketing coursework into practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the students employ a strategic framework  which goes by the acronym adplan  to evaluate the effectiveness of each super bowl commercial according to six criteria  attention  distinction  positioning  linkage  amplification and net equity </paragraph>
    <paragraph> toyota s prius was a clear winner in this year s super bowl because it kept our attention  had strong linkage to the brand and showcased its benefits   rucker said in a statement  starring former characters from the television show the wire posing as bank robbers escaping police  the ad pokes fun at the stereotype of the prius as a slow car </paragraph>
    <paragraph>doritos  with an ad depicting a birth induced by a chip eating dad  also received high marks from the kellogg team  as did budweiser  t mobile  audi and turbotax </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maybe not the best spent marketing dollars comedians keegan michael key and jordan peele teamed up to promote website builder and blogging platform squarespace  but the kellogg students deemed that ad a flop  giving it a grade of  f   it marks the second year in a row that squarespace has ranked at the bottom of the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is not a surprise as our panel found it both confusing and lacking a clear point of difference   rucker said  also coming in toward the bottom of the ranking although slightly above squarespace with a  d  grade were acura  apartments com  buick  jublia  lg  persil  sofi and suntrust </paragraph>
    <paragraph> while many advertisers played it safe  our panel found most of the overall advertising worked well with strong branding and many companies communicated a clear point of difference   calkins said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba student courtney firestone was thrilled to take part   as a student  getting to participate in kellogg s super bowl ad review was a great experience to apply what we ve learned in class   she said in a statement </paragraph>

  <title>approaching the mba team based discussion or group interview  advice for wharton        ross interviewees</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>did you receive an invitation to interview as part of round   at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  are you gearing up for an interview at the university of michigan s ross school  in either or both cases  congratulations  now  it s time to prepare for the mba team based discussion  tbd  or group interview  as the schools refer to their unique group evaluations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is the team based discussion  a few years ago  the admissions office at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school partnered with the wharton innovation group to launch a new evaluation method  the team based discussion  tbd   as its name suggests  as part of the tbd  applicants are placed into a group with five to six other applicants for an interactive discussion about real life business scenarios  designed to reveal to the admissions committee how each applicant approaches and analyzes specific situations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our hope is that this will give applicants a glimpse into wharton s group learning dynamic  which is central to our program   karl t  ulrich  vice dean of innovation at wharton  said about the tbd when it launched as part of the         application season   we believe that this type of assessment also serves as a tool to take prospective students  off the page  and allows us to see firsthand the ways in which they can contribute to our community of diverse learners and leaders   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>deputy vice dean of admissions  financial aid and career management maryellen lamb echoed ulrich s sentiments in a post on the school s mba admissions blog   our goal was to give our potential students an opportunity to show us who they are how they think  lead  communicate and interact   she said   at the same time  we wanted our applicants to experience who we are a highly collaborative culture that cultivates persuasive rather than positional leadership  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the way teams of applicants are assembled is simply a function of who signs up when  the school reports   there is no  crafting  done on our end   lamb says  each participant will receive a prompt for the tbd in advance  and wharton recommends spending about an hour in advance preparing for the discussion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the majority of tbd interviews will be held on wharton s philadelphia campus and conducted by admissions fellows  a select group of second year mba students  but tbds will also be held in various cities around the world as part of each round  these sessions will be conducted by admissions officers   on  and off campus team based discussions will be conducted in the same way and considered equally   wharton s website states   there is no  advantage  in choosing either option  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here s the prompt received by applicants who were invited to interview as part of round    identical to the round   prompt  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the diversity of interests and backgrounds of the wharton mba community is reflected in the variety of programs that we support  the african american mba association  private equity and venture capital club  wharton women in business  entrepreneurship club  and the veteran s club are five of the more than one hundred student run clubs here at wharton  each year  many of these clubs run conferences  providing unique and exclusive opportunities for students to engage with business and thought leaders around the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the purpose of this discussion  picture yourself as a core member of a student run club s conference committee  feel free to consider yourself part of an existing club or one that has not yet been created  in this role  you and your team must create and deliver a one day  high impact conference on the topic of your choice keeping in mind that the event s aim is to provide a forum for students  faculty  alumni  thought leaders  and executives to explore and challenge ideas related to the topic at hand  please take a moment to learn more about the current wharton mba student led clubs and conferences </paragraph>
    <paragraph>please come prepared to share your thoughts with the group in one minute or less before moving into the team discussion  you should plan to spend no more than one hour in preparation for this part of the process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  what s the best way to approach the tbd  you ask  we consulted our resident expert  alex brown  who worked in admissions at wharton for several years  here s his take </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  kellogg mbas gear up for super bowl ad review</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s time for the super bowl and at northwestern s kellogg school of management  that means it s also time for the super bowl ad review  brands spend more than    billion each year to advertise their products through super bowl commercials  some more effectively than others  for the   th year running  kellogg marketing students will apply their unique framework for evaluating an ad s brand building potential as part of the      kellogg super bowl ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the players take the field on sunday  more than    kellogg mba students will team up with marketing professors tim calkins and derek rucker to determine the winners and the losers in the battle of the brands  they ll us the adplan framework to evaluate each ad according to six critical criteria  attention  distinction  positioning  linkage  amplifications and net equity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a recent post on the kellogg mba student blog  four students share why they are excited to participate  and for anyone who wants to follow along on game day  the kellogg ad review team will be tweeting live using the hashtag  kelloggsb </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source   the inside perspective   kellogg s mba student blog  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in anticipation of sunday s event  we asked four students why they wanted to participate in the ad review and what they re hoping to take away from this unique experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jillian fishman</paragraph>
    <paragraph>why did you want to participate in the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now that i am recruiting for roles in marketing and branding at kellogg  the super bowl ad review was a unique opportunity to apply a strategic framework to the real world and evaluate advertising objectively  not just whether it tugged at my heartstrings  in addition  several companies debuted ads this year colgate  lg and paypal so it will be fascinating to see whether they can effectively build their brands during the most watched tv broadcast in the u s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you hoping to learn from the experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the cost of advertising continues to skyrocket  the super bowl has become more high stakes than ever  brands need to be able to justify the multi million dollar investment for mere seconds of airtime  for this reason  i was eager to learn kellogg s strategic adplan framework and apply it in real time during the super bowl  it is an honor to be a part of this longstanding kellogg tradition that determines the super bowl s winners and losers  aside from the actual game  of course  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>andrea sanchez ferro</paragraph>
    <paragraph>why did you want to participate in the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>coming from a different region latin america the super bowl ad review is a must experience for me  i consider this event an opportunity to bring a different point of view to the table  grounded in my previous knowledge from working with cpg brands back home  while using the adplan strategic tool that i have learned here at kellogg  i am really looking forward to seeing the impactful ads and messages that many companies want all of the u s  to see during one of the highlight events of the year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you hoping to learn from the experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sharing time with my kellogg peers while learning from top kellogg professors who have a lot of experience with evaluating advertising is really valuable for me </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leslie kwang</paragraph>
    <paragraph>why did you want to participate in the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are many amazing opportunities available at kellogg  but the super bowl ad review is one of the ones that really stand out as a quintessential kellogg tradition  i wanted to participate not only because of the uniqueness of the opportunity  but also because i was interested in being part of something big within the kellogg community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you hoping to learn from the experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the super bowl is the single biggest advertising event of the year when companies spend millions of dollars on a tv spot  under the pressure of high stakes and large viewership  companies go all out on their super bowl ads   and some fly while others flop  i am excited to be part of evaluating these ads and learn what makes a promotion effective  the brand managers and creative agencies that create the super bowl ads are all smart  but why don t some of their ideas don t go as planned  what makes a super bowl ad truly great while another misses the mark  these are the types of questions that i hope to resolve from my experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hannah park</paragraph>
    <paragraph>why did you want to participate in the ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prior to kellogg  i was an account supervisor at grey advertising for the nfl  two of my campaigns aired during the game last year  so i am familiar with how much thought and work goes on behind the scenes  i m excited to be on the other side this year and to analyze the ads from a marketing perspective  part of what makes the kellogg experience so unique is the ability to participate in collaborative and experiential learning opportunities like the super bowl ad review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you hoping to learn from this unique experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>having been so close to the creative in my prior job  this will be a great way to step back and think like a marketer  it s important to not only entertain and break out from the crowd  but to also drive business  i ll be interested to see which brands can seamlessly merge good storytelling with brand positioning  it s the   th super bowl this year  so i m excited to see how marketers will up their game </paragraph>

  <title>livewire analysis reveals strength of rejected hbs round   applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  sent out the second and final wave of interview invites for round   candidates yesterday   a quick analysis of the status updates received on mba livewire in the past    hours suggests that the rejected hbs applicants are incredibly impressive  of the     candidates who shared a status of rejection  the average gmat was     and the average gpa was      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  lessons from the mba livewire data in round   tell us that those making the cut for interviews and ultimately admission do not look terribly different where the raw statistics are concerned  here s a quick recap  roughly one third of round   applicants who reported results on mba livewire received an invitation to interview  among those  reported gpas ranged from     to      with an average of      the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      the ranges and averages were much the same for those who got a rejection  the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all of this to say that hbs has many more qualified candidates than it can possibly accept   at the end of the day  while you clearly need great scores and grades to stay in the running at hbs  the difference comes down to several other factors  like leadership experience  employer caliber  caliber and nature of undergraduate experience  career sector  current location  future plans  outside activities  emotional intelligence  letters of recommendation and ethnic social socioeconomic diversity   notes clear admit co founder eliot ingram </paragraph>

  <title>innovative fund gives columbia business school mba students hands on value investing experience</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>where should you go to business school if you want to pursue value investing  a new student led fund at columbia business school  cbs  established with a       million donation by investment guru thomas russo makes the new york city mba program a good bet </paragraph>
    <paragraph>value investing the philosophy favored by warren buffett  among others  of buying undervalued assets and then exercising patience as their long term fundamentals reveal greater value can be hard for mba students to grasp in a tangible way in the two short years they spend in business school  indeed  most academic research suggests that value investing works best over the long run </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo  a student of buffett s  wants to help groom the next generation of value investors  and so he s created the  x x  student value investment fund to give mba students the real world experience he believes is required </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  five by five by five  arose from my long held belief that students ought to have an opportunity to derive deep and lasting lessons from student investment funds   russo  who is a managing member at gardner russo   gardner llc and an advisory board member for cbs s heilbrunn center for graham   dodd investing  said as part of an article on the cbs website   the biggest lessons occur over time   the fund is  trying to get investors  horizons stretched out beyond five minutes  five days or even five quarters  i want the  x x  portfolio to succeed and underscore the message that long term investing is actually a worthy and profitable pursuit  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo says he chose cbs for the project and not his own alma mater stanford gsb because of the the school s strong legacy of value investing  indeed  the investment paradigm was developed by cbs professors ben graham and david dodd in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the fund s name reflects its unique structure  five students each select funds based on their ability to deliver compound returns over a five year holding period providing five  or fewer  clear  understandable and succinct reasons for their choices </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in investing  you learn by doing   mallory downing  mba      said as part of the news article  downing s recommendation of cummins inc   cmi   a power and automotive equipment manufacturer  was one of the five selected for the first year s portfolio   a lot of our coursework is pitching stocks  but we ve never actually put money behind them  we haven t had to live with them  this is different  sticking with your investment for five years takes a lot of work  it s dealing with the ups and downs  it s so much of a learning experience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>downing s recommendation  along with    others  were selected by professors bruce greenwald and tano santos as part of their spring course   value investing with legends   the fund s investment board voted on five of the    to receive         investments and be included in the portfolio  in addition to downing  the board also chose patrick enriquez fisher  mba      for his selected position in john deere  de   oystein kvaerner  mba      for his selected position in the weir group  weir   richard taddonio  mba      for his selected position in qualcomm  qcom   and brian waterhouse  mba     for his selected position in cdk global  cdk  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in each of the four upcoming years  five new investments will be added  so that the fund will ultimately be comprised of    total investments  when each selected investment reaches the end of its five year holding period  it will be liquidated to provide funding for future  x x  fund participants to invest  investment amounts in year six and beyond will be increased to adjust for inflation  with any additional profits will help fund scholarships for columbia business school students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of participation in the fund  russo has asked that each student commit to returning to cbs each year of their investment s five year holding period to personally interact with newly selected student managers  current year students will benefit from learning how the selections of prior students performed and also receive constructive feedback on their own selections </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we hope students will learn to be long term investors with the full benefit of hindsight as to what has worked and what has not worked from investments selected by their predecessors   meredith trivedi  administrative director of the heilbrunn center  said in the cbs article  networking opportunities between current and prior fund participants will also prove useful to those interested in global value investment management careers  the school hopes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo  greenwald and trivedi  together with    students  will make up the  x x  fund s board  eventually  the students will be those with the most recent stock picks in the portfolio  but since only five students have so far invested  the other five currently on the board were elected by their peers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the opportunity to sit down with people like tom russo and bruce greenwald and have such personal attention is very  very rare  learning from investors like them  on a very intimate basis  has been an unparalleled opportunity   downing said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo hopes the unique nature of the fund will give business school students an opportunity to learn what it s like to invest for the long term   investment funds run by students typically fail       because they typically just focus on investments popular for the short term   he said  driven to find the fastest way to maximize near term results  positions are sold at the end of each term  which means that subsequent students then engage in their own short term portfolio trading   that way of investing reinforces all the worst conduct on wall street   russo said   most importantly  subsequent student participants never gain the benefit of learning from their predecessors  investment mistakes  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russo  whose own son  christopher russo  is a      cbs graduate  reiterated his admiration for the school s value investing legacy   i wanted to respect columbia business school with this gift for the great  education  that has been offered to so many people i have revered within the value investment community over so many years   he said </paragraph>

  <title>tuck students attend december s paris cop    bring climate talks back to campus</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>four mba students from dartmouth s tuck school of business sat front and center for the climate talks in paris  cop     that grabbed the world s attention in december  now those students are back on campus sharing what they learned with their classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  students from tuck have attended five of the past seven climate summits in copenhagen  cancun  doha and warsaw in addition to paris s cop   with professor anant sundaram   honestly  it continues to surprise me that more schools don t do this   he says  but to his knowledge  tuck is alone in having mba students attend  he suspects part of it is inertia the united nations doesn t make it easy to take part  requiring that those who want to attend formally apply for non governmental organization  ngo  observer status  additionally  only a handful of slots are awarded to each ngo  and he suspects that they have gone to students outside of the business schools at places like harvard  columbia or yale </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>sundaram s own interests propelled him to begin teaching a course back in      on business and climate change  which tuck says was the first of its kind to be offered at a u s  business school  today  many leading business schools offer options for students interested in sustainability  from unc s kenan flagler school of business  which features a sustainability concentration  to yale school of management  which offers a joint degree in business and the environment with the yale school of forestry   environmental studies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>corporations  not countries  produce emissions as sundaram sees it and argues in his classes businesses and individuals are the ones that produce emissions that lead to climate change  not countries  corporations must drive change  he continues  by developing efficiency technologies  shifting to renewable energy sources and implementing carbon capture and sequestration systems  the idea to send students to the climate talks was a natural outgrowth of his classes  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>still  the tuck students  presence there surprises many   people always kind of do a double take and say   what is a business school doing here    sundaram says   and i say   who is causing the emissions  corporations  and who are the people that run those companies  mbas   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as he sees it  the careers of today s mba students are going to evolve in a world where two things are true  first  climate change will happen in a far more significant way  and second  there will be a global price on carbon  which will have stunning implications   for these reasons  it makes complete sense to have business school students attend climate talks   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>winning student essays snag spots at summit the program that allows tuck students to do just that is run through the school s center for business   society  interested students there were about    this fall apply to go  each writing an essay about why they should get to take part  the four selected to attend the cop   in paris in december were tuck alumna christine hou  mba      and second year mba students patrick turevon  nell achtmeyer and kelsey maceachern  as official observers at the talks  the students got to waltz in and out of breakout sessions  roundtable discussions and press conferences taking place behind the scenes at the headline making climate negotiations last month </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in one instance  maceachern and achtmeyer found themselves with front row seats to a press conference where former new york city mayor michael bloomberg and bank of england governor mike carney unveiled a new task force charged with developing ways to measure the financial exposure companies have to climate change   for me  it reinforced how important these issues truly are for all types of business leaders  no matter the industry   achtmeyer says   it was certainly one of the most impactful events i attended   </paragraph>

    <paragraph>hbs managing director of admissions and financial aid dee leopold is on record saying that the timing of an interview invitation whether as part of last week s first wave or today s second wave is not a reflection of your candidacy  that said  she didn t address applicant speculation about the significance of interview invite timing head on this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last year  she was a little more direct  here s what she shared then </paragraph>
    <paragraph> how many in each wave  we really don t know yet and that s because we re not actually finished with reading the written applications  so best guess might be     in the first wave and     in the second  i ve said this before  but please don t speculate or develop theories or algorithms about first vs  second  it doesn t work that way  and it has nothing to do with when you submitted  where you live  or the first letter of your last name  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and the year before  she shared this </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i m aware of all the speculation about how many invitations go out in each wave and if certain geographies or backgrounds are more likely to go out in the first vs  second wave  how we split up these waves varies from year to year and to avoid a lot of algorithms being built out there by those with far more sophisticated quant skills than we possess in dillon  i d rather just leave it at  many  and  some   i can assure you that geography and background have nothing to do with the waves it s all about human beings here in dillon reading a lot of applications thoroughly  we devote a great amount of effort to finding the right balance between minimizing your wait time and maximizing the care and attention we give to each application  we are not running your applications through any kind of machine we re reading them  and reading again  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one way or another  you should all know with certainty in a matter of minutes whether you ve made the cut  we re wishing everyone good luck </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a reminder to all  hub cities for round   interviews this year are london  paris  mumbai  dubai  tokyo  menlo park and new york city   remember  where you choose to interview has no bearing on the evaluation process all of our interviews are conducted by members of the admissions board   leopold shared in a recent blog post  she added that even those who interview in a hub city should feel  warmly invited  to take part in campus interview days in boston </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those of you who do get a coveted interview invitation today  don t forget to download the clear admit hbs interview guide or scroll through past applicants  accounts in the interview archive as you prepare </paragraph>

  <title>consulting career prep at nyu s stern school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you want to earn an mba with the end goal of pursuing a consulting career  new york university s stern school of business should be on your radar  stern had    percent of its      graduates accept jobs in the consulting field  furthermore  eight prominent consulting firms hired three or more graduates from the stern school each in       consulting employers include the boston consulting group  mckinsey   company and pricewaterhousecoopers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to prepare its students for these consulting careers  the stern school offers a variety of classroom instruction  extracurricular activities  and career preparation options for its students  to learn more  we contacted roxanne hori  stern s associate dean of corporate relations  career services and leadership development </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how does stern help prepare students for careers in consulting </paragraph>
    <paragraph> nyu stern mba students have access to extensive programming  mentors and networking through the school s office of career development as well as the management consulting association  one of our popular student clubs   said hori </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the management consulting association  which aims to help students prepare for a career in the management consulting industry  offers stern school students corporate presentations  networking events and casing boot camps  the boot camps are designed to help students prepare for and practice casing interviews for consulting roles </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern also has an office of career development to help students manage their career growth  as well as a global alumni network of more than          resume reviews  on campus recruiting and industry panels are regular features of stern school career development  furthermore  students gain access to top consulting firms at a variety of formal and informal events that are held both on campus or hosted by the companies themselves  this gives students the chance to get to know the firms  office culture and find the company that is the best fit for their career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and all of this preparation is paying off  hori noted that  over the past decade  the percentage of graduating full time mba stern school students who accepted consulting jobs has doubled  furthermore  for the most recent graduating class  class of        more students went into consulting than investment banking  the consulting field is increasingly attractive to mba students  and stern school graduates are successfully obtaining consulting jobs in record numbers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what skills do consulting firms value most  and how can stern mba students gain those skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the nature of consulting work is a great match with our student profile   said hori   we seek applicants who possess both strong intellectual and interpersonal strengths what we call iq   eq   she also noted that consultants must be very smart  good with clients and effective managers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she added that many stern school students hone their skills through the stern consulting corps  board fellows program  leadership development program and club leadership roles  the stern consulting corps encourages students to apply classroom knowledge of consulting to clients such as carnegie hall  city harvest and the william j  clinton foundation  meanwhile  the leadership development program offers students personalized leadership and experiential learning opportunities to help them grow as business leaders </paragraph>
    <paragraph>again  this extensive preparation pays off career wise </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the consulting firms acknowledge the value of this winning combination by hiring our students   said hori </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what makes consulting jobs so appealing in today s job market </paragraph>
    <paragraph> consulting roles are intellectually demanding  consist of rotating short term engagements and require a quick ramp up period   said hori   as a result  management consultants are pushed to learn at a faster pace compared to other industries and functions  embrace diverse subject matter  be nimble and adapt readily to change  </paragraph>

  <title> fridays from the frontline  yale som mba student tests his mettle on shark tank</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week in fridays from the frontline we re featuring an exclusive interview with shaan patel  a    year old  second year mba student at yale school of management  som  who tonight will appear on abc s shark tank  patel  who is taking a two year leave of absence from medical school to get his mba  also runs a company on the side that helps high school students prepare for the sat and act college entrance exams  the las vegas native launched the company called      expert sat prep to teach others the strategies that helped him achieve his own perfect      sat score </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  he shares how business school prepared him for shark tank and why he thinks the mba is a valuable path for entrepreneurs  he also offers tips for business school students who want to try their hand at getting on the show   even thought he had to wait in line for nine hours for the casting call missing a pitch competition taking place back on campus as a result he thinks it was worth it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though his shark tank episode taped in june  he s contractually prohibited from sharing how things went when he pitched to the panel of formidable business tycoons  will he get the venture capital he needs to transform a small business into something big  or will he have to keep bootstrapping  if you re curious  tune in tonight at   p m  est to find out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  tell us about your business  what does it do and how did it get started </paragraph>
    <paragraph>shaan patel  i founded a test prep company that runs six week sat and act prep courses in    cities across the country and online  the way it started was actually a really circuitous path  i never planned to start a test prep company  back when i was in high school i studied quite a bit for the sat myself after initially getting an average score  i ended up getting a perfect score a feat achieved by only     percent of students  it really changed my life i got into great schools  was offered scholarship money and even got to meet the president </paragraph>
    <paragraph>initially i set out to write a book  i pitched     publishers with a book proposal but was turned down  i had all this material and was wondering what to do with it  and so i decided to teach a course  the courses ended up being very successful resulting in an average score improvement of     points  that s pretty unheard of and can really change someone s life </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think it was so successful in part because i know some of the roadblocks  challenges and thought processes students have when approaching the test inappropriately  i was in their shoes  i have also learned some tricks along the way  here s an example of a strategy that i teach that i have never seen taught anywhere else  if you see the word  being  in an sat answer choice  it s probably an incorrect response  i instruct my students to just get rid of answers that have the word  being  in them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i have also developed a template for students to follow so they can prepare in advance for the writing portion of the test  without knowing the topic  they can practice this template and be prepared to tackle the written portion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we really just make things really simple for them to understand  that s why our courses work for students starting at any level  honestly  i have spent more time developing the material thousands of hours than i did even studying myself  and i was the perfect score sat student who studied in the library all the time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  describe your path to business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sp  my path to business school is probably different than most  i have already completed three years of medical school at usc  i then took a two year leave of absence to complete business school at yale school of management  som   i am almost done with business school  and then i ll return and finish my last year of med school at usc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there was a dual purpose to my decision to take a leave of access from med school  first  my business was growing organically in vegas  and i was in med school and so didn t have a lot of time to focus on it or think about expanding  also  i was a bio premed major in college  not a business major  i thought business school would help me learn how to scale my business  second  as a medical student  i wanted to learn more about healthcare management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale som has been great for me  there is a great entrepreneurship community that is really growing there  the new building evans hall is also magnificent  it s really a great place to be  and there are also a lot of cool healthcare opportunities and chances to collaborate with the yale school of medicine </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how did business school prepare you for shark tank </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sp  i am very involved in entrepreneurship classes and in the startup community at yale  one of the great things about business school is that students interested in entrepreneurship pitch a lot  i have had tons of practice pitching ideas and learning how to make them as succinct as possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one really tangible way business school helped me prepare for shark tank was perfecting my    second pitch  you have only    seconds to impress the casting call director in order to get a call back  i spent hours with my fellow business school students practicing my pitch  and it paid off  something like        people a year audition for shark tank and only     end up getting on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how did yale som in particular prepare you for shark tank </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sp  one of the most significant classes that i have taken at som was a management software development course taught by kyle jensen  it taught me the importance of lean methodolgy as it applies to agile development of software  as a result of that class  i decided it was important to have a web developer on our staff  which helped create a better user experience both for visitors to our website and for people who enroll and take our classes  this will also be particularly important when shark tank airs  we expect at least         hits after seven million people watch me on the show </paragraph>

  <title>    million alumni gift to expand  rename wharton leadership program</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>believing firmly that leadership can be both taught and learned  wharton alumna anne welsh mcnulty  mba      has pledged     million to the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania to expand its efforts to train leaders who impact the world  in recognition of this generous gift  the wharton leadership program  launched    years ago  will be renamed the anne and john mcnulty leadership program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcnulty met her late husband john  mba      well before they were classmates at wharton  they both grew up in philadelphia and were sweethearts at cardinal o hara high school  but it was wharton that would train them to become leaders  before his sudden death of a heart attack in       john rose through the ranks at goldman sachs to become partner  then co head of the asset management division and ultimately to lead the creation of its investment management division  anne  previously a managing director at goldman and a senior executive of its hedge fund strategies group  today is the co founder and managing partner of jbk partners  an investment management firm and private philanthropic foundation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we didn t have leadership classes per se when we were at wharton  but you learned by example   she recalls   the biggest change was suddenly being exposed to people from not only around the country but around the world   she says   it changed the context in which you thought about problems  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an inherent belief that leadership can be learned and taught  the most important thing about wharton is that there is an inherent belief there that leadership can be learned and can be taught   she continues   though some of us may think there are natural leaders in preschool  generally people can learn and get better at it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the newly christened anne and john mcnulty leadership program is founded on that very idea and employs a unique combination of coursework  coaching and experiential learning to help its students develop leadership skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the wharton approach first of all is about presenting the core concepts and the foundational research that exists in the realm of leadership and teamwork   says jeff klein  who has served as executive director of the wharton leadership program for the past    years   we begin by getting students familiar with it  and then we work on getting them into situations where they can test their ability and effectiveness as leaders  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton also encourages students to surround themselves with coaches  mentors and trusted colleagues  klein says   leadership is a social experience the process of learning and developing needs to occur with other people  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>seek and accept stretch experiences believing in a  learn by doing  philosophy  klein and his team tells every student to seek and accept stretch experiences   you will hear students say   well  my stretch this semester is i am going to serve as the non profit board fellow for a local philadelphia organization    he says  others might lead student trips to climb a mountain in the andes or trek antarctica   if we have number one  the scholarship  and number two  the coaching  we get such impact from putting students into situations where they put these ideas into practice  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcnulty s gift will allow wharton to continue to expand and innovate in the field of leadership education while also adapting processes that have been successful in the mba program  such as the wharton leadership ventures and the executive coaching and feedback program  to new students and the public   it will also raise awareness of our approach   klein says   the school believes that this approach to leadership development is significant and has implications for leadership development around the world   </paragraph>

  <title>livewire data provides insights into hbs interview invitation results</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with round   interview invitations imminent at harvard business school  hbs   we decided to look back at what happened in round   for a little perspective  clear admit livewire reports gave us the following insights </paragraph>
    <paragraph>roughly one third of round   applicants to hbs who reported results on livewire shared that they received an invitation to interview  among those  reported gpas ranged from     to      with an average of      the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      notably  the ranges and averages were much the same for those who got a ding   the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of        after those round   interviews were conducted  here s what the data revealed </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>reported gpas for those who were admitted to the class of      at hbs ranged from     to      with an average of       the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      for those waitlisted  the ranges and averages were much the same   the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>those who didn t make the cut  meanwhile  had gpas between      and      average        and gmat scores between     and      average        those rejected from hbs were at least in good company representing    percent of livewire reports  acceptances accounted for    percent  and waitlisted applicants comprised the remaining    percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we should note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who were accepted to hbs may be more likely to share the news publicly  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t forget to look to livewire at    noon today  when invitations are slated to go out  good luck and let us know how it goes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and for those of you who got accepted to hbs in round    don t forget to check out decisionwire  our new tool that let s you share where you decide to enroll after everything s said and done </paragraph>

  <title>hbs launches new competition to improve precision medicine clinical trials</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>     billion and more than a decade of trials that s what it takes for a typical precision medical therapy to gain fda approval  the health care initiative at harvard business school  hbs   an alliance of mba students  alumni  faculty and practitioners  is hoping to drastically reduce both the time and expense of getting innovative therapies to market with a new competition designed to reimagine the clinical trials process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>precision medicine  a growing movement in patient care  allows scientists and physicians to use genomic and other information to understand diseases based on their biological mechanisms  enabling them to precisely diagnose and develop tailored treatments  the precision trials challenge  announced today  invites ideas from the medical  science  business and patient communities for ways to reinvent the clinical trials process  the goals  more rapid innovation  better targeted medicine and more effective treatments </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs is leading the charge as opposed to  say  harvard medical school  because the greatest challenges facing precision medicine are business challenges  according to hbs professor richard hamermesh   how can we develop business models that support the advancement of precision medicine  how can we get new therapies to market faster and at a lower cost  our precision trials challenge will help answer these questions by encouraging conversation and helping to put leading edge ideas into practice   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the competition is open to anyone  and applications will be accepted until march           one winner and two runners up chosen by a panel of judges will share          in prizes  and the winner will get to present his or her idea at the      personalized medicine conference  a winner will be announced in april </paragraph>
    <paragraph>funding for this new competition comes from the kraft endowment for advancing precision medicine  established last fall by a     million gift from the kraft family foundation under the leadership of its president  robert k  kraft  myra kraft  robert s wife  died of ovarian cancer in       and the family hopes through its support to help save others  lives by accelerating breakthroughs in precision medicine </paragraph>

  <title>choosing a business school for entrepreneurship</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>typing  startups are hard  into google returns approximately    million results ranging from  startups are hard in     different ways  to     reasons startups are     ing hard   perhaps that has a little something to do with why more and more savvy entrepreneurs are choosing top business schools as their training ground </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with expanding entrepreneurship curricula  cool campus startup accelerators and ever increasing numbers of business plan competitions to say nothing of the all important access to powerful networks of potential investors the mba is becoming the preferred path for many would be founders </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it stands to reason that business schools would become startup hotbeds  especially those that share a few key traits  namely a campus wide culture of collaboration and innovation  institutional support for programs that encourage technology research and interdisciplinary collaboration  and a location near a technological hub  combine these ingredients and stir  the result is a self catalyzing cycle in which campus support for commercializing technology generates local technology startups  which then draw more skilled technologists and managers to the area  who in turn provide the human resources needed to commercialize additional technologies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not surprisingly  business schools that offer some of the most robust programs to support entrepreneurship among students and alumni include those like stanford graduate school of business and uc berkeley s haas school in silicon valley  mit sloan school of management  harvard business school and babson college s f w  olin graduate school of business in the biotech hub of boston  and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  nyu stern and columbia business school along the pharmaceutical corridor between philadelphia and new york city </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but make no mistake  entrepreneurship is on fire  and even schools outside of these hubs are expanding entrepreneurial offerings in a bid to attract the next warby parker or rent the runway founders  the university of michigan s ross school of business  for example  got every first year mba student into the startup mindset by challenging them all to a business plan competition as part of orientation  northwestern s kellogg school launched an accelerator for student startups called the garage last june in a parking garage on campus  and just yesterday  ucla anderson celebrated the launch of its own anderson venture accelerator </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the pages that follow  we ll offer snapshots of the entrepreneurial programs at a few of the business schools leading the charge to support entrepreneurial students be it through courses  student clubs  business plan contests  startup incubators  mentoring programs or some combination thereof  and in the weeks ahead  look for our new series  entrepreneurship   where we ll dig deeper to uncover other ways leading business schools are supporting the founders of tomorrow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs s rock center serves as home base for entrepreneurs in an article entitled  mba programs that get you where you want to go   the new york times last spring named hbs the place to go if you want to start your own company  citing its    entrepreneurial courses     entrepreneurship professors and an annual new venture competition that awards more than          in cash and in kind prizes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and that just scratches the surface of what s on offer  supported by the arthur rock center for entrepreneurship  hbs also boasts an entrepreneurs in residence  eir  program that brings seasoned entrepreneurs and investors to campus for year long counseling engagements  the rock      a network of high impact early stage alumni entrepreneurs willing to share experiences with each other and current students  a summer fellows program that provides financial support to mba students who choose to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities between their first and second years  and a loan reduction program that awards one time  need based loan reductions between         and         to students committed to pursuing their own for profit entrepreneurial ventures upon graduation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there s also the rock accelerator program  which supports    to    founding teams each year with up to        in seed capital to apply the lean start up methodology toward developing a minimum viable product and testing out their value proposition or business model  over the course of two    week terms  teams consult with student and professional mentors  attend peer exchange workshops and focus on rapid prototyping in a race toward a final demo day wrap up session  where they share what they ve learned </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and just this month  hbs added yet another new offering to its entrepreneurial bag of tricks  with the opening of the hbs startup studio in new york city  designed to double as a co working space for eight to    hbs alumni ventures and a meeting place for hbs alumni involved in the nyc startup ecosystem  the startup studio opened in a temporary midtown location until its       square foot silicon alley space is ready later this spring  to apply  companies must have at least one hbs alumni founder  at least          in seed funding and no more than seven employees </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs s efforts to incubate successful ventures seems to be paying off  a february      analysis published by seed stage venture capital investment firm nextview ventures identified more than     founders from the hbs classes between      and       together they ve raised more than      billion for the    companies they ve launched between them  among them are u s  based e commerce trailblazers rent the runway and blue apron  health insurance disruptor oscar and an uber competitor for southeast asia called grabtaxi </paragraph>

  <title>wharton adds online specializations in entrepreneurship  financial modeling</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>touting its pioneering role in the massive online education space  the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania this week announced that it will add two new online specializations to its series of coursera offerings  one in entrepreneurship and another in business and financial modeling  this brings the school s total to    individual online courses making up four distinct specializations  more specializations than any other business school on the coursera platform  the school notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton blazed a trail in      as the first business school to offer a massive open online course  mooc   and again in      as the first to offer an online specialization  that specialization   business foundations   includes courses in marketing  accounting  finance and operations  which form the bedrock of a wharton mba  to date  more than     million students around the globe have enrolled in wharton s online offerings  says anne trumbore  director of wharton online   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school also boasts the largest number of certificates awarded to students online  with more than        going through the additional identification verification steps to certify their completion of a wharton course  trumbore adds   we have really been just thrilled with the response globally   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chance to identify unique talent why is wharton working so hard to deliver its course content to the world for free    we have the ability to provide the wharton learning experience at scale  and we feel that it is our duty to share this world class education   trumbore says  in a video about wharton online  dean geoffrey garrett cites the same primary motivation and adds two more  the opportunity to innovate with technology and a chance to draw the best students to wharton from wherever they are in the world   we probably can t always find the very best students   he says   i think that our online specializations give us the chance to identify some unique talent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  approximately    of the     students who completed the  business foundations  specialization capstone project in its first round will be offered an admissions fee waiver to apply next fall as part of wharton s round   mba application cycle  while far from a guarantee of admission  the fee waiver demonstrates wharton s commitment to helping the strongest of its online students have an opportunity to become on campus students  and for those who successfully navigate the competitive admissions process  wharton will also award up to five         scholarships </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the final course in wharton s second specialization   business analytics   was only launched last week  so students haven t had an opportunity to take part in a capstone project and no reward has been designated for the highest performers  trumbore says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>top entrepreneurship students to score audience with vcs the new  entrepreneurship  specialization announced today will also offer a reward to the top online performers  the learners with the top scores on the capstone project will be introduced to the most appropriate venture capital  vc  firms in wharton entrepreneurship s network  according to region and sector </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the process to select these students will mirror the one used for the  foundations  specialization   students will be peer reviewed they will use a rubric developed by the professors to evaluate one another   trumbore says  the teaching staff will hand grade the highest scoring of this lot to identify an elite group to present to the entrepreneurship professors  who will make introductions to appropriate vcs  she continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>entrepreneurship was a natural next addition to wharton s coursera offerings given the school s deep history of innovation and entrepreneurial success stories such as indian online marketplace snapdeal and online eyeglass retailer warby parker  trumbore says   we also have some of the world s best professors  so it seemed like that would be a really good specialization to bring to a global audience   its courses will tackle key topics in the conception  design  organization and management of new ventures and be taught by superstars on the wharton faculty  including karl ulrich  lori rosenkopf  kartik hosanger  david hsu  david bell  laura huang and ethan mollick </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton s not worried about cannibalization that is  online learners eating into a population of students who might otherwise apply to and enroll in the school s premier two year mba program   i really don t think that someone who has the commitment to even consider coming to an mba program for two years would be satisfied with a    week course of study online   trumbore says   they are just very different types of learners   the more likely outcome  she says  is that the specialization will draw people who have an entrepreneurial idea they want to develop  who then decide they want to apply for the full mba program   it s not an  either or  situation   she says </paragraph>

  <title> insead knocks hbs from top spot in financial times      global mba rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>insead jumped three spots to claim no    in the financial times      global mba rankings  released today  knocking reigning harvard business school  hbs  to no     the global business school which features campuses in france  singapore and abu dhabi has been on an upward trajectory over the past few years  sidling from sixth to fifth to fourth  but this year marks the first time it has claimed the top spot   incidentally  it s also the first one year mba program to ever do so  hbs  for its part  held steady at no    each of the past three years and has taken top honors six times since the ft s rankings debuted in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs wasn t the only school displaced by insead s upward climb  london business school  lbs  was knocked back down to third from the second place spot it claimed last year  the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania also backslid a spot  to fourth  and stanford graduate school of business  which shared fourth with insead last year  fell to fifth   the ft compiles its annual global mba rankings based on two surveys  one of the business schools themselves and another of their alumni   for this year s rankings  alumni who graduated in      were surveyed   based on the responses to these surveys  the mba programs are ranked according to the career progression of their alumni  the school s idea generation and the diversity of students and faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the average salary for insead alumni three years out from graduation was           amounting to almost double     percent  pre mba salary  the other schools in the top five were in roughly the same ballpark on both measures  but insead left them in the dust in terms of  value for money   here the difference between insead s one year program requiring less time out of the workforce and lower program fees and the other top schools  two year programs was stark  insead ranked   th overall for value  while the four runners up were all in the bottom quarter  insead  which calls itself  the business school for the world   also ranked well for its international course experience  fifth  and for the international mobility of its graduates  third  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>across all schools  mba graduates from the class of      earned an average salary of          three years after graduation  up just slightly from last year s           but the pay increase associated with completing the degree jumped more significantly  graduates surveyed as part of this year s rankings reported earning an average of    percent more three years out than at the start of their programs  compared to    percent last year  seven schools reported average salary increases of more than     percent  contributing to the jump  still  it s off from past pay hikes  which reached a high of     percent in      and      and     percent as recently as      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>insead s top performance aside  u s  schools dominated the rankings much as they have in past years  accounting for    of the     schools in the global list  that said  this year s list did include nine new entries from six countries  and global schools have a strong foothold among the top     with insead and lbs joined by spain s iese and ie  as well as china s ciebs and hkust  the united kingdom s judge school of business and france s hec paris </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  those of us here at clear admit encourage prospective applicants to use a school s performance in these and other rankings as just one of many measurements to determine the mba program that will best fit your individual needs </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  triumphant reapplicant gains admission at ucla anderson</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>if at first you don t succeed  try  try again  our fridays from the frontline contributor this week took these words to heart  reapplying in fall      after an unsuccessful application process the year before  a young female indian engineer  she had relatively strong scores and grades  but not a ton of experience under her belt  read on to learn some of the steps she took to strengthen her application the second time around gaining admission at ucla anderson </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while happy to share her story with the clear admit audience  she wants to remain anonymous until she actually matriculates  so until then  we ll just refer to her as the pull that mba trigger blogger   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  pull that mba trigger </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what changed this time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>okay  so let s look at the cold  hard facts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my gmat score stayed the same       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my gpa is the same as well        </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the last time i checked  i was still an indian engineer </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my work experience moved up from about    months to    months </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my job title is now  product manager  and not the dreaded  software engineer  it was before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my post mba goal looks legit now because i have the experience to back it up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a senior colleague at my new job wrote what i can only assume was a stellar letter of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>let me tell ya  i had to work my butt off to transition from being a code monkey to someone making actual product decisions  i must have applied to nearly a     places and interviewed at about    until i finally got the job i wanted  but i persevered because i knew that mba or not  this was where i wanted my career to go </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i guess the lesson here is  don t let the fact that you got rejected bring you down  if you are a reapplicant like i was   the lofty goals that you d written about in your essay  you can still get closer to achieving them without an mba  by self selection  most applicants are ambitious  go getters who honestly don t need an mba to get where they want to go  of course  if you still think business school is right for you  then your application will be stronger than it ever was before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>apart from switching jobs  i also narrowed down my goals even further  previously  my short term goal was to  work in company x as a pm   i changed that to  work in company x s y division as a pm   i backed it up with very relevant experience that i had and tied it in neatly to my long term goal  i m sure it wasn t a huge distinction  but it became super relevant during my interview  where surprisingly enough i spoke to a second year student who had a ton of knowledge about my field of interest  odd because it s quite a niche area   i believe that this worked in my favour since i was immediately able to establish common ground and our conversation centered more around the latest developments in that industry than the usual  tell me how you   stuff </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  in my reapplicant essay  i called out what i believed were the weaknesses in my application  i addressed the age work experience thing head on  i made a stronger connection between my short term and long term goals and finally  i mentioned in passing the gazillion students  alums and admissions officers i d spoken to over an entire year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  i do want to caveat this by saying that i did pretty much the same things i mentioned above in my reapplication to fuqua as well  but surprise surprise  i got dinged without an interview  there is a pretty big element of luck involved  plus the relative quality and composition of the applicant pool  so there is no  fool proof  method to this madness  it s just doing the best you can and hoping for the best </paragraph>

  <title> hbs hypes gender initiative launched last spring</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  today took to its mba voices blog to introduce the hbs gender initiative to those who may not be familiar with it  established in fall       the initiative s public launch took place in may       coinciding with the release of interesting research coming out of hbs related to gender issues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that research included a study published last spring by hbs professor kathleen mcginn that pinpointed advantages enjoyed by children of working mothers  surveying        adults in    countries  she and her colleagues found that the daughters of working mothers completed more years of education  had higher rates of employment and were more likely both to supervise others and earn higher incomes than those of moms who stayed at home in a staggering    of the    countries studied  sons of working moms  while their careers were not measurably impacted  were found to contribute more time each week to childcare and housework which research has shown to increase women s involvement in the workforce and perhaps impact the stability of marriages   there are very few things  that we know of  that have such a clear effect on gender inequality as being raised by a working mother   mcginn said in a statement when the research was released </paragraph>
    <paragraph>later that same month  hbs senior associate dean for culture and community robin ely released her own research on the toll that a      work culture takes on families and gender equality   these      work cultures lock gender inequality in place  because the work family balance is recognized primarily as a women s problem   ely told the new york times   the very well intentioned answer is to give women benefits  but it actually derails women s careers  the culture of overwork affects everybody  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gender initiative seeks to bring research findings to bear on discussions of gender ely leads the new gender initiative at hbs  which is designed to bring together precisely this type of research taking place at harvard and help ensure its dissemination throughout the hbs community  placing this rigorous research at the fingertips of hbs s students will equip them to ground discussions about gender in fact  helping people make better informed decisions as they relate to themselves  their families  their companies and their communities  ely said in may </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on a grander scale  the gender initiative s mission is  to accelerate the advancement of women leaders and promote gender equity in business and society   according to the recent mba voices blog post  but recognizing that gender shapes the lives of both men and women and often intersects other axes of inequality race  ethnicity  class  sexual orientation  to name but a few those involved with the initiative view their work as extending beyond simply addressing women s underrepresentation in leadership </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to supporting related research and its dissemination  the gender initiative will also focus on course development  case writing and building a community devoted to advancing women leaders and gender equity  a conference that in fact predated the gender initiative the gender   work symposium  held each spring will help with the community building  bringing together academics and practitioners to share research and ideas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition  the gender initiative is working to develop new ways to share insights via video  print and social media  its webpage serves as a central repository  the initiative is also leading a major  ongoing study of the career and life paths hbs alumni choose  called  life and leadership after hbs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to today s post on the mba voices blog  one of the greatest challenges facing the hbs gender initiative s efforts are stereotypes that misinform public opinion about gender   unfortunately  much of the conventional wisdom about gender and other identity categories are rooted in stereotypes and other beliefs that are not supported by the evidence   read the post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as an example  the research released last may by hbs s mcginn showing clear advantages for children of working mothers flies in the face of still prevalent perceptions that the increase in working moms is bad for society  indeed  a recent pew research study found that    percent of adults held the negative view  compared to only    percent who saw more working moms as a positive  these kinds of discrepancies between public opinion and fact borne out by research are precisely what the gender initiative hopes to combat </paragraph>
    <paragraph> grounding the conversation about diversity in rigorous research is essential to moving forward and making meaningful progress in our organizations and society more broadly   read today s post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the hbs gender initiative has the staunch support of hbs dean nitin nohria  nohria  appointed in      by drew gilpin faust  harvard s first ever female president  has pledged since joining the business school to help redefine gender relations on campus  in january       nohria promised to increase the number of female protagonists in hbs case studies from   to    percent by      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when the gender initiative launched publicly last spring  he noted hbs s leadership role in defining the roles and functions of business and effective business practice   with the launch of this initiative  we want to have a similar and lasting impact on the way the world understands and acts upon gender related matters   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stay tuned for subsequent posts  in which we ll drill down to see whether and how the hbs gender initiative is measurably changing the experience of mba students at the school as well as what other leading business schools are doing as they square off against the issue of gender equity </paragraph>

  <title>darden partners with bunker labs dc to support veteran led companies</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>making up between seven and nine percent of the mba class each year  military veterans are a significant part of the university of virginia darden school of business fabric   veterans enrich our learning community   wrote darden professor and dean emeritus bob bruner in a veteran s day blog post a few years back   we actively seek excellent students from the ranks of the military   that s because like other leading business schools  darden recognizes that many skills honed in the military such as leadership  discipline  teamwork and decision making transfer seamlessly to the mba classroom </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but why stop at the mba classroom  as part of a pilot program launched last semester  darden faculty  alumni and second year mba students have partnered with a veteran focused business accelerator to offer entrepreneurship training to veteran led companies in and around washington  dc  led by darden professor greg fairchild  a rotating group of alumni and students started teaching entrepreneurship courses at bunker labs dc in august  seven veteran led businesses graduated from the program in december  and a new cohort will start in february </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the child of a career army artillery office  fairchild has first hand insight into both the challenges veterans can face and the unique strengths they can bring to bear as entrepreneurs   i knew that  basically  things were challenging for veterans  more than most people recognize   fairchild said in an article on the darden website   on the other hand  i knew that it was a population that includes people who move people and machinery and have led  and so you can see the ways that people who are veterans make a lot of sense as business people  and more specifically as entrepreneurs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fairchild  who also teaches entrepreneurship courses with darden students to inmates in area prisons  is always looking for ways to broaden the darden circle   this is what we re about in terms of bringing high quality education to people who are really at a life inflection point   he said as part of the article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden network helps launch capitol post bunker labs is housed at capitol post  an organization designed to unite the dc veteran business community  capitol post director emily mcmahan  a      graduate of darden s executive mba program  was approached by fellow emba classmate stephanie landrum  president and ceo of the alexandria economic development partnership  to launch the organization   when i met emily  she had already made her transition from military service to entrepreneurship and as cfo  i saw how she used the darden curriculum to help grow the company   landrum said in the darden website article   with her background as a veteran  an entrepreneur and a darden grad  i knew she was the perfect person to help design  build and launch the program  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to landrum  capitol post evaluated a number of programs as potential partners for running the entrepreneurship courses before choosing darden   we were very excited to find a way to include darden and work with the faculty and students to customize some of the best parts of our darden experience to now share with the veteran business owners we are working with   landrum said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcmahan stressed to the seven companies in the initial cohort that it was a pilot program   we have a product and an offering  and we told them we would be tweaking it   she said as part of the darden website article   for our next class in february  we are really excited for the programming and line up of companies we ve attracted  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to mcmahan  bunker labs is seeking startups led by veterans or veteran spouses that have an innovative concept and address a clear market need  the hope is that with the accelerator s support  they will grow into sustainable  scalable businesses  while intended as a resource for the veteran community and active duty military  the next cohort will also include a few civilian led startups </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among those companies in the first cohort were one startup designed to help military families find places to live and another that helped train schools to prepare for and handle threatening situations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applying the case method to real life businesses using the case method darden is known for  the student instructors teach the participating entrepreneurs business concepts and theory  which they can then immediately put into action in their businesses   it s amazing to be able to bring darden to a program where the rubber meets the road   said mcmahan   they re really applying what they learn from these cases in the now  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fairchild agrees   these people are really dealing with real things   he said   we ve worked closely with emily on figuring out how to get the right mix of theory and case and workshop  but i think we have a great partner who s open to learning how to do that best  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second year mba student bryan yoon  one of the current teachers in the program  is also a veteran himself  having spent eight years as an intelligence officer in the u s  army before coming to darden  a member of the darden military association  he appreciates the opportunity to remain connected and give back to fellow veterans   there s a particular set of experiences and a vernacular that accompany those experiences that only the people in that room are going to be able to understand  and there s a unique opportunity to connect that to businesses   he said in the darden piece </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fairchild hopes the program will only continue to grow  aided by the large veteran population in washington  which provides a rich talent pool </paragraph>

  <title>new mba decisionwire feature debuts on clear admit</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>for all the devoted livewire followers out there  we ve got some exciting news to share  clear admit this week has added a new feature designed to let mba applicants  students and alumni share more information with their peers specifically where they decide to attend business school based on where they applied and were accepted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this new tool  called mba decisionwire  provides profiles and school selection information updates in real time from your peers as they make the all important decision of where to actually pursue their mba  users can filter others  submissions by the schools applied to  admitted to and enrolled at  as well as by application year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of the people who got into both harvard and stanford in round    where are most ultimately planning to go  how does that compare to previous years  when deciding between columbia  nyu stern and chicago booth for investment banking  who chooses which school  how many schools did other applicants apply to  of those  how many did they gain admission to  these are but a few of the data points decisionwire helps you extract </paragraph>
    <paragraph>decisionwire also invites those who submit to share their gpa and gmat scores  as well as their intended post mba career  a notes section lets people include any factors that may have influenced their final decision  such as financial aid  size of student body  location or a given school s track record for placing graduates in a chosen industry  in essence  each entry will tell an individual s story from starting the application process to setting foot on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though only just launched  decisionwire has already drawn dozens of submissions revealing a range of interesting details   culture fit was a deciding factor for me as was sloan s emphasis on entrepreneurship   wrote a      applicant focused on tech who enrolled at mit sloan after applying to haas  hbs  mit sloan and stanford gsb and gaining admission to all but stanford </paragraph>
    <paragraph> london is just an amazing city that i d love to spend     years living in not to mention the networking opportunities   wrote an applicant from this year who has enrolled at london business school  choosing it over cambridge s judge school of business and hec paris  which also offered him or her admission </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another applicant from this year applied to dual degree programs at each fuqua  ross and kellogg   chose northwestern s jd mba   the candidate shared   ultimately  business school ranking and career opportunities were the greatest influencer despite having received very generous scholarship opportunities from duke and michigan  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we re thrilled to launch decisionwire and hope you ll enjoy using it  of course  it stands to grow even more interesting and valuable as more submissions roll in  a frequently asked questions page provides additional information about the tool  but if you have any additional questions or feedback  please contact dw clearadmit com </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontlines  kellogg mbas take silicon valley</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>welcome back to fridays from the frontlines  where each week we feature the perspectives of current mba applicants  students and recent alumni wherever they are in the trajectory of business school  today we re pleased to feature a post from luke murphy  a first year mba candidate at northwestern s kellogg school of management  who recently led a group of fellow students on a trek to san francisco startups  he was a good one to help organize the trip  having grown up in the bay area and worked there for years before business school  most recently as director of business development at nasdaq in san francisco  but as you ll see in the post that follows  even he was surprised by some of what the trip revealed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though places like stanford graduate school of business and uc berkeley s haas school provide some distinct advantages to those targeting silicon valley as a post mba career destination  kellogg s trek and others like it organized by schools elsewhere in the country and the world help make this attractive industry attainable to a wide array of graduates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  the inside perspective  kellogg s full time mba student blog   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>behind the scenes with san francisco startups over thanksgiving break this year  i helped lead a group of    kellogg mba students to visit eight startup companies in san francisco  zenefits  nerdwallet  stitchfix  dropbox  hoteltonight  doubledutch  toutapp and instacart  the trip was a way for us to learn about the well known silicon valley startup culture  network with employers and squeeze in sightseeing of a city many students had never visited </paragraph>
    <paragraph>raised in the bay area and having worked in san francisco for the previous six years  i thought i knew what to expect from the meetings we set up  i expected   and did hear   terms like    x thinking  challenge conventional wisdom  no competition  industry disruption and ride together die together  seriously   but there were also themes that surprised me  here are a few </paragraph>
    <paragraph>value of an mba before going to business school  i read countless articles about whether to get an mba before joining a startup  many said the best route is to dive right into a startup and  learn by doing   thus  i was surprised to hear that almost all the startups we visited were actively hiring mbas  in fact  many of the executives we met with also came from the consulting industry  we were told the demand for mba talent stems from the need for  consumer iq   as well as an operational mindset  and the ability to think strategically  analyze data and motivate team members </paragraph>
    <paragraph>relentless focus on the customer  every company we met with was aggressively focused on the customer  which reminds me of the first thing i learned in my core marketing class  if you don t know the answer  ask the customer  doubledutch co founder and ceo lawrence coburn discussed his difficult  yet keen decision early on to do one thing really well and focus on that  it would be impossible and expensive to serve multiple markets well  likewise  he advised that future founders document values early  this was refreshing to hear at a time when the tech industry has received bad pr regarding privacy  data collection and gender discrimination  the focus on values resonates with today s consumers who are more concerned than ever with corporate social responsibility  for example  hoteltonight doesn t collect any data it doesn t need  and nerdwallet ceo tim chen recalled sacrificing short term profits from google ads for long term growth and brand equity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>big company experience is good i thought startups would value other startup experience  but it turns out they value big company experience just as much  at stitchfix  a personalized styling platform for women  the executives previously worked at companies like gap  old navy  macy s and sephora  toutapp recently hired frank swain  the former vp of sales at appdynamics and splunk  as chief revenue officer to take the company to the next level  the rationale was that you get formal training at big companies  while at startups you get on the job training with the need for resourcefulness and a sense of urgency </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here is some other advice we received </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on company fit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on interviewing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on founding </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the alumni we met with reinforced the value of kellogg s experiential learning opportunities to build our resume while at business school  private equity lab provides hands on experience with private equity firms  while venture lab offers exposure to venture capital firms and their portfolio companies  in  nuvention  courses  students can explore entrepreneurial business concepts in areas such as social impact  medical innovations  energy  web  analytics and nanotechnology  kellogg even has designated co working space at      in downtown chicago where you can work alongside other founders </paragraph>

  <title> best bets for banking  business schools that help land jobs at prestige firms</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>admittedly  the percentage of mba students clamoring for jobs in investment banking is not what it once was  thanks       global financial crisis  nevertheless  the allure of exciting  highly compensated work that provides an opportunity to advance at break neck speed in terms of both responsibility and pay still makes many a job seeking mba student weak in the knees </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with annual starting salaries around          to say nothing of standard bonuses and other compensation investment banking draws a significant portion of graduating mbas at many top schools  and it s not just about the money  heading into investment banking also lets you work with c level executives right from the start  involves rubbing elbows with some of the most powerful people in business  provides a well defined career path for those who opt to stay in the industry and offers an array of jumping off opportunities  be it with client companies or starting your own firm </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we get it  there are a lot of great reasons to want to work in investment banking  so  if that s your prerogative  how do you choose a business school that will help you land the best possible job  good news  we ve dug into the data to help you figure it out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>latest school placement statistics there are many factors to take into consideration when you re trying to decide which business school will best position you to get the investment banking job you want  a good place to start can be looking at which schools send the greatest percentage of their students into the industry  while it can be argued that more students vying for spots in a given industry may mean greater competition  student appetite can also influence the resources schools allocate toward placing graduates in said industry  as well as the recruitment dollars spent by investment banking firms looking to snap those students up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>long gone are the days when investment banking rivaled consulting at most top schools as a prized destination for mba grads  columbia business school  cbs   which sent a whopping      percent into banking in       sent just      percent in       slightly outpacing cbs was the university of chicago booth school of business  where      percent followed the investment banking path  representing a slight uptick over the prior year s class       percent   but while certainly a more distant second to consulting  investment banking still remains the second most sought after career path at both schools  and many others  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of salaries  cbs      grads boasted a median starting salary of          with median other compensation totaling          at chicago booth  the median starting salary was also           and the median starting bonus was          here  too  investment banking holds its own against almost every other industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the front runner by far in terms of percentage of students heading into i banking was new york university s stern school of business  where the industry drew almost one in four      graduates     percent   that school s physical proximity to new york s famed financial district surely can t hurt  we should note  though  that this is down from    percent in      and    percent in       bucking the trend at cbs and booth  where interest in investment banking seems to be on an upward trajectory after a precipitous fall following the great recession  in terms of earning power  the mean base salary for      stern grads heading into investment banking was           together with a mean signing bonus of         and mean other guaranteed bonus of          this made for average overall compensation packages north of          </paragraph>

  <title>pepsico ceo endows yale som deanship with landmark gift</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>pepsico chairperson and ceo indra k  nooyi this week became the most generous lifetime benefactor in the history of her alma mater  the yale school of management  som   endowing the deanship of the school and kicking off the fifth decade innovation fund  the school announced yesterday </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my experience at the yale school of management forever altered the course of my life   the      yale som graduate said in a statement   my gift to this wonderful institution pales in comparison with the gift that yale gave me the fundamental understanding that leadership requires an expansive worldview and a deep appreciation of the many points of intersection between business and society   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ceo of pepsico since      and chairman since       nooyi has spearheaded  performance with purpose   the company s promise to integrate sustainability and social impact into its pursuit of exceptional financial performance  as part of this initiative  pepsico has diversified its product portfolio to meet changing consumer needs so that just    percent of its global revenue comes from carbonated soft drinks and    percent comes from the company s nutrition businesses  nooyi has also helped pepsico become a leader in sustainability  including reducing operational water use by    percent and improving operational energy efficiency by    percent since      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>edward snyder  who has led yale som since      and was reappointed to a second term as dean earlier this month  is the inaugural indra k  nooyi dean   having the deanship named in her honor communicates to the world the school s model of purposeful and broadminded leadership   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale som did not disclose the amount of nooyi s gift but shared that it will not only endow the deanship but also inaugurate the fifth decade innovation fund commemorating the school s entry into its fifth decade  the fund is designed  to advance the school s aim of developing leaders with the broad global mindset and multi disciplinary approach to business that is needed to succeed in   st century capitalism   according to the yale som website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it will fund the development of technology and other infrastructure to support innovative initiatives such as the school s focus on the connections between the private and public sectors  its integrated curriculum and its participation in the global network for advanced management  the fund will also help support the school s recently launched one year post mba degree  the master of advanced management  and increased emphasis on entrepreneurship through the program on entrepreneurship </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business issues are never just business issues  and my most ardent hope is that this endowment will teach future generations of leaders that the most successful companies of tomorrow will do more than make money   nooyi stated   they will make a difference and create shareholder value by improving the quality of life in every market in which they operate  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nooyi s most recent gift is the first by a woman to endow deanship at a top business school  yale som notes  though far from her first gift to the school  her prior contributions help fund construction of edward p  evans hall  which opened one year ago  and included gifts to name the nooyi classroom and the isaacson classroom in memory of professor larry isaacson </paragraph>

  <title>wharton professors examine what makes mbas happy</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>professors matthew bidwell and ethan mollick of the wharton school of business of the university of pennsylvania were recently acknowledged for their historic study on the happiness of entrepreneurs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the team discovered  after surveying        mba graduates over a span of years  that those who ended up running their own businesses ranked themselves happiest  a recent article by martin zwilling in forbes noted the professors  research  along with a list of tips for those entering the workplace as entrepreneurs </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>these pieces of advice include  do what you love and love what you do  stay in the present  possess realistic expectations  prioritize family time  keep track of successes  practice positive health habits  have an outlet for stress  trust your employees  pay attention to both sides of the brain  and have an optimistic approach </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bidwell and mollick found through their research that business owners who created startups that weren t initially successful even reported greater happiness with their decisions  their study  originally published in         contradicted the old saying that money cannot buy happiness  the more money someone earned  the happier they tended to be  the older respondents also tended to be happier than the younger ones  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mollick said   people tend to view entrepreneurship as an end state  that doesn t seem to explain what people actually do   noting that people tend  in the real world  to fluctuate between working for someone and running their own business  one of the most striking aspects of the team s study was the reality that in the modern economy  change is a fact of life </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even workers with high prestige credentials  including mbas from schools such as wharton  should expect to remain adaptable and should understand the necessity of reinvention in an unpredictable economy </paragraph>

  <title>anderson mbas win big in renewable energy competition</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this article has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a team of mba students from ucla s anderson school of management won first place last month in the renewable energy case competition  recc  at the university of michigan s ross school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>competitors included mba candidates from top schools in the united states and internationally </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>this year s case study centered around an issue that is facing the renewable energy industry that of the development of community solar projects  community solar provides retailers and consumers with the opportunity to purchase a portion of a solar  garden  which is shared among people who aren t able to install solar panels of their own due to the expense or to the nature of their property ownership </paragraph>
    <paragraph>teams in the recc were challenged to form a startup company that would fill this niche in the solar energy industry  they were asked to make two presentations to a group of venture capital investors in advance of the competition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perfectstorm  anderson s team  was comprised of three first year full time mba candidates  makibi takagi  dan komula and akhil modi  and two second year femba candidates  manoj rawat and alex wehrmann  the team s solution to the case study was to enlist retailers such as target and walmart in states that provide renewable energy credits to their residents  the proposal involved the retailers installing solar gardens on the rooftops of their stores and allowing customers to purchase portions of the energy from them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the anderson mbas noted the mutual benefit to customers and the retailers themselves  who would drive up loyalty through this unique program    installation of the solar gardens  would also demonstrate  the retailers s  corporate social responsibility to the customer and allow the customer to benefit from this   notes an article on anderson s blog </paragraph>

  <title>choose your own gmat adventure  gmac pilots new  select section order  option for exam</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>for many  feeling like you re in the driver s seat can make almost any experience better  but even the gmat  the graduate management admission council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmat exam  plans to find out as part of a new pilot program that will give a select group of test takers the ability to choose the order of the exam sections they complete </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit has obtained a copy of an email sent by gmac to recent test takers inviting them to participate in the  exclusive  invitation only opportunity   the testing period of the pilot is limited and expected to run from february   rd through march  th        according to the email  although exact test dates will vary depending on test center availability and other logistics  apart from participants getting to choose the order of the sections  the pilot exam experience will be identical to any other gmat exam  with standard test center policies and registration fees in place  as long as you accept your score at the conclusion of the pilot  it will be recorded as a legitimate score and included in all future score reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>small sample size for select section order pilot   participants in the pilot will get to choose from four options in terms of the order in which they tackle the respective quantitative  verbal  analytical writing and integrated reasoning sections of the test  optional breaks will be offered before and after each of the longer quant and verbal sections  the table below represents the four available options  with corresponding optional breaks </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>source  www mba com</paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to an faq page about the pilot on www mba com  invitations to participate were sent to a randomly selected subset of candidates who had registered on mba com with previously canceled gmat scores  the invited pool represents less than   percent of the total testing volume the minimum required to obtain meaningful results  according to gmac  given the small sample size  the pilot is not expected to impact the admissions pool for schools  since the chance that any individual school will receive a substantial number of pilot scores is  extremely unlikely   notes gmac </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the wider launch of the select section order feature will depend greatly on the results of the pilot   gmac wrote in its invitation to participants   gmac may decide not to launch the feature for any number of reasons  including candidate dissatisfaction   depending on participation levels  gmac may opt to send out additional invitations to take part at a later time  no schedule for further release of the select section order feature has been determined </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>how many times have you heard someone liken pursuing an mba to drinking from a fire hose  between the coursework  student clubs  networking  recruiting there aren t enough hours in the day  now imagine doing it as mom to a three year old </paragraph>
    <paragraph>katie colgary is a second year student doing precisely that juggling motherhood and the mba at harvard business school  hbs   she graciously agreed to share this recent blog post with clear admit s readers  in which she reveals how she does it  as well as what resources are in place at hbs to help make doing it possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph>colgary is clearly no stranger to challenges  before coming to hbs  she spent seven and a half years as a nuclear warfare officer in the u s  navy  she left the navy in later       welcomed son lincoln not long after and spent two years at home with him before joining the hbs class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we found her post incredibly inspiring  and also packed with great practical tips for other women contemplating juggling motherhood and the mba  we think you ll enjoy it  too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  the harvard business school mba voices admissions blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what do you enjoy most about being a mom </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my husband and i have one smart and adorable little boy  his name is lincoln  and he is a charmer  he just turned three earlier this month  my favorite thing about parenthood is sharing the experiences with my husband and watching lincoln develop into an inquisitive and engaging little kid  the dinner conversations we have now are quite entertaining </paragraph>
    <paragraph>were you nervous about juggling motherhood and the full time mba program  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>absolutely  the transition from full time mom to full time student was not easy  fortunately  my husband is the most supportive guy ever  and we have been able to share the parenting load  i would not be able to do this without his support and encouragement  we do not have any family in the area  and although we are used to moving around frequently and not being near family  it has been more challenging now that we have a child to care for </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the logistics aren t always easy  but most of the time they are worth it  some students have fomo   fear of missing out   and worry about missing out on the plethora of social activities during rc year  i have the other kind of fomo  i worry constantly about what milestones i might be missing and what my son is learning and doing during the day </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fortunately  i realize that my decision to pursue an mba at hbs is an investment in his future as well as my own and there s nothing as sweet as hearing him say   mommy goes to hahvahd  i want to go to hahvahd  in his mini boston accent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>have you connected with other women on campus who are getting their mba while being moms </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of my closest friends and classmates is another student mom  annette  she has two little ones and is a complete rock star  we met through one of the facebook groups before starting rc year  and have been friends ever since  annette and i have very different backgrounds  but since there are so few of us moms  we have gotten a chance to connect and learn from each other </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what kinds of resources are available for student moms on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the crimson parents  student club  is a great group of students and their partners  it is a wonderful resource should you choose to live on campus  particularly if you have a partner who will be at home during the week with your little one </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are not a lot of student moms  at last count  i believe there were seven in the class of        and many of us live off campus and have partners who work  or study   full time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is an informal groupme that was formed by one of our expectant moms  and we use it as a message board to coordinate occasional meetups and answer questions amongst the group </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are also two breastfeeding support rooms  pumping rooms  on campus  i was able to use them during the application process and during campus visits  as well as once school started  they are under lock and key but available for use by the entire community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what child care options are available on campus and in boston </paragraph>
    <paragraph>boston has some of the highest childcare costs in the country  wait lists for daycare can be over a year long  it is imperative that you look into daycare as soon as you are even considering coming to hbs  especially if considering the on campus daycare center  it s always in high demand although students do get a higher  priority  in the wait list  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are tons of private daycare options in the neighborhoods surrounding hbs  i live in davis square  and my son is in an excellent program there  the crimson parents club keeps a  babysitter reference  list  as well as some passed along info on local child care options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>do you live on or off campus  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i lived off campus in davis square prior to applying to hbs and still live there now </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you are moving to boston for hbs and you have a co parenting partner that does not work  i would highly suggest living on campus  the support for partners on campus is great </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you have a working partner  you might consider living off campus  where there are more convenient and accessible childcare options and easy access to the  t   the boston subway train system   although i did not participate in most of the weekday  late night  social scene  i was able to be involved in events that were important to me  despite living off campus  we loved coming to friendsgiving  holidazzle  section retreat and several other amazing events with the pandas of section a </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what s the best advice you received about coming to business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you are a mom and want to come get your mba at hbs  you should  but you really  really need to want it  when things get tough at home  as they always do with growing children   you need to be able to focus to get your work done  too  this means sleepless nights and stressed out mornings  many of your classmates just won t be able to relate  but that s okay   this is not about them  this is about you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what advice would you give to moms considering coming to hbs   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>apply and then start really planning  make sure you have your  parenting support system  figured out well in advance of day   whether it s a stay at home partner  daycare center  nanny or family member  while hbs might offer you admission into the mba program  they won t set up every aspect of your life for you  you need to be proactive and get your ducks in a row ahead of time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck  and reach out if you need help </paragraph>

  <title>employment stats reveal banner year for tuck class of      mbas</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as today s   p m  round   deadline approaches  are you furiously putting the finishing touches on your application to the tuck school of business  the school s most recent career statistics suggest that the effort you put into gaining admission to tuck should more than pay off when it comes time to look for a job </paragraph>
    <paragraph>late last month  the school shared details about where the tuck class of      graduates have landed and with a staggering    percent of them securing job offers within three months of graduation  it made for a record breaking year  add to that the fact that median base salaries jumped by eight percent  to           and the tuck career development office  cdo  can certainly feel good about the work it s doing </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s a good year   jonathan masland  cdo executive director  said modestly in an article on the tuck website   the secret to it is that everyone in our office gets to know each student so we can connect them with the right knowledge and people for their chosen career path   he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>drilling down into the career stats reveals that the overall distribution of students by business sector and industry remains much the same as it was last year  more than a third     percent  of tuck s      grads headed into consulting roles  down just slightly from last year s    percent  industry giants mckinsey   company  bain   company and the boston consulting group snapped up    students  or    percent of the overall class </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the financial services sector drew    percent of the class the second largest slice of the employment pie  these included jobs in investment banking  investment management  private equity and venture capital </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tech followed not far behind  with firms including microsoft  google and amazon hiring    percent of graduates  the growth in tech jobs coming out of tuck as well as many other mba programs has been significant in recent years  six or seven years ago  less than    percent of tuck graduates sought jobs in the technology sector  the school notes  masland credits the increases not merely to strength in tech hiring  but also to resources and opportunities the school offers to students interested in tech careers  one example is the silicon valley boot camp  an event organized by the cdo each year that lets incoming students explore tech related career opportunities while networking with employers and alumni in the industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>companies in the retail and consumer package goods  cpg  sectors wooed more tuck graduates than they have in the past     percent of the latest class  up from seven the year before  one such graduate  juan giovaneli  took a position at colgate palmolive  successfully using his time at tuck to transition from corporate communications to marketing  today he is an assistant brand manager at the huge cpg firm  completing a rotational program that will expose him to various different parts of the business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the efforts of the cdo  tuck graduates also credit the strength of the tuck alumni network for their successful career searches  another student  erica johnston  chose tuck for its strength in general management and marketing  hoping to transition from a job in manufacturing into a career she could be passionate about in the food industry   food allergies meant that all her life she d had to pay close attention to what she eats  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>guided by the cdo  she connected with a tuck alumna  lauren tankersley  mba     who helped arrange a summer internship for her in denver working for whitewave foods  the maker of silk soy milk  where tankersley is a marketing director  the power of the tuck alumni network didn t stop there  another alumna  sue allon  mba      who is a member of the tuck board of overseers and lives in denver extended an offer to johnston to live at her house for the summer and use her extra car   i was just blown away   johnston said in the article on the tuck website   to have a place to call home for the summer that was rent free  and a family to live with  it was just a wonderful experience  </paragraph>

  <title>average gmat  gpa scores for round   livewire entries  how do you measure up </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>while entries continue to trickle in  the volume on clear admit s livewire has slowed no real surprise given where we are in the mba admissions cycle  the vast majority of applicants in round   have received decisions from their target schools  round   applicants  meanwhile  are focused on wrapping things up with their applications as deadlines fill the days and weeks ahead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the relative lull has given us a chance to dig into the data submitted by applicants over the course of round    which we thought the clear admit audience might find interesting  for starters  we ve computed average reported gmat score and gpa for candidates who shared that they were admitted in round   at each of the    schools we track </paragraph>
    <paragraph> shocker  the ultra selective stanford graduate school of business topped the charts on both counts  with an average gmat score of     and an average gpa of        but the self reported stats were incredibly strong across the board  underscoring what a feat it is to gain admission to these leading mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as with all of our livewire analysis  we should note that our sample size is small and likely subject to some response bias  but we think it s pretty interesting nonetheless </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stay tuned for subsequent posts as we parse the round   data further  we ll let you know which school drew the most livewire responses overall  which school placed the greatest percentage of round   applicants on the waitlist and more </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  the hec paris mba experience with footnotes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>happy      everyone  today in fridays from the frontline  we re featuring a post submitted to us by prashant khorana about his hec paris mba experience  on twitter  khorana   prashantkhorana  describes himself as a data scientist mathematician who is passionate about analytics  economics  finance  leadership and investing and who hates unproductive activities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>titled  brief notes on the hec paris mba experience   the post is nonetheless longer than we generally publish here especially with the footnotes  which khorana doesn t want you to miss  so we ve offered you a taste to whet your appetite and encourage you to follow the link below to read the post in its entirety  he covers everything you ve ever wondered about hec paris  from getting in to settling in  from learning french to surviving st  cyr and triumphing at mbat  many thanks to khorana for sharing his experience with the clear admit audience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished from its original source  open strategist </paragraph>
    <paragraph>consider the mba  brief notes on the hec paris mba experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here s a didactic little parable you ve probably heard before  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there was once a powerful king who ruled many parts of the world  one day  shocked to discover that his wife had been unfaithful to him  he has her executed  in his bitterness and grief he decides that all women are the same  thus  he begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning  before they have a chance to dishonor him  eventually the servant  whose duty is to provide the women gets down on his knees and says    my king we ve run out of virgins   to which the king replies    well that s not true  i believe that you have two daughters  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the servant begs the king for his mercy and says    my king  please don t do this to me  have you forgotten all the years of service i ve done for you   but to no avail  the king forces the servant to offer him the daughters </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the servant s daughters was very brave  so in a very game of thrones   khaleesi type of fashion  she says    don t worry father  i can handle this   on the night of their marriage  she begins to tell the king a tale  but does not end it  the king  curious about how the story ends  is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion  the next night  as soon as she finishes the tale  she begins  and only begins  a new one  and the king  eager to hear the conclusion  postpones her execution once again  so it goes on for       nights    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now neither i m not here to tell you that i m very clever like the daughter  nor am i here to give you tips on how to escape death  i m here to remind you of this moralistic parable  because it communicates a very powerful message  that a story can save a life thousands of times  the mba program was my chance to tell stories with the same niftiness as the girl did  some day  if i find myself at a low point of life  and feel that all the things in my life are frustrating and my luck is absolutely the worst amongst everyone   i can look back and remember my      nights in the program  here are some notes i took along the way </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on admissions  it was april       and when i opened my inbox that morning  i could feel my forehead wrinkle with psychological pain  the top message in my color coded mailbox was another rejection from my first choice of b schools     the message was long  and like most generic responses  was designed to deceive me into believing that the person on the other side actually empathized about my personal defeats  after reading it  i asked myself the question    i ll have to do this all over again next year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like most b school applicants  i had spent an incalculable number of hours crafting essays  convincing recommendation providers  taking atrocious tests     so on and so forth  and in that moment  the last thing i desired to do was to reiterate the process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with the same thought in mind  i spent the next weekend searching for schools that still had an application round open   which finally led me to the hec application page  atypical to other schools  hec featured a candidate profile page   which quintessentially worked as a pre assessment tool     considering there wasn t much time left  i decided to proceed directly with the full application instead    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the essays were for the most part similar to other applications i had already completed  so i proceeded in the same fashion most mba applicants do   i copied a draft of my previous essays for other b schools  and rearranged them to fit the hec essay boxes  it took less than the weekend to do my research    and to push that button which displayed    submit      the action mostly left me with a false sense of satisfaction    and fatigue liberation that many desire everyday  and of course  in the back of my head  i could hear a voice spit out banal platitudes such as    if you never apply  you never know  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as i write this essay    sixteen months later  i ve come to realize that sometimes  banal platitudes can have a life changing impact on what you become  and that it was merely a banal platitude that brought me a step closer to obtaining the second most expensive piece of paper of my life     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on arrivals  i arrived at the front doors of campus like everyone else  with just two bags full of personal belongings from canada      i proceeded with the check in process     and subsequently moved my belongings to the on campus residence located on the august grounds  it took just under an hour to get to campus from the paris airport  following which i rushed to get a few things     from the closest store that was conveniently     located a few steps away from the front doors     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first two weeks were engaging and analogous to a game of tennis  the only difference was that first you watched the pros play the sport  players being the faculty   and then the pros watched you play and enjoy the same sports in a mildly sadistic fashion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the opening ceremonies  or in b school parlance  kickoff presentations were educational and led me to infer that faculty members have somewhat of sense of humor     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the induction period also established grounds for one of the many axiomatic principles of life as a b school student   that  your schedule controls you  you don t control it   which turns out to be one of the cliches with some truth to it      i showed up everyday  at nine on the dot  for a schedule of puzzling but impressive activities  the agenda varied from coaching on professional speaking  mbti personality type identification      negotiation games      introductory math workshops  improv comedy     sessions  and meetings with career advisors to things that simulated team building      tagged along with all this   i got a plethora of b school jargon thrown at me   the phrases were so oxygen depriving that they only reminded me of the greetings that flight staff members usually give before a plan takes off     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the phrases included catchphrases such as   end to end gtm strategy frameworks  paradigm changes  global strategic transversal initiatives  cross platform synergies  or unicorns as i prefer to call them   batch mates     etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the end of the two weeks  i found myself tried on levels of extroversion and basic math  subsequent to which i got permission to take on the actual coursework      which mostly reminded of the statement bain made to batman    ahh yes  now you have permission to die  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the upside of having a defined schedule is that you don t have to do a lot of thinking  or prep for that matter  which leaves room for socializing and exploration of the inner self  some fellow blues     decided to set up a tradition of dressing up well on tuesdays   sort of an anti casual friday movement     </paragraph>

  <title>said business school alum s venture transforms how companies meet</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an mba alumnus from oxford university s said business school recently launched an innovative company that provides unique meeting spaces for businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>julian jost founded spacebase in early       which he describes as  the first global peer to peer marketplace for workshop and meeting spaces   the company is based in berlin and provides meeting locations in europe  as well as in cities such as tel aviv  cape town and hong kong </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>jost and his partner and friend jan hoffman keining are former strategic consultants  they observed a trend in the business world of companies investing valuable time and money conducting conventional meetings on their own premises or in conference spaces in hotels  they discovered that the average employee spends    hours a month in meetings  and in the united states  this added up to      billion in expenditures for companies </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we offer a new approach to traditional business meetings   jost said during a recent interview    spacebase enables companies to hold their meetings in unique spaces  such as an old theatre in amsterdam  an indoor farm in berlin or even a boxing ring in munich  which allows them to reinvigorate their staff and find new and unexpected solutions and ideas  plus our venues often offer a cheaper alternative to traditional spaces  such as hotel conference rooms  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jost and hoffman keining developed their business model based upon elements of the sharing economy   the idea that a venture can create collaboration between different stakeholders and offer a service that meets all of the competing demands of the stakeholders through simple but effective processes made complete sense to me   said jost </paragraph>

  <title>the consortium  promoting minorities in american business and business schools for    years</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fewer than   percent of the        mba students who graduate from top tier business schools are african american  native american or hispanic american  and according to a recent bloombergbusiness article   corporate recruiters consistently bemoan the lack of qualified candidates of color  and they re willing to pay a premium to nonwhite  and non asian  new hires   in fact  among american mba candidates  african americans and hispanics who accepted jobs by april      earned around        more per year than white and asian grads  bloombergbusiness reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the consortium for graduate study in management is working to increase the numbers of qualified minority businessmen and women  one individual at a time  the consortium believes the best way to increase representation of minority groups in american business and education is to provide additional opportunities for minorities to achieve an mba education </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the consortium was created in      as a non profit organization dedicated to helping african american men gain the business skills they needed to secure positions in american corporations  it started by connecting just    african american men with    corporate partners  by       the consortium quickly grew to include women  hispanic americans and native americans  from there it has continued to grow and help more and more individuals  to date  more than       of the country s best mba students have achieved their goals thanks in part to scholarships  new opportunities and the diverse network the consortium provides </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the consortium s goals is to save minority mba candidates time and money  when you become a consortium fellow  you ll have access to a community of representatives from    plus corporate partners     mba programs and more than       consortium alumni  as a fellow  you ll also have access to merit based  full tuition fellowships to some of the country s top mba programs  of those admitted to the consortium  approximately    percent are offered a scholarship  last year      fellowships covering full tuition and mandatory fees were awarded </paragraph>
    <paragraph>becoming a consortium fellow is simple  just as you apply for an mba program  you can apply to the consortium  selection is based on academic records and evidence of commitment to the consortium s mission of promoting the inclusion of african americans  hispanic americans and native americans in business  your community activism  professional involvement and life experience will be reviewed within an application essay and letter of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the key to becoming a fellow at the consortium is your commitment to change the perceptions of historically underrepresented groups  involvement with one or more of the following organizations helps to demonstrate this commitment and can strengthen your candidacy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are several advantages to consortium membership  for example  members can apply to up to six top u s  mba programs by completing a single application  that s right  instead of completing different applications for each individual school  as a consortium member you can complete a single application and apply to all six  you also pay a discounted fee to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition  consortium members have access to a variety of webinars and chats to help prospective mba candidates make the right decisions about their education  career and future  these events offer information on member schools and how to build a strong application  as well as more information on the consortium itself  the consortium admissions process opens annually on august   th  the first round deadline is october   th  and the second round deadline is january  th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each year  the consortium holds an annual orientation program   career forum  the forum gathers       mba prospects  university representatives  corporate partner representatives and alumni for an intensive five day conference of preparatory events  networking opportunities  job interviews and socializing  the forum the highlight of the year for students  alumni  schools and corporate partners offers a series of seminars and workshops delivering useful  real world career development advice directly to students from the best education institutions and corporations in the country </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not sure if the consortium is right for you  prospective mba applicants can check out the consortium blog to learn more about the program  full of detailed information about anything and everything that matters to the consortium  the blog is available to members and non members alike </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for mba students  alumni and corporations  the consortium offers an opportunity to increase diversity in mba programs and the workplace  according to a recent article in bloombergbusiness  consortium ceo peter aranda said that elite business schools are kidding themselves if they think they are doing all they can to promote diversity   they believe that the efforts that they are doing right now are giving them all of the candidates  who  exist   he told bloomberg   everyone s kind of stuck in the same place   the role of the consortium is to help people get unstuck </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there s still time to apply by the january          deadline </paragraph>

  <title>lbs alum explores the next frontier as part of international space mission</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a      graduate from london business school s emba program blasted off on december           as part of the international space mission </paragraph>
    <paragraph>colonel tim kopra is a nasa astronaut whose path to business school was somewhat rocky  in       he was training for an upcoming space mission when a biking accident thwarted his plans </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>with less than six weeks before his second trip to the international space station  he experienced a devastating fall during his usual sunday morning bike ride  nasa bans astronauts from high risk activities during their training  such as skiing  sky diving or motorcycle riding  but not bicycle riding  the fall broke kopra s hip  preventing him from continuing his training and from completing the mission </paragraph>
    <paragraph> frankly  because of the bicycle accident  i was afforded an opportunity to do something different   kopra said in a recent interview   i d been interested in going to business school for a very long time  i have a great job  and i d like to keep it for the time period i m scheduled to fly  but the school s global emba program really appealed to me  i thought it would give me a chance to identify what other opportunities are out there for astronauts if i chose to do something different  and also to learn a skill set that could be used both within and outside nasa  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>describing lessons learned during his emba that aided his success as an astronaut  he said   when you undertake case studies  what you re learning about is human behavior  decision making  leadership techniques  organizational structure and how to be more effective and more efficient  those are lessons that someone can carry to any job  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kopra and his fellow space explorers took off on december   th from kazakhstan  they will return to earth in june       video of the blast off is available here </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  forte mbalauncher shares her round   application experience</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>natalie neilson learned about the forte foundation s mbalaunch program a    week  hands on workshop for promising female applicants to business school in a somewhat backwards fashion  it all began with an interest in looking into business schools abroad  with the mba program at oxford university s said business school sparking her curiosity  after researching  she realized that oxford did not come to many events in dc  but she saw that the school would be participating in an upcoming forte forum  and so she went  at the forum  she saw people wearing name tags with a special ribbon that said  mbalauncher   so she asked to learn more  before long she would be wearing an mbalauncher ribbon herself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>neilson is something of a non traditional applicant to business school in part because she s looking to use the degree to transition out of consulting  the opposite of many would be mbas  the daughter of jamaican immigrants and someone who has also spent years working in restaurants  her dream is to eventually put her mba and prior consulting experience to work  specifically helping ethnic restaurants enhance their business operations by owning her own hospitality consultancy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we caught up with her recently  just after she submitted the last of her applications as part of round    in the interview that follows  you ll learn more about her application process  including what she found most enjoyable and what proved most challenging  you ll also get her uncensored views on the mbalaunch program  insight into other mba admissions preparation programs  she is also active in management leadership for tomorrow   and her take on the value of business school rankings  our thanks to neilson for taking time out of a busy schedule to share her story </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what industry are you targeting post mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>natalie neilson  my desire is to go into hospitality  and it s very non traditional compared to some of the more popular post mba routes like investment banking and consulting  so  with that in mind  i applied across the board for programs that had characteristics important to me  like academic rigor and cultural fit  i knew that from a professional standpoint  it was going to be largely up to me to network within the industry and get a job  no matter where i went to school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i am interested in the hospitality industry because i have been working in restaurants since i was a teenager  i went to college in dc and am now working in government consulting  before deciding to go get your mba  a lot of reflection should go into it  i decided to think about whether i wanted to come back to my company  or do something different  or even if there is something in between  there are always going to be aspects of every job that you ll like  and some that you don t  so i decided to see if there was an option out there that combined what i loved about consulting with the industry that i love  for example  i like working on a team and having that client consultant relationship  tackling issues  working on complex problems and turning them into solutions  variability of clients is a reason some people are drawn to consulting  but at this point in my career  i would like to be in a place where i can see the end result in house i am looking to make an impact where i am </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with that in mind  short term i want to pivot from consulting and work in internal strategy at a hospitality corporation  from my research with current students at different programs  marriott  starwood and hilton are great mba recruiting options in terms of getting that corporate hospitality experience  long term  i want to combine my restaurant experience  consulting skills and corporate hospitality work into launching my own consultancy specifically for restaurant owners of color </paragraph>
    <paragraph>restaurant success rates are pretty bad across the board  but if you have lived in any major city lately  you ll notice that ethnic restaurants tend to close first when anything changes  i m a believer in neighborhood culture  unfortunately  though  the restaurant consulting business isn t very diverse  i ve worked in all kinds of restaurants  and i want to help move the needle  ensuring that restaurants of all types are equipped to stay open and serve their communities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what schools did you apply to and what factored into your decision of where to apply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nn  since some decisions have yet to be released  i don t want to answer that question fully  i can say that i applied to all top programs remembering i m going for a non traditional mba industry  thus  my initial decision was to cast a wide net while researching  i talked to current students everywhere  learning all i could and asking a lot of questions to anyone who would be willing to offer their perspective  in my opinion  current students are the best source of knowledge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of choosing between schools to apply to i knew that it was going to be an uphill battle to obtain a job no matter what  given my target industry  i spoke to the hospitality club president at a few top schools  only to learn that two of them interned at the same company in the same department  they were literally co interns  in the field i am pursuing  no one is going to be like   you can t have this internship because you went to x top school vs y top school  just like working at a restaurant  it s about who you are  your work ethic and attitude and what you bring to the table   i didn t realize that was a pun until this moment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i did not choose schools because of rankings in fact  i am really anti ranking  i don t care which school is number one because the schools that were numbers one  two  three when i first started my research a couple years ago have changed a little bit  some people are gung ho about going to the    school  but it doesn t make sense to me to make a decision based on a number that can change  it s not lasting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>instead  i chose to think of something more solid  in my opinion  brand  now before you roll your eyes  credibility is big when you want to work with customers of all socioeconomic and educational levels  some people who own restaurants never went to college or even finished high school  sometimes we forget  in our pre mba bubbles  that people you bump into on the street don t know ranking  but they know brand  when i approach someone who didn t go to college to hire me in their restaurant  i want them to think i am credible when they hear where i got an mba  they are not going to be like   ok wait  let me check us news  you went to    and i only hire top     my dreams are very global and i want to know that no matter where i go or who i speak to  that person can understand my credentials </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what did you enjoy most about the application process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nn  it sounds weird  but i have enjoyed interviewing the most  as nerve wracking as it can be  i think i do better in person than i do on paper whether it s interviewing  talking to an admissions officer at the forte forums or speaking to current students on the phone  it s not just in terms of me being able to show my value but also in terms of learning what the value of the school is  sometimes the websites don t tell the whole story about the school  just as sometimes your application doesn t tell the whole story about you  no matter how much you try   plus  it s a great opportunity to gush about what you want to do sometimes people can pick that up in your eyes easier than they can in     words </paragraph>

  <title>choosing the best business school for consulting</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with round   decisions released for dozens of leading business schools  some applicants find themselves in the enviable position of having secured multiple acceptances  as successful applicant preston landers put it in our fridays from the frontline post last week   it s my turn to do the rejecting  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  with the hard work of applying behind them  round   applicants now face the equally important task of deciding which business school will best meet their needs  others are still gunning for round   deadlines no doubt trying to craft essays that reflect deep knowledge of individual school programs and how they dovetail with their personal career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to help in either endeavor  clear admit is launching a new series designed to drill down into the career placement statistics and other resources at individual schools on an industry by industry basis  we re kicking things off with a look first at some of the best business schools for consulting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>consulting continues to be a top draw for mbas unlike investment banking  which lost some of its allure for mba grads in the wake of the financial crisis  consulting has held its own as one of the most sought after industries to work in after business school  the      prospective student survey conducted by the graduate management admissions council  gmac  reveals that consulting topped the list of intended industries for both millennial and gen x respondents  with    and    percent respectively seeking jobs in either consulting services or management consulting upon graduation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>part of the allure of consulting is the diverse work  consultants get to think creatively and solve problems  analyze both the big picture and the details and work on teams juggling multiple assignments  top salaries don t hurt either  recent mba graduates taking jobs at firms like boston consulting group  bcg   bain   company  mckinsey   company and other consulting powerhouses reported starting base salaries of between          to           with additional signing bonuses of          according to managementconsulted com  an online resource for the consulting industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>choosing the best business school for consulting determining which leading business school will best prepare you for a career in consulting requires looking at a range of factors  including career outcomes at individual schools  both in terms of summer internships and full time jobs  if possible with the available data  you also want to get a sense of how well a school has done placing career switchers  namely those without prior consulting experience  in coveted consulting roles  since presumably barriers for entry are higher here than for counterparts who have already worked in the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it can also be instructive to see which of the powerhouse consulting firms donate to which leading business schools  finally  it helps to understand how a given school goes about teaching its students to be consultants  what role experiential learning places  whether you can hope to learn directly from superstar professors in the field and what extracurricular resources are in place to help you land your dream consulting gig </paragraph>

  <title>an in depth look at the forte foundation for women mbas</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to catalyst org  women make up only      percent of mbas earned in the united states  even worse  a landmark study by the university of michigan business school revealed that women make up less than    percent of corporate board members in america s     largest companies  the forte foundation is working to change those numbers  it s a non profit consortium dedicated to launching women into fulfilling  significant careers through access to business education  opportunities and a community of successful women leaders </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business is a great career destination for women  and in everything that we do  we are trying to highlight all of the amazing opportunities and options that women have in pursuing a business career and a business education getting their mba   says elissa sangster  executive director of forte   there s no end to the different options women have in a business career because there are so many different directions they can go from being an entrepreneur to being in banking  marketing or even non profit work  it is a great place to be  and it s also a very rewarding place to be  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a quick look at the forte foundation website demonstrates the organization s commitment to advancing businesswomen  forte has provided     million in fellowships to       mba women  thanks to its partnerships with more than    different mba programs  beyond fellowships  forte offers a wealth of information for members and for women mba candidates who are interested in learning more about getting into an mba program and making the most of their career </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are a variety of unique opportunities for women   the first general resource is to access the webinars available on getting an mba   says sangster   those answer the general questions about why to get an mba  what s important for your career path and where to look for help post mba  there are panels  presentations and interviews with experts  for mba candidates  there s plenty to read and plenty to watch to help give you a broad overview of an mba  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>however  the webinars are just a place to start   the forte forums series is an excellent opportunity to look at specific mba programs and how to get admitted   continues sangster   you ll hear from schools and from women who achieved their mba to discover why it was valuable for them and what they re doing now   she also recommends taking a look at the blogs and mba student profiles  women  members or not  can discover pertinent mba information  meet forte members and learn how to advance their career and mba application throughout the website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for more detailed help  forte offers the mbalaunch program discussed in detail on clearadmit   the mbalaunch program is a curriculum that helps women really fine tune their application  it helps them understand the true fit of a school so they can make a wise decision and prepares them for submitting their application   sangster shares   it goes through the interview process  taking the gmat and discusses all the things an mba candidate needs to think about  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>forte also  provides valuable resources for women looking for financial help for their mba  the forte fellows program was created to help spur female mba enrollment by offering fellowships for full time  part time and executive mba programs   the requirements to gain a forte fellowship vary between schools   says sangster   if you want to know if you have a chance  look at the class profile of the program you want  if your criteria are above average  then you re on the right track  they pick the top women in their applicant pool  the most important thing to do is to understand where you fit in that program s profile  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re looking for information about women who get their mba  what they look like and whether you could be one of them  sangster recommends reading some of the profiles on the forte website and understanding more about the forte fellows   our website contains fellow profiles that reveal where they were working before  where they went to school  what kind of extra curricular experiences they might have had and what they did in their spare time  it s a great way to understand more about what these women are doing  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the end of the day  it s the accomplishments of the forte foundation that speak to its benefits for members   this year  for the first time  we saw      percent of women enrolled in our forte schools it was    percent when i first started working at forte   says sangster   embedded within that number is the fact that    of our schools have enrolled more than    percent women  and    of those schools are above    percent in women s enrollment  our schools are very committed to heading toward    percent women enrollment  and the schools that are already at    percent have not taken their eye off the    percent mark  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>membership in the forte foundation is free   any woman is welcome to join the forte foundation   says sangster   so much of our content applies to any woman  no matter what career path she is in  there are a lot of leadership webinars  articles and messages of empowerment that they can access through forte  there is always something to learn  even if you re not interested in business  for businesswomen  the content and opportunities are very relevant  you can connect with companies  find job postings and attend programs just for the forte network  </paragraph>

  <title>who got in  who got waitlisted  who got dinged  livewire results for hbs and chicago booth</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit s mba livewire has been on fire these past two weeks with round   applicants sharing their triumph and defeat in the mba admissions process at top schools  with    schools releasing decisions this week wharton  darden  mit sloan  ross and tuck among them we expect record activity to continue  and we ll be keeping tabs on the decisions as they roll in  in the meantime  we re digging into some of the data shared last week  specifically with regard to how applicants fared at harvard business school  hbs  and the university of chicago booth school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first up  let s take a look at hbs  which released round   decisions on december  th  just as promised </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>reported gpas for those who were admitted to the class of      at hbs ranged from     to      with an average of       the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      for those waitlisted  the ranges and averages were much the same   the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of       those who didn t make the cut  meanwhile  had gpas between      and      average        and gmat scores between     and      average        those rejected from hbs were at least in good company representing    percent of livewire reports  acceptances accounted for    percent  and waitlisted applicants comprised the remaining    percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as was the case when interview invitations were extended for hbs  the main conclusion to be drawn is that you can t expect to get into hbs without really great stats  but great stats alone don t guarantee admission </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  we should note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who were accepted to hbs may be more likely to share the news publicly  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>greater percentage of acceptances at chicago booth a look at data for chicago booth  where decisions were also released on december  th  reveals similar patterns  here  reported gpas for applicants who were accepted ranged from      to      with an average of       gmat scores  meanwhile  fell between     and      with an average score of      for those who were placed on the waitlist  gpas ranged from      to       averaging       and gmat scores ranged from     to      with an average of      those who got a ding  meanwhile  had gpas between      and     and gmat scores between     and      with averages exactly the same as those accepted  gpa        gmat score       </paragraph>
    <paragraph> with chicago booth data  as with the data regarding hbs applicants  the sample size was small and selection bias may also be at play  not entirely surprisingly  livewire reports were far more positive for chicago booth applicants than for those who applied to hbs  those reporting acceptances at chicago booth represented    percent of total livewire submissions  compared to    percent waitlisted and    percent rejected </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thanks for sharing your results via clear admit s livewire  with hundreds more submissions coming in from applicants to schools releasing decisions this week  we re already at work parsing that data  so stay tuned </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  a successful round   applicant shares his tips on managing the process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week we are delighted to feature the following post from preston landers  a senior consultant for deloitte digital who has just completed the application process for business school  as you ll read  he applied to seven leading mba programs  got interviews at six and has now been admitted at three  he humbly calls himself an amateur  but we think the advice he offers is spot on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our thanks to landers  whose frequent posts on reddit s mba thread spurred us to ask him to contribute something here on clear admit  and a hearty congratulations for a job well done  we can t wait to see where he ends up in the fall </paragraph>
    <paragraph>go big or go home phew  time to exhale  i got into an mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i didn t make it easy for myself  i applied to seven schools in round    since i m from an overrepresented industry  tech consulting   i figured the more chances  the better  but that approach required that i execute all seven applications with the same attention to detail i d exert for just one app </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in this post  written on an airplane    i ll share six tips for applicants who are considering whether to  go big or go home  with five or more apps in a single round  i m no expert and i might have achieved success in spite of these efforts but i m satisfied with my results  all told  i interviewed at six of the seven schools  hbs  stanford gsb  wharton  kellogg  haas and tuck  and was ultimately admitted to wharton  tuck and kellogg s dual degree mmm program  which awards graduates with both an mba from kellogg and an ms in design innovation from the segal design institute at the mccormick school of engineering and applied science   here s my amateur advice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i m very fortunate to have multiple offers  and i ll spend the next month contemplating my decision  i ve really fallen in love with all three schools  but after receiving four rejections  it s my turn to do the rejecting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lastly  it s empowering to remember that the mba is a means and not an end  after all we ve accomplished  my fellow admits and i are ready to take on even bigger challenges  i m eager to get started  but maybe after a vacation or two  </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>the entire class of      divided up into    teams to tackle thorny issues confronting social media giant twitter as part of the  th annual integrative case competition at the samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management  four finalist teams battled it out for cash prizes and bragging rights on december  rd to close out the first semester of their first mba semester </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is the role of great institutions of higher learning to help great corporate institutions solve great problems   drew pascarella  faculty lead for the competition  said in a statement   you are challenged to assess  value and propose a tangible and actionable solution for one of the world s most talked about companies  twitter  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  students were tasked with examining twitter s lack of profitability  declining user engagement  soaring competition and ambiguous product focus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since its launch in       first years at johnson have competed as part this unique case competition as their first semester final project  the integrative case competition  which is sponsored by liberty mutual and corning  calls on them to combine the functional knowledge  decision making ability and leadership and presentation skills they ve honed since arriving at business school </paragraph>

  <title>how to know if an mba is right for you</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>at the most basic level  the question most mba candidates inevitably begin with is   why should i pursue an mba   a seemingly simple question  it is possibly the most significant one to consider on the path to a graduate degree  but much of the answer depends on weighing your individual pros versus cons and addressing common myths about an mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the first misconceptions on the road to an mba is about qualifications  many are convinced that only those with business related undergraduate degrees can get into a good school  others feel that their test scores  work experience or prior coursework would limit their appeal to admissions departments  in truth  any prospective student can be qualified with the right commitment and preparation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there is no such thing as an  ideal  mba candidate   says full time mba student jerrod dolenz   students represent a variety of professional backgrounds  personalities  countries and career ambitions  learning in that environment is part of the value of the degree  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dolenz is on track to graduate in      from georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  prior to business school  his professional experience spanned working as a paralegal and serving in the peace corps in africa  armed with an english degree  dolenz considered other graduate programs like law  international affairs and public administration  ultimately  he decided to pursue an mba because he found it more solution oriented than other degrees  arming him with versatile skills for the future </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the greatest benefit of an mba is the ability to hit the reset button on your career  it created an incredible number of opportunities   he explains   and i was drawn to mcdonough for its emphasis on collaborative problem solving  inclusive culture and a rigorous core curriculum  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>banking and consulting aren t the only paths similarly  full time mba candidate coral taylor successfully debunked a few myths on her way to enrolling at mcdonough  while many align business school with a career on wall street or in consulting  taylor intends to use her mba to make positive social change in the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i decided to get my mba because i share a fundamental belief that corporate america can and should be the greatest catalyst for change in society   says taylor   before my mba  i knew non profits could make a huge impact  but their challenges could impede their ability to serve  i wanted to learn how the public and private sectors can create and sustain models of social change  i also wanted to make a switch into the corporate sector and chose an mba to accomplish both of those goals  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>taylor spent her summer interning at starbucks  where she  learned that they didn t just throw money at social change it s embedded in their corporate strategy   she will begin her post mba career in the company s seattle headquarters as part of the category brand management team  other students are using their mbas to pursue careers in non profits  non governmental organizations  the federal or state government and international development </paragraph>
    <paragraph>versatility is a top selling point for an mba  thanks in part to a more diverse and well rounded student body  admissions committees like mcdonough s often take a holistic approach to reviewing applications  with an eye toward creating a widely varied class  this has two benefits  first  it allows applicants to prove themselves according to their academic ability  personal achievements and professional experiences  second  it results in an array of both full time and part time students from different backgrounds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on that note  dolenz admits he has  become much more effective working with diverse teams and more self aware of qualities that lead to effective leadership  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an mba s advantages extend beyond the classroom in addition to the coursework  business school also introduces networking and co curricular and other academic and professional opportunities that deliver a direct return on investment  in fact  for dolenz the mcdonough mba career center was key to his future position with deloitte s human capital practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the mba career center was instrumental in connecting me to and preparing me for my offer   he says   the center works closely with deloitte in hosting recruiting events  and i ve used its career coaches for advice  resume reviews and interview practice  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what s more  an mba delivers not just academic and professional knowledge  but the chance to improve on a personal level too  the transformation one goes through to obtain the degree helps to build confidence  executive presence and maturity in a way that few other experiences can offer </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you always should be out of your comfort zone   says taylor   being able to rise to a challenge or face something or someone intimidating is what makes us learn and become stronger  business school does that  it s the place to try and fail and to get better every time  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jerrod dolenz ft    hometown  iola  ks pre mba career  ifc  levy konigsberg llp  peace corps internship  international executive service corps student involvement  select   student government association vice president of community  mba volunteers president  net impact member  gala member  graduate student consulting group member why an mba   i researched many degree programs  law  mpa  international affairs  before choosing an mba and ultimately decided that i wanted a degree that would position me to solve problems for clients in the private and the public sectors  i have used my time in business school to strengthen my quantitative skills and hone my analytical approach to problem solving through strategy courses  i have also developed my leadership skills as a vice president of the student government association and in club leadership roles  </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>it s getting to be that time of the year  for the sake of being somewhat politically correct  it s the slightly chillier time of the year that s directly proportional to increased gift giving  if you work most   to   jobs  there s likely some type of end of calendar year celebration planned which can be make or break time in office social circles  you want to sit next to brad from marketing who is super dreamy and knows more about the walking dead and shark tank than the producers while avoiding mark from finance who can be heard a mile away because he jingles orange tic tacs in his shirt pocket  wait  is it marketing who is dreamy or is it brad  since when did finance grow legs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before you go running to the party planning committee  let s take a look at misplaced modifiers and how they can derail not only your holiday party  but your sentence correction experience on the gmat  modifiers diversify sentence structure and allow the writer to do more within a simple sentence  however  modifier errors create problems in meaning and are commonly tested on the gmat </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most common modifiers on the gmat are prepositional phrases  participial phrases  appositive phrases and relative clauses  prepositional phrases start with   you guessed it   a preposition such as from or on  common errors involved location in a sentence so instead of </paragraph>

  <title>u s  news short list takes a closer look at how many applications top business schools receive</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as round   applicants anxiously await word from their top choice mba programs  does it help or hurt to know just how many applications those programs receive each year  u s  news  best known in the mba space for its annual ranking of top business schools  this week devoted its separate short list in which it parses data collected as part of the rankings process to spotlight individual data points to overall application volume at leading schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perhaps not surprisingly  the schools that draw the greatest number of applicants also occupy most of the top spots in the u s  news rankings  specifically  in      the three schools that received the most applications were also ranked as the top three business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  received more applications than any other for the mba class that started in fall            and placed second in the overall rankings  stanford graduate school of business fell below hbs in terms of number of applicants       but placed first in the rankings   with an entering class half the size of hbs s  stanford is the most selective of all mba programs   third  both in the rankings and in terms of the number of applicants  was the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  with       applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>farther down the list  things got a little more interesting  for example  the fourth most popular business school in terms of application volume was columbia business school  receiving       applicants in       despite its  th place ranking overall   maybe its new york city location has a little something to do with the high number of applicants  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ucla s anderson school  ranked   th overall  was  th in terms of application volume  drawing       applicants in       that number was just shy of the  th ranked university of chicago booth of business  which drew       mba hopefuls last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the average number of applications received per school at the    schools with the most applicants in      was        so however you may fare as admissions decisions are doled out  you can take solace in knowing that you are in good company </paragraph>

  <title>online meets offline for today s consumer  notes wharton professor</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>david bell  professor of marketing at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania  recently presented research exploring the intersection between online and offline shopping during a talk at the university of delaware s alfred lerner college of business and economics </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bell is a specialist in consumer behavior  specifically how this behavior plays out online </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph> now people have a more sophisticated and nuanced view that says  online and offline are good for different things   said bell  addressing the complexities inherent in the modern consumer s shopping experience   maybe they re not substitutes   he continued   maybe they re complimentary in interesting ways   he described the recent trend in retail sales of showrooms  which give customers the opportunity to try items in person before placing an online delivery order  this allows buyers the tactile experience of the goods before purchasing them  in addition to giving brick and mortar businesses the advantage of foot traffic </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bell s research team presented the example of warby parker  the popular eyeglass company founded by wharton mbas that used the innovative approach of allowing online customers to try on items before deciding to purchase them  as a result of adding a showroom  the company observed a   percent increase in demand  overall sales grew due to increased brand awareness  though sales through the try on delivery method decreased  warby parker s overall efficiency increased due to the fact that the company sent   percent fewer pairs of sample glasses to customers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>describing a phenomenon coined  the neighborhood effect   bell pointed out the importance of customer referrals in the online offline model </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if you can get your existing customers to bring in more customers  that s going to be a really powerful lever of growth  by now having this additional channel  you ve made one of your other channels more efficient   bell noted </paragraph>

  <title>help a fellow applicant out via the clear admit interview archive</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba applicants are sometimes perceived as cutthroat competitors  willing to do anything to gain an advantage over their peers  at clear admit  we know that is simply not true  as part of our past work as consultants advising applicants directly and in our current role as a digital media company covering the mba space we have met many extraordinary prospective mba students who are more than willing to help a fellow applicant out  we think this bodes well for the mba classrooms they ll end up in where collaboration and teamwork are highly valued as well as for the future of business itself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today  we are inviting the current crop of prospective mba students to help a fellow applicant out by contributing to the clear admit interview archive  in case you are unfamiliar with our interview archive  it is a unique repository of more than       reports submitted by mba applicants after they have interviewed with one or more of their target top tier business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>easy to sort by school  the clear admit interview archive was developed with applicants  needs in mind  and the details shared in these reports from the types of questions to expect to what the applicant would do differently if he or she had it to do over provide invaluable information to other applicants anxiously preparing for their own interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  have you benefited from the clear admit interview archive  we know many of you are nodding  in fact  we ve actually had numerous applicants tell us that they credit their own acceptance to their top school in part to the insight they gained from the interview reports found there </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you ve been using the interview archive to prepare for your interviews  won t you please take a moment and repay the favor  because as you might imagine  the interview archive is only as good as the reports applicants submit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re not sure what to write  we ll make it easy for you  we ve learned that the most helpful and informative reports usually include the following information </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  you are welcome to share as much or as little as you like whatever information you may have found helpful yourself  the point is  please share  you owe it to your fellow applicants plus it will help you prepare for those collaborative mba classrooms you re hoping to enter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what are you waiting for  submit your interview report now </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  mit sloan student scrutinizes her mba balance sheet</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>is the high cost of an mba worth it  this question gets bandied around frequently  most often by skeptics on the sidelines who have never set foot in a business school classroom  this week in fridays from the frontline we are pleased to share a recent post from a current mit sloan mba student who gives us her take on whether the significant funds she s invested into her two years at sloan was money well spent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>erica zendell is a sloan mba who will graduate this spring and a self proclaimed  bargain hunter   she wants to feel like she s gotten value for her investment be it when she buys a piece of clothing or commits six figures and two years to business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the post that follows she admits that she s not immune to occasional buyer s remorse with regard to the mba  but on the whole  she s convinced that between the expanded opportunities open to her now that weren t at the beginning of her time at sloan and the manifold hard to measure intangibles  which  account for everything that s worth it about being in business school  she has faith that she s coming out on top </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our thanks to zendell for sharing her thoughts with the clear admit audience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from the mit sloan student blog  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the business school  balance sheet </paragraph>
    <paragraph>speaking as a mba with plans to enter the retail industry after graduation  i couldn t help but spend my thanksgiving break thinking deeply about shopping  i m a notorious bargain hunter and well before business school was constantly fascinated by why and how people buy what they buy  and by the manifold tactics retailers and brands use to turn closed minds into open wallets  if you ve done your job well as a consumer  be it on black friday or any given shopping day  you leave the store with some degree of confidence in what you ve bought  what it ll do for you  and the price you paid for it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i d argue shopping for business schools is much the same as any shopping experience  you reflect on the things you want from your mba experience and your post mba life and you seek the places you believe will give them to you  you learn as much as you can where you can by perusing websites  visiting campuses  sitting in on classes  looking at job placements  and talking to students and alumni  eventually you decide on the schools for which you ll risk the money  time  and energy to go from  prospective candidate  to  admitted student   once you ve gotten in  you undergo another round of research before deciding on the school that will have the privilege of transforming you from  admitted student  to   st year mba  and your bank account from  healthy  to  hemorrhaging  on account of the typical and atypical expenses of student life  tuition  paid  of course  impromptu trip to turkey  not taken  mba trip to the british virgin islands  to be determined </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sometimes  i experience buyer s remorse about doing my mba  i think   when you re paying for medical school  you re ultimately paying to become a doctor  when you re paying for law school  you re ultimately paying to become a lawyer  when i m paying for business school  what am i ultimately paying to become  for all the classes in accounting and financial analysis i ve taken here  how do i put this education on a balance sheet and assign a value to the mba  especially when many of the people in my prospective field don t have one  was this opportunity worth the opportunity cost  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s problematic being a bargain hunter and going to a business school that is particularly obsessed with numbers and data when there are so many parts of the mba experience that are near impossible to quantify  the teachers who irrevocably changed the way you see the world  the internship that broadened your lens of possibility and changed the course of your career as you knew it  the classmates who could be your cofounders tomorrow or ten years from now  the privilege of collaborating and making memories with diverse people from all over the world  all over the world  can you really put a price on something like this  especially when what people want and expect from their mba experience can vary so much from person to person </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if anyone can find the optimal price for the mba  it s someone at mit sloan  but i m not sure the value of an experience like this can be completely measured at least not in the same way that i can measure the value the snow boots i just bought to survive my next winter in boston </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but if my quantitative classes have taught me nothing else in business school  the reality of the situation is this </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  a wharton alum takes issue with fellow alum donald trump</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>presidential candidate donald trump has continued to grab headlines in the past week  most recently for his call for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on   his comments have drawn strong reactions  including from opponents such as philadelphia mayor michael nutter  who said in an address to the media tuesday   we have no place for that kind of ignorance and tolerance and lack of understanding of what our country is about  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>trump s supporters  too  have also been quite vocal  and his popularity in the polls continues  in a national telephone poll conducted december  th through   th by the new york times cbs news  seven in    voters likely to vote in the republican primary felt trump was well equipped to respond to the threat of terrorism  with four in    saying they were  very confident  in his response  in this category  trump led all other candidates  both democratic and republican </paragraph>
    <paragraph>trump  a      graduate of the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  has also drawn reactions from his fellow alums  nutter  wg      among them  this week in fridays from the frontlines  we re republishing an open letter about trump to wharton s dean and vice dean from victor lee  a      wharton mba graduate  in the letter  lee  who is a former co chair of the wharton mba ethics committee  takes issue with trump s statements  arguing that they violate the school s ethics code </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from the daily pennsylvanian  where it originally ran on december  th  with permission from its author  the views and opinions expressed are those of the author   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dear dean geoffrey garrett and vice dean howard kaufold </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in          i had the honor of serving as a co chair of the wharton mba ethics committee  i still remember vividly the standards to which we hold our students and community  to quote from the      mba resource guide  section  d   the wharton community is committed to an environment free from discrimination and harassment of any kind   our ethics code was created  to develop a sense of individual responsibility on the part of each member of the wharton community to participate actively in maintaining such standards  to foster an environment of honor and trust within the wharton community  and to engender respect for the ethical standards of the wharton graduate  fulfilling this mission is a collective responsibility of the members of the wharton community  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as an alumnus  i consider myself very much still part of the wharton community and am proud to have had the opportunity to study at our elite school  there is another alumnus who has proudly   and loudly   proclaimed his affiliation with wharton time and time again  donald trump  in efforts to suggest his intellectual prowess  mr  trump has repeatedly seized upon the prestige of the wharton brand  in doing so  however  he only reaffirms his obligation to uphold the ethical standards we expect from all members of the wharton community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mr  trump has prominently  and quite publicly  failed our community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he has repeatedly made a mockery of our ethics code and the values wharton holds dear  most recently and arguably most disturbingly  on dec     mr  trump called for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states    presumptively as a measure to inhibit terrorists from entering the united states  in this statement and others  mr  trump assigned malicious intent to a whole class of people  this is the very essence of discrimination  it is a violation of the wharton principle to  respect the individual rights of others  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mr  trump has forfeited his right to be a member of our wharton community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is not enough for wharton to stand silent in the face of such remarks by a former son of the school  how can we set an example for our current  future  and even former  students if we allow such statements to go unanswered with the requisite opprobrium </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i respectfully call upon both of you fine gentlemen  as leaders of our august school and protectors of the wharton brand  to lead the public disownment of donald trump as a member of the wharton family  we at wharton seek to raise ethical leaders  we cannot sit idly by but must proactively and publicly denounce mr  trump s statement and the philosophy that engenders his invective  it is our moral obligation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if we are to be a global leader  it is time for us   for wharton   to send a clear message to the world  enough is enough </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with respect and concern </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>to encourage members of the uc berkeley haas school of business community to take part in a campus wide online fundraiser last month  the school s dean broke into song  a music video of haas dean rich lyons playing guitar and singing  i m  going to haasland  to the tune of paul simon s  graceland  helped haas raise a record          as part of the uc berkeley wide      big give on november   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the big give is a    hour  campus wide online fundraiser now in its second year  in which different schools on the uc berkeley campus engage in friendly rivalry in an effort to best one another in terms of how much money they can drum up for their own schools  with     gifts in all  haas donors this year topped last year s total of          and came in second overall among all schools and departments  just behind the college of engineering  haas got an additional         in extra  big slice  funds for its second place finish  in all  the big give elicited       gifts totaling      million </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are so thankful for the tremendous support and enthusiasm we received from all of our generous donors this year   michelle mcclellan  assistant dean of berkeley haas development   alumni relations  said in a statement   the entire berkeley haas community came together to support programs  students and faculty  making this year s event even better than the last  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the theme of this year s fundraiser was  think bigger   and individual donors took to social media to post photos of themselves topped by thought bubbles filled in with their perspectives on how berkeley reaches beyond itself </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in his youtube music video  lyons starts out at his desk  with thought bubbles of his own over his head  musing about how he can inspire others to think bigger  dream bigger and imagine bigger  he then picks up his guitar and begins to strum  stroll and sing tailored lyrics extolling the school s nobel laureautes  acknowledging  self deprecatingly  that he doesn t have one yet   four founding principles and the talent and achievements of its alumnae </paragraph>
    <paragraph> when you give to the haas fund  it s like a window on your heart   he croons   everyone sees you ve done your part  everybody feels the spirit grow  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you haven t checked out the video  it s worth the three minute investment to get a better sense of the person at the helm of the haas school  but be forewarned  you re likely to wind up with the chorus  haasland  haasland  right here in  ole berkeley  we re going to haasland  stuck in your head </paragraph>

    <paragraph>peek weekend debuted in      as an all female affair  with     promising young women drawn from    women s colleges including barnard  wellesley  mills and mt  holyoke  response surprised organizers  who originally planned to target just a single school  barnard  and draw around    or so participants  leopold said  the purpose of the program was to offer current students from women s colleges a  peek  into what the harvard mba program is like in part to help drive greater female enrollment   hbs this year welcomed    percent women as part of its incoming class  up from    percent in      and    percent in       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an interview with clear admit just after the all women s weekend  leopold was thrilled with how successful it had been and intimated that the format could be expanded to include other groups of potential hbs applicants  now  in just its second year  the school appears to be doing just that </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the      peek weekend will again be open to applicants from women s colleges  but it will also include two additional cohorts  one made up of stem majors and another made up of students who come from a family owned business background  each cohort will have its own specific curriculum  but the entire group will come together as part of joint sessions for all peek participants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an introduction to the hbs case method last year  a big part of the peek weekend focus was on introducing participants to hbs s signature case method  leopold was reluctant to talk about the event before it took place  unsure of how successful it would prove   we just didn t know   she said   can we get the case method to really cook  really bubble in such a short time with people who haven t done it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pilot group of women dove right in  embracing the case method with ease   i was blown away by how engaged and thoughtful they were   said frances x  frei  hbs professor of service management and senior associate dean for faculty planning and recruiting  who taught a case on tessei  a company that provides cleaning services for japan s bullet trains </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i immediately fell in love with the case method it was a huge part of the great experience i had there   said catherine cousins  who was a rising senior at mills college in california when she took part   i just assumed  based on my economics background that it would be really quant heavy  i was expecting numbers and statistics and excel  but the case method was so much more than just how the numbers change   she said </paragraph>

  <title>ucla anderson mba alum wants to help de clutter your life</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ucla anderson school of management mba program grad brian thomas was still a student when he raised the money to start his business  clutter  a self storage company that offers a mobile app and customized packing and delivery services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thomas has described clutter to be  as convenient as pizza delivery   thomas and his partner ari mir recently raised    million in order to take the company from a local venture to a nationwide business  as noted in a recent wall street journal article </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>clutter is unique when compared to other self storage companies  in that it sublets space in existing industrial buildings as opposed to building its own spaces  not only is this a sensible business strategy  but it s also a sustainable solution in terms of eliminating sprawl and building waste  another element of clutter s business model that differentiates it from similar services is the offering of an online visual inventory of one s items  which promotes ease of retrieval should one decide to have an item delivered </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thomas noted   i wanted a visual inventory of everything i had in storage and an easy way to have my things delivered to me i want to help people be smarter about storage by making it easy to access and enjoy their things  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clutter recently offered a special to ucla students and plans to do so again as it expands into a larger nationwide area  the company offers plans for as low as       a month for a small number of items and      per month for a garage sized space </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  kellogg first year reflects on the talent of her classmates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as those of us here in the united states attempt to work off hearty thanksgiving meals  some are still reflecting on the things for which we re thankful  in that spirit  our fridays from the frontline post today comes from nikita sunilkumar  a first year mba student at northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sunilkumar  a california native who worked as a production engineer at boeing before business school  entered kellogg as part of a record breaking class made up of    percent women  as she shares here  she took part in an eye opening exercise as part of the school s women s business association led by kellogg professor victoria medvec  one designed to help participants recognize and appreciate the remarkable talent of their classmates  our thanks to sunilkumar for sharing her thoughts and for business schools across the globe working toward gender parity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post was republished in its entirety from the inside perspective  kellogg s full time mba student blog   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s a statistic that has floated around since orientation and pre term  but i think it bears repeating  the kellogg class of      has a record percentage of female students  and at    percent of an incoming class of      those students are poised to make a big impact  i had a chance to feel this impact quite viscerally when i walked into the allen center a few weeks ago for the first annual women s welcome event hosted by the women s business association  wba  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all the spectacular diversity among my classmates was on full display  bright voices and smiles filled the room as greetings were exchanged between old friends and new  introductions were made among those from vastly different professional and personal backgrounds in a cacophony of accents and languages  and the somber black suits of a stereotypical business meeting were replaced with a riot of color and style </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i would have been hard pressed to find any one characteristic to fully define the group around me  at least until professor victoria medvec stood up to lead us in an exercise  she noted that women often don t voice their own accomplishments in business settings as often as men do  and challenged each of us to introduce ourselves to the student seated alongside us by emphasizing our unique strengths </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prof  medvec reconvened the group and asked students to highlight their neighbors and share these accomplishments with the whole room  as each student spoke up  it became clear we were all united by a common theme  talent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among our ranks we have highly accomplished managers  consultants  bankers  scientists  veterans and other professionals  and each person at that first wba meeting is someone i can t wait to get to know better over the next two years  certainly part of my motivation is wanting to build a strong professional network among my peers  but i m mostly excited about being around the kind of people i met at the allen center that day  friendly  enthusiastic and generous about sharing their successes while promoting and supporting each other </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the weeks have passed i am happy to say that my initial impressions have only deepened  the kellogg culture is truly  high impact and low ego   as promised </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each new conversation reveals something interesting or admirable about a classmate or a faculty member  questions for information are never ignored and offers to share more are always forthcoming  there is no shortage of inspiration  from second years and the many projects they have undertaken within and outside the kellogg community  to the faculty and administration  who clearly share a high regard for each other as well as the work that they do </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the days pass  i find that i hardly notice how many amazing women are part of the kellogg community  and i m impressed by that most of all  when so many business and institutions struggle with creating a culture of inclusion  the fact that it seems so effortless at kellogg is both uplifting and inspiring  i look forward to doing my part in keeping this particular kellogg  tradition  alive and well for future students </paragraph>

  <title>livewire data offers insight into mit sloan  stanford gsb interview invitations</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in recent weeks  clear admit s mba livewire has continued to be on fire with submissions from applicants making their way through the round   application process at top schools  we ve received reports regarding a great many schools including columbia business school  oxford s said business school  nyu stern and cornell s johnson school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for today  though  our data analysis will focus on mit sloan and stanford graduate school of business  gsb   whose interview invitations and rejections have given scores of livewire participants cause for elation or despair </paragraph>
    <paragraph>livewire action began to intensify for mit sloan late last month  so let s take a look first at those results </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those who were invited to interview  reported gpa ranged from an outlying      to      with an average of       the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      notably  the ranges and averages were much the same for those who got a ding   the gpa range was also similar       to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of       roughly    percent of those who reported their mit sloan fates via livewire got a ding  with the other    percent happily sharing that they d been invited to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as with our analysis of hbs and chicago booth livewire data a few weeks back  conclusions to be drawn here are basically that almost everyone has great stats  so it is more than simply a stellar gpa or gmat score that gets someone an interview invitation  notably  mit sloan did seem willing to interview a few candidates whose gpa or gmat fell outside of the top cluster  presumably because other components of their application were particularly compelling </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here again  we need to note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who scored well on the gmat or had strong gpas may be more inclined to share their numbers publicly  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>moving on to stanford reveals similar patterns  here  reported gpas for applicants who have received an invitation to interview ranged from      to       with an average of       gmat scores  meanwhile  fell between     and      with an average score of      for those who got dinged  gpas ranged from      to       averaging       and gmat scores ranged from     to      with an average of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with stanford gsb data  as with the data regarding mit sloan applicants  the sample size was small and selection bias may also be at play  interestingly  though  with stanford  reports of rejections made to livewire dwarfed reports of interview invites  four out of five applicants who reported their fates via livewire got a ding from stanford </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as you make your way through your interviews for those of you who fell into that desirable camp be sure to keep us posted on how it goes  if you re still prepping  don t forget clear admit s interviews guides for mit sloan and stanford  which can help you prepare  thanks for sharing your results via clear admit s livewire  keep  em coming </paragraph>

  <title>new england patriots owner robert kraft pledges     million to hbs to advance precision medicine</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the robert and myra kraft family foundation  inc  has pledged     million to create a new endowment at harvard business school  hbs  to advance precision medicine  the school announced yesterday  foundation president robert k  kraft  a      hbs mba graduate and current owner of the new england patriots nfl team  was in attendance at the partners precision medicine conference wednesday at harvard medical school  where the announcement was made  the pledge comes as part of harvard university s      billion capital campaign </paragraph>
    <paragraph>using business to narrow the gap between scientific discoveries and medical solutions the kraft endowment for advancing precision medicine will support research and other activities to advance the field of precision medicine  a growing movement in patient care allowing scientists and physicians to use genomic information to understand a disease based on its biological mechanisms  using the human genome in this way could allow for more precise diagnoses and more tailored treatments of serious diseases </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gaps between scientific discoveries and the development and commercialization of medical solutions to help the public has slowed growth in the industry  as have rising costs of clinical trials and too little collaboration between scientists  the pharmaceutical industry and investors  hbs  in partnership with precision medicine pioneer the broad institute  hopes the new kraft endowment will contribute not only to accelerating advancements in precision medicine but also to fast tracking commercialization of these solutions to help them reach those who need them most </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a personal pledge</paragraph>
    <paragraph>kraft s pledge to his alma mater  where several of his sons also studied  is a very personal investment  his wife  myra kraft  died of ovarian cancer in       during her illness  the kraft family came to understand the promise of precision medicine through frequent consultation with broad institute director dr  eric s  lander  a professor at both mit and harvard medical school and a former member of the hbs faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the kraft family has long been a standard bearer in boston s business and philanthropic communities   harvard university president drew gilpin faust said in a statement   this extraordinary gift continues that tradition in a way that will have a huge impact on generations to come  contributing to the quality of life for many people around the globe by alleviating the pain and suffering caused by a wide array of serious illnesses  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>precision medicine advancement faces business challenges that the kraft pledge goes to hbs  rather than to harvard medical school  is about more than just school loyalty   at heart  many of the challenges facing the advancement of precision medicine today are business challenges   hbs dean nitin nohria said in a statement  he added that he is honored that the krafts  see the potential for hbs to work with world class organizations like the broad to develop innovative and integrative new models from organizational structures to collaborative data centers that will position boston at the epicenter of this arena in the future  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>already  two pilot research projects designed to accelerate the discovery and trials process are set to begin in coming months  the first  a precision trials challenge  will challenge the medical and scientific community to use precision medicine techniques to find ways to cut the cost and time required to execute clinical trials  the second pilot will use crowdsourcing contests to try to break through data bottlenecks to solve and scale precision medicine solutions for both clinical and commercial use </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many future activities are also being developed to help address challenges and seize opportunities in precision medicine  a few of them </paragraph>

  <title>the big decision  choosing an evening mba program</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as decision time neared for her mba enrollment  anjali shahani was leaning toward the mba evening program at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  she was originally pursuing a part time program to retain her position at the highly coveted world bank group  like any good researcher  she attended information sessions and joined various club events all of which provided her new insights that shifted her plan </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i m generally passionate about what i do and active in my community   says shahani   i decided if i was going to be a part of georgetown  i wanted to be an active member  participating in extracurricular activities although not impossible is definitely more challenging when you are combining studies and a full time job  i realized i would not be able to fully commit to both  plus maintain the balance i wanted in my personal life  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that epiphany led shahani to enroll in georgetown s full time mba program a decision she feels was best for her professional and personal goals  she will graduate as part of the mcdonough full time mba class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her story exemplifies how important both school research and a dose of soul searching can be in identifying the right mba program for you  for many  simply deciding to pursue an mba is a triumph  followed by a careful process of narrowing down a list of multiple schools to the one that fits you best </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but even after you have selected a school  choosing between full time or part time studies can be one of the biggest decisions mba candidates make </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i took my time   says leslie ogden  a member of mcdonough s evening program class of        i fully researched both programs and carefully considered what i want my career to look like and where my passion lies  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after applying and being admitted to a full time program at another top ranked u s  business school  ogden opted for mcdonough s mba evening program  which is now ranked fourth by bloomberg businessweek  studying part time would enable her to keep a full time job as an assistant vice president at her political advocacy organization where she has experienced strong professional growth and personal fulfillment something she decided was vital to her </paragraph>
    <paragraph>matt mcelhare made a similar discovery in his own mba considerations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the idea that the evening program allows additional time as a three year program instead of two was very appealing   said mcelhare  a member of the class of        the extra three years of work experience  obtained while completing the degree  has allowed me to apply what i m learning in real time and to continue to grow  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like others in his cohort  mcelhare found that both programs offered the same quality education and the opportunity to still consult for an international company through the global business experience something that is rare among part time mba programs  plus  the opportunity to retain his job at jacobs engineering group also significantly reduced the opportunity cost associated with obtaining his degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the evening program curriculum mirrors the full time curriculum  and the program office does a great job of making sure that the same incredible professors teach modules in the daytime and in the evening  the evening program also has the same access to the mba career center   he says   but for me  maintaining an income throughout the program tilted the scale in favor of the evening program  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how best to strike a balance between working toward an mba and continuing to progress in your career can differ from candidate to candidate  but most agree that mcdonough s location played a huge role in their decision making  the intersection of business and policy in washington  d c  and in particular at georgetown mcdonough was a big factor for many </paragraph>
    <paragraph> not only does my professional network continue to grow every day by virtue of living and working in d c    says ogden   but just by being in this program and going to class  i m meeting incredibly talented individuals who i otherwise would not have had the opportunity to know  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the school s mba career center  top global companies host on campus events  often thanks to the strong network of         georgetown university alumni  in addition to lectures  roundtable discussions and networking receptions  student leaders also coordinate career days that offer students a sample  day in the life  for different industries  and then there are career treks to various employers either in the nation s capital or to sites in global hubs like new york  san francisco  london and hong kong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective students mulling over a full time versus a part time or evening mba program also are wise to factor in their own on campus ambitions  many know before they even apply that they will join student government and other extra curricular clubs or teams  while others find unexpected opportunities along the way  mcelhare  evening student government association  esga  vice president  said that esga has created resources to allow evening students to dial in via a conference call to mid day mba club meetings so that evening students can participate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at mcdonough  that may include any of more than    student run cultural  interest based  service  recreational and student government organizations from the georgetown mba entrepreneurship club or women in business to the outdoors club or georgetown wine society </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for shahani  the final decision to go the full time route was based on logic that evening program candidates can appreciate  too  being able take advantage of all that georgetown has to offer  but above all  gaining a quality education </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my classes  although very challenging  are also entertaining and fun  i visited other universities  but i only applied to georgetown   she says   it was my first and only choice  and i was very lucky to be accepted  </paragraph>

  <title>bloomberg businessweek rankings data reveal high cost of mba networking</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>while most who are contemplating an mba at a leading business school are well aware of the steep costs of tuition and foregone earnings  the budget line item for  extras  is sometimes overlooked  bloomberg businessweek  as part of its annual ranking of full time mba programs  asked students from the class of      just what they spend on nonessential items  the findings  the more prestigious the school  the higher the cost of networking </paragraph>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs   which was number one in bloomberg bw s most recent overall rankings  also topped the charts in terms of students  median expenditure on nonessential items  at         </paragraph>
    <paragraph>median spend on extras by students at stanford graduate school of business was second highest  also north of          the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and columbia business school weren t far behind  at more than         each </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg bw notes that it shifted this year from reporting average expenditure to median spend at each school  in part to  smooth out outliers  like that one charge card happy student who goes on every school trip   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>trips certainly account for a large share of the nonessential spending mba students go in for  from the field global immersion requirement for all hbs first year students to nyu stern s entertainment media and technology association  emta  trek to silicon valley  it s hard to find a leading business school today where group trips across the country or around the globe aren t an integral part of the curriculum or the job search or both  there are also lots of non academic travel opportunities as well  such as kellogg worldwide experience   service trips  kwest   which bring kellogg mbas together for social  sight seeing and community service expeditions to places ranging from malaysia to chile to turkey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>professional clubs  too  which include annual membership fees  ticketed events and more  can also put a dent in business school students  bank accounts  of course  there are the arguably more frivolous club related expenses as well  such as wine tasting with the chicago booth wine club or ski passes as part of membership in mit sloan s ski and snowboarding club </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but whether as part of a class related consulting project in india  a job scouting trek to visit cpg firms in chicago or an expensive dinner at per se with cbs s gourmet club  the network building opportunities common to all of these activities can be a valuable part of the overall business school experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  prospective mba applicants targeting leading schools would do well to budget for expenses beyond tuition and fees  still  there are ways to take part in valuable mba networking opportunities without splurging at every turn </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cbs student victor eng secured his summer internship through a relationship forged with a ceo who came to one of this classes to speak   there are lots of ways money isn t a limiting factor in business school   he told bloomberg bw   you just have to be more strategic than others about what you say yes to  </paragraph>

  <title>veterans at mit sloan on how their service prepared them for business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>what does a navy fast attack submarine officer who spent months at a time at the bottom of the ocean have to contribute to class conversation at an elite business school  plenty  it turns out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brian kirk      graduated from penn state with a degree in mechanical engineering before attending officer training school in rhode island to earn his commission in the u s  navy  after a year and half in the navy s nuclear training pipeline  he served on board the uss louisville as part of a western pacific deployment and in its home port of pearl harbor  there was not a single gmat prep course in his path  and yet  today  he is a member of the mba class of      at mit sloan school of management where he fits right in </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several factors led kirk to service in the navy   it was something i felt compelled to do   he says   i felt like i needed to serve in some regard to support this country and the constitution that i believed in so much   but he also wanted to see the world  and there was a degree of sexiness and bravado that appealed to him  too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so how did he get from there to mit sloan  the military life wasn t right for his family for the long term  he says   my wife is incredibly intelligent and definitely deserves a rewarding career of her own  which was not likely to happen if i were to stay in the military   he knew he could lead he d been in charge of     people when he was driving the ship but he needed to  bridge the gap to reality   he says   an mba called to me as a way to learn the hard business skills i would need to go out and run an organization or be my own boss one day  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he and his wife set to work applying to school business schools for him and physical therapy programs for her hoping to both get into top programs in the same city  it came down to a decision between boston and chicago and between mba programs at sloan and northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to hear him tell it  he settled on sloan somewhat reluctantly   it was at the bottom of my list and i chose it just for the convenience of being in the same town as my wife and being high in the rankings   he confesses  with apologies to the admissions office   submariners are notoriously geeky  somewhat introverted  odd personalities   he says   we don t see the sun very much   he adds with a laugh </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for business school  he wanted something different  he wanted to be around outspoken  outgoing people and be forced to use the other side of his brain  surely  sloan wasn t this place  or so he thought </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the first time i got here for admit weekend i could tell that everything i thought about mit as being a tech house was wrong   he says  instead of a bunch of geeky introverts  he found a community of outgoing  extroverted high achievers that enjoys being around each other and learning from each other   in the end it all just landed perfectly i wound up in exactly the place i was supposed to be and that was just sheer good luck  </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  conquering fomo at insead</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>watching livewire  we ve seen lots of insead interview action in the past few weeks  including this disappointed but determined post from an india applicant in malta who didn t get an invitation   spent all of summer in pursuit of insead   he or she wrote   heartbroken but not fallen yet    cue a collective  aww  in the clear admit office  keep calm and stay positive </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in today s fridays from the frontline  we hear from someone who did make the cut at insead only to arrive on campus and confront a challenge of a whole new sort  fomo  or fear of missing out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are just so many amazing and fascinating events and activities taking place all the time as part of insead s warp speed     month mba program that it can be hard not to fixate on what you re missing out on in any given moment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>victor lamm found himself in just that position when he began his mba program at insead this past fall  suspecting that others might be wrestling with similar struggles  he wrote a funny and insightful blog post for the  insead mba experience  student blog  which he s graciously allowed us to repost here for clear admit readers to enjoy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a division i tennis player in college  lamm earned an ms in sports business from new york university  coaching the men s tennis team in the process   he also has worked in communications for several leading sports organizations  including the french tennis federation  the alltech fei world equestrian games and the lagard re paris racing  a prestigious european tennis club  at insead  he is studying marketing  strategy  entrepreneurship and management with the goal of becoming a leader in tomorrow s sports industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>read on to learn some of the strategies he s developed to combat fomo  which while perhaps even more pronounced at insead and other one year mba programs  can be a common phenomenon at any business school given the frenetic pace and unfathomably limitless number of opportunities that confront mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  the insead mba experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we ve learned many colloquialisms since we stepped foot on the insead campus  breakout rooms  dash  splash  renaissance  lunch roulette  fonty  but one word seems to stand out though  fomo a k a  fear of missing out  there s no cure for it  but here are a few ways we can try to avoid it  or at least suffer less from it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   accept that we cannot do everything</paragraph>
    <paragraph>no matter how well we allocate our time  we will not be able to do everything  what s the solution then  well it s actually very simple  realize and accept that we just cannot do everything we want in a given day </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there s just simply not enough time to do it all  last time i checked  there was    hours in a day  if we account six hours of class on average  seven to eight hours to sleep     minutes to brush our teeth  do not save time on this      minutes to shower  same as the toothbrush      minutes of commuting    hours to eat  we have only around   or   hours for professional clubs  company presentations  leisure time  and social stuff  that s not that much </paragraph>
    <paragraph>which makes me move to my next point  we all have to prioritize at some point </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   prioritize</paragraph>
    <paragraph>i heard that we could be hunters or explorers  lions or gazelles  no matter who we are  what we do  we won t be able to do it all anyway  so what do we have to do  prioritize  when we feel rushed and pressured to do it all  let s take a step back and remind ourselves why we came to insead in the first place </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maybe it s     have fun     get better at ping pong     find a job  i m not sure if these are the right priorities  but maybe it s really yours  it s not quite mine  i would put ping pong first   but i respect it because there s no right or wrong answer to that question  the most important thing is to be clear on what we want  and to make choices according to those priorities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s just like the everest assignment  to reach the everest  we couldn t let the photographer take his stupid pictures at levels one and two  we have to see the big picture and make compromises to reach the top </paragraph>

  <title>new forte data shows impressive gains in female mba enrollment</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>women make up at least    percent of the mba class at    leading u s  business schools this year  compared to just five last year  according to new data released today by the forte foundation  a nonprofit consortium of business schools and companies working to increase opportunities for women in business </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in       less than a third of mba students were women  today we re inching closer to    percent in the united states and working to close the gap significantly in another five years   says forte executive director elissa sangster   every percentage point gain is not only hard earned  but something to celebrate  and should go a long way in building the senior leadership pipeline at companies and on boards   she continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the u s  schools leading the charge to increase female mba enrollment are dartmouth s tuck school of business  harvard business school  mit sloan school of management  northwestern s kellogg school of management  uc berkeley s haas school of business  the university of chicago booth school  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and the yale school of management  all of which topped    percent this year  sixteen forte u s  member schools this year have at least    percent female enrollment  up from just three a decade ago </paragraph>
    <paragraph> forte was launched in      to address the then stark underrepresentation of women in top business schools as compared to medical or law schools  today  it has grown to    member schools in the united states  canada and europe and spearheads multiple initiatives aimed at closing the gender gap as it relates to pursuing an mba and careers in business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the organization s many initiatives is the forte fellows program  through which exceptional female mba students are awarded scholarships by participating member schools to offset the cost of business school  these scholarships have grown from    in      to more than     for the incoming class of       totaling more than     million in aid to date </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it also hosts two annual conferences  the forte mba women s leadership conference  which draws together hundreds of women mbas and top companies  and the forte college to business leadership conference  designed to introduce undergraduate freshmen and sophomore women to business related summer internships and entry level jobs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sangster credits the forte forums  one of the organization s longest running programs  for perhaps having the greatest impact on helping increase female mba enrollment  these free events  held each fall in cities across the united states  canada and the united kingdom  introduce talented young women to business school representatives  mba alumnae and one another to raise awareness of the mba degree and what it offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we have had such amazing support from our business school partners in promoting it and hitting up their alumni ranks to share their inspirational stories   she tells clear admit   it s clear when women are leaving these forums that they have had a life changing event  not only because of the people they have gotten to meet but also because they have realized they are not alone that there are so many other women out there just like them   she says  every year forte reaches between five and six thousand women about the mba through its marketing around these events   that has pretty strong implications for changing the tide  and we are seeing increases in audience every year we have done them   she says </paragraph>

  <title>gmac launches new tuition assistance tool to help mba applicants research financial aid</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the graduate management admission council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmat entrance exam for business school admissions  has launched a new interactive tool designed to help prospective mba applicants better understand the types of financial aid and tuition assistance offered by business schools in different regions of the world  gmac designed the tool using survey data collected from    business schools as part of its      application trends survey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective gmat test takers worldwide cite the challenges of financing the mba as by far the greatest obstacles to pursuing the degree  according to gmac s      prospective students survey report  nearly half     percent  cite the fact that a graduate business degree requires more money than is available as a major reservation  and    percent say the same about the prospect of incurring large financial debt as part of obtaining the degree   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in response  gmac created this new tool  which allows prospective applicants to indicate the region and type of business school program they are interested in and then serves up a bar chart reflecting what percentage of those programs offer various types of tuition assistance </paragraph>
    <paragraph> defined broadly  tuition assistance programs include any kind of initiative undertaken by a graduate business school to help students cover the cost of tuition   gmac notes  in response to the survey  business schools reported offering a full spectrum of programs  including merit  and need based scholarships  fellowships and stipends  and work study and assistantship opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>globally     percent of the business school programs surveyed offer some form of merit based scholarships  narrow your search terms more  and the results shift  for example  a greater percentage of u s  two year mba programs    percent offer merit based aid  but among online mba programs surveyed  only    percent do </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in addition to one  and two year mba programs  the tool also parses survey data for a range of specialized masters programs  including masters of management  finance  accounting  supply chain management  marketing and data analytics  global data is also available for part time  flexible and executive mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the tool provides just a very basic starting point for the investigation of financial aid options for the mba   reach out to the schools you re interested in and ask them about what kind of assistance is available to you   gmac advises  but having this insight into the relative distribution of different types of tuition assistance could help prospective applicants decide where and what types of programs make the most sense for them  it also gives applicants an understanding of the full landscape of tuition assistance available  better equipping them to plan how to pay for school and to fully explore all available options as part of the application process </paragraph>

    <paragraph>here s what we know from past admissions cycles at wharton  historically  wharton has typically interviewed roughly    percent of applicants to the mba program  though this does vary depending on application volume  selectivity has generally fallen between    percent and    percent in recent years  which suggests that you can assume a roughly one in three chance of admission if invited for an interview  of course  these are all based on past application seasons  and wharton could change things up at any point </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the written interview invitation  wharton has sometimes asked some applicants to improve their test scores and quantitative skills  if you receive such a request  we strongly recommend that you take the necessary steps  such as signing up for a course or registering to retake the gmat  to address that feedback before your interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as wharton hopefuls no doubt know  the school s interview consists of a team based discussion  tbd   followed by a brief one on one meeting with an admissions representative  read more about the tbd and how to prepare here  you can also gain some insight on the tbd from our admissions director q a with wharton s frank devecchis </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton offers round   interviewers the option of interviewing on campus in philadelphia or in a range of major cities around the world  off campus interviews will take place this year in beijing  dubai  london  mumbai  san francisco  sao paulo  seoul  singapore and tokyo   we encourage all invited candidates to interview in the location that is most convenient for you whether in philly or one of our off campus locations   reads the wharton website </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  mba mama on pitching as a female entrepreneur</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week in our fridays from the frontline series  we are delighted to have as our contributor divinity matovu  a first year mba student at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  matovu  whose focus at wharton is on entrepreneurial management and finance  also happens to be a mother of two and the co founder and president of mba mama  an online platform where millennial moms can find the products  services  tools and inspiration they need to pursue an mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her passion for start ups  she s launched four of her own  and women s empowerment shines through in the following post  where she shares a recent experience she had pitching to an all male panel as part of wharton s venture initiation program  vip   her spirit and pluck are evident as well  even amid everything else she s doing  she finds time to blog regularly check out her posts to learn more about some of her other passions  including technology  financial inclusion and african affairs  we re grateful to divinity for lending her voice and perspective to our series </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  mba mama blog  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i don t even know how to ask you questions without sounding like a jerk   this is how the man judging my pitch for mba mama started my   minute q a session yesterday  sensing a tinge of condescension and sarcasm in his voice  i was startled but tried not to show my discomfort  during a series of pitches for wharton s venture initiation program  the judges took a  shark tank  style approach to q a  frequently cutting people off mid sentence and firing off tough questions  my experience was slightly different given that the first words from this particular judge did not propose a question but instead suggested that any feedback or questioning of my ideas meant the judge was being a  jerk   i find this to be fascinating  i plan to spend some time over the next few weeks reflecting on how this all went down  i ll also be archiving the recording of the pitch session to better prepare myself for future experiences like this one </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i found out earlier today that i did not get selected to be part of wharton vip  while this is not unusual given that vip is highly competitive  i wonder how my gender and the gendered focus of my business may have played a role in the tone and direction of the questions i received from the all male panel of judges  interestingly enough  i practiced my pitch during my communications class at wharton and had a male classmate tell me that mba mama is a nice idea but he would not support the business because more mba moms in business schools means less spots for men like him   sideeye</paragraph>
    <paragraph>we would all like to believe that entrepreneurship is a meritocracy where people are judged solely on the viability of their ideas  however  research from professors like laura huang of wharton indicates that investors have a strong bias towards funding and supporting male founders  i just read a case in my entrepreneurship class that talked about the challenges the founders of rent the runway faced trying to convince male vcs a generation removed that they had a viable business aimed at college women  the fact of the matter is that gender biases are prevalent in the entrepreneurial funding landscape and impact the level of support female founders receive  numerous studies show that the number of women in the venture capital industry continues to be abysmal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an entrepreneur i admire very much is commonbond ceo david klein  he famously tells the story of how he was rejected from wharton vip not once  but twice  last month  commonbond announced a series b funding round of     million  meanwhile  there are student ventures that won vip on the first try but have long been abandoned by their founders  clearly  getting rejected by vip is not an indicator of success for student entrepreneurs  this gives me hope that with continued hard work and dedication  i can take mba mama to the next level </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to be clear  i am not saying the judges were biased   or that i deserved to be selected for vip during this application cycle  i know that  despite our traction in the six months since we launched  i need to better communicate our vision to revolutionize the experience of women in the workplace  i also need to do more work to narrow down our target market and refine our monetization plan  i am working on it  and feel grateful to be at wharton where there are numerous opportunities to pivot  innovate and iterate on my ideas  this is also not my first rodeo  i ve founded three other companies and know that it takes grit  scrappiness and determination to be successful as an entrepreneur </paragraph>
    <paragraph>pitching to vip reminded me that the journey ahead will be challenging  me and my business partner  nicole  will likely face many more all male panels  these men hold the checkbooks and the access code to prestigious venture accelerators  it is also relevant that i am a black woman  and nicole is a latina  this presents another unique set of challenges as there are very few people who look like us prepared to make deals that could give mba mama the financing and backing we need to scale </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite the odds against us  mba mama is positioning ourselves to disrupt a work culture where millions of women  especially moms  lack the confidence to apply to business school and lean in to their careers and their destiny  not to mention nearly    percent of highly skilled moms are not working full time or utilizing their elite mba degrees  this presents an incredible market opportunity to empower women and boost global economies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>addressing institutional problems like gender inequality and gender bias that are deeply entrenched in our society is tough work  convincing people that it can be done is even harder  obstacles abound but i am not deterred  i feel confident about the potential for this company and i plan to apply for vip again in the spring  i want to thank all of our subscribers and supporters for continuing to believe in our vision  onward  upward </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  i m going to have a dance party to beyonce with my daughter to celebrate the opportunity to grow  learn  and improve  never give up ladies </paragraph>

  <title>professor perspectives  kellogg professor paul christensen</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>class size  rankings  career placement statistics  location these are all factors that inevitably play a part in where you decide to attend business school  and with good reason  but another vital consideration should be the professors with whom you ll study  the right business school professor can have enormous impact not only on what you learn during your mba but also on the future course of your career </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to help introduce you to some of the leading professors at the world s best business schools  we re launching this new series called professor perspectives  in it  we ll showcase leading instructors from a range of mba programs  their groundbreaking work  their unique teaching styles and more  to kick things off  we d like to introduce you to paul christensen  a clinical professor of finance at northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>christensen teaches courses in microfinance and international business at kellogg and also serves as the academic director for the school s global study programs  immersion experiences that introduce kellogg mba students to international business and markets  prior to joining kellogg in       he was founder and president of shorecap international ltd   a     million london based private equity company that invests in financial institutions in developing countries throughout asia  africa and eastern europe </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a post today on the inside perspective  kellogg s full time mba blog  christensen answered questions about what he teaches  why he teaches and what he hopes students glean from his courses  he also provides some specific advice for prospective applicants considering the kellogg mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what christensen teaches  microfinance is the reason i am at kellogg   he writes  noting that he was first invited to teach this course as an adjunct professor before taking on a full time role at the school  in his microfinance course  he leads students through an examination of the role that development financial institutions play in emerging markets  including helping people access credit  savings and other basic financial services that can improve their lives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>christensen also teaches kellogg s global initiatives in management  gim  classes  as well as an experiential learning course called global lab  in which mba student teams complete project work with overseas organizations  generally involving strategy or marketing   i haven t taught that class recently  but someday i hope to return to it because it s fun to work with students and help them apply what they are learning here at kellogg   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i like to provide students with new insights and understandings into the way that business and capital markets are truly global these days   christensen shares  for example  in his microfinance course he demonstrates the role that national banks and capital markets play by providing capital to support microfinance loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he also likes for his students to develop an appreciation of how business can be a force for social good  he writes  noting that most microfinance organizations have transformed from ngos or non profits to socially motivated  for profit institutions  but examples extend beyond microfinance  he continues   china  for example  has lifted more people out of poverty through industrialization and business expansion that any other country in history   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  he wants to prepare his students to be managers in overseas settings   managers need to pay close attention to the local culture and customs  the difference in working styles and personalities  because without that sensitivity  even the best managers can wind up falling prey to ugly prejudices or simply be ineffective   he writes  to this end  as academic director of kellogg s global programs  christensen has been working with students and staff to identify online cultural awareness intelligence tools that let students test their awareness of a given local culture before they go  as well as how business practices differ between countries  his goal is to see such tools implemented school wide one day </paragraph>

  <title>big shoes to fill at hbs as dee leopold announces plans to step down</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>dee leopold  who has helmed admissions at harvard business school  hbs  for the past decade  will handpick her last class at the school as part of this admissions season  confirming reports that began circulating after an email yesterday to the hbs community from jana kierstead  executive director of harvard s mba program  leopold herself took to her  direct from the director  blog today to share the news with prospective applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s been a fabulous ten years   she wrote   this is a great job and hbs is an amazing place to build a career  i m ready for something new and it s a privilege to have senior leadership that helps navigate change  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her departure will not impact this year s admissions cycle  she stressed   i am here on the job until the class of       that s you   is all set and ready to go   she wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a class act alex brown  who worked in admissions at wharton for years and now serves as a consultant for clear admit  was impressed by leopold s blog post   it s a nice touch to reach out to the applicants and be so forthright   he said  in fact  leopold has helped revolutionize mba admissions at harvard and more broadly  in part through the transparency she s offered into the process through her blog and otherwise </paragraph>
    <paragraph> dee leopold has not only transformed the admissions process at harvard business school  she has helped shape today s admissions process at many leading mba programs across the globe   says graham richmond  a clear admit co founder who has gone on to launch his own firm advising admissions offices themselves   before dee took the reigns as director  the school was infamous for a highly opaque admissions process with many referring to admissions at hbs as a  black box    he continues   under her watch  hbs admissions charted an entirely different course and introduced a level of transparency and frankness heretofore unknown in mba admissions  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the changes leopold helped implement were the prompt issuing of interview invitations in batches on set days and the  release  of candidates not invited to interview on a fixed date earlier in the process so that they can regroup and pursue other options  richmond points out   perhaps most notably  hbs reduced the number of required essays drastically and sought to make the on campus interview process a first class experience  offering specialized side activities for prospective students to take part in during their campus stay   he adds </paragraph>

  <title>darden hosts inaugural diversity week</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last week  the darden school of business at the university of virginia hosted five full days of events  panels and workshops devoted to exploring the challenges and benefits of diversity in business  the darden student association  dsa  and the diversity student advisory group  dsag  helped launch this inaugural darden diversity week as part of an effort to place discussion of diversity related issues front and center within the darden community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the idea for a week focused on diversity was first raised by darden s student liaisons from the consortium for graduate study in management  a nonprofit organization devoted to increasing the representation of african americans  hispanic americans and native americans in business schools and corporate management  the suggestion  coming on the heels of a year in which a range of events focused the nation s attention on both race relations and marriage equality  was readily embraced by the dsa s first ever vice president of diversity  second year mba student patricia martin  previously  the dsa had a single vice president for both diversity and international students  but in recognition of the fact that the needs of the two groups are different  the roles were broken apart this past year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one of my main goals in this new position was to take a more proactive approach to discussing diversity   martin says  acknowledging that several campus affinity groups did host discussions around diversity last year in reaction to national events   i really wanted to think about incorporating diversity into the darden fabric in a more proactive way   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and so diversity week was born  when approached by the consortium student liaisons with the idea at the end of last year  martin suggested that responsibility for coordinating the week s events fall to the vp of diversity so that it would involve the entire darden community and have continuity from one year to the next  working closely with dsag  the consortium student liaisons and numerous other campus affinity groups  martin scheduled a week full of events devoted to diversity in all of its forms  including ethnicity  gender  nationality  thought  culture and religion all with a focus on its impact on business </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is what businesses and corporations are thinking about  and we wanted to make sure that darden students are exposed to these issues before they go to their internships and jobs   martin says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>events each day explore different diversity issues the week s programming kicked off with a first coffee on monday morning  followed by a panel discussion on education inequality and the stem  science  technology  engineering  math  pipeline led by representatives from hewlett packard and boston consulting group  co sponsors included the black business student forum  bbsf   hispanic american network at darden  the technology club and the education club </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on tuesday  darden s own professor martin davidson led a workshop on leveraging difference  helping participants think about how to talk about diversity without getting stuck in political correctness  the workshop was delivered in two sessions  one for first year students and a second for second year students  faculty and staff   professor davidson is an expert in the field of leveraging diversity and having uncomfortable conversations in all areas diversity of race  thought  backgrounds  he helped us learn how to break down barriers and be a bit more vulnerable to people  which allows you to have more difficult discussions   martin says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another panel focused on lgbtq policies  specifically on how to attract and retain lgbtq talent  this panel  co sponsored by pride at darden  included representatives from mckinsey and johnson   johnson  graduate women in business and the finance club co sponsored their own panel on women in finance  drawing representatives from amazon  goldman sachs  harris william and j p  morgan </paragraph>
    <paragraph>participation from so many high profile companies really helped draw people to the events  martin says  she estimates that between forty and fifty percent of darden students attended at least one of the week s events   the fact that companies like mckinsey  j j  bcg and goldman sachs are supporting this has been another stamp of approval   she says   these companies believe in the value of diversity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>complementing the serious tenor of many of the week s events were more social activities as well  such as the bbsf pink party on thursday night in support of breast cancer awareness  this event  which took place at a popular mexican restaurant in downtown charlottesville  was co sponsored by multiple affinity groups  including the adam smith society  darden capital management  the general management   operations club and the marketing club </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dsa also coordinated with darden s office of admissions  which each year hosts a series of  darden days  for prospective applicants  many of which target specific groups of applicants  such as members of the military or women   admissions worked with us so that the darden days focused on diversity fell during diversity week   martin says  in this way  prospective applicants considering darden got a first hand glimpse of the ways in which the community is coming together around issues of diversity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>goal to host a diversity event each month in addition to coordinating diversity week  martin has also set a goal of planning at least one diversity event every month  in september  dsa hosted a black lives matter panel  october brought diversity week  and a diversity theater is scheduled for november  she s also working on a future panel that will address issues of religious diversity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she has also worked to involve not only full time mba students  but participants in darden s executive and global mba programs  an emba student sat in on the black lives panel  and the event was streamed for students not on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by planning events each month rather than holding events in reactions to issues that arise martin hopes to allow for better discussion and greater curiosity   i think we will get better results when we offer events as an opportunity to learn from each other rather something happening in the news and diversity suddenly getting thrown in people s face   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martin s successor as dsa vp of diversity will inherit responsibility for continuing diversity week  and she hopes to leave him or her positioned to expand on this year s efforts   we re only here for two years  you re only on leadership for one and there are so many moving parts involved in planning an event like this   she says   this is the first time we have done this  but i will leave guidelines for whoever follows me  so it won t be reinventing the wheel  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>watch an interview about diversity week and diversity at darden featuring dsa vice president of diversity patricia martin and darden associate director of diversity recruiting karen ohen </paragraph>

  <title>oxford said hosts lively debate on corporate responsibility</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of its annual mba launch program  oxford university s said business school recently hosted a debate between faculty members that addressed whether corporations are responsible for practicing social responsibility as part of their business models </paragraph>
    <paragraph>oxford alumni accompanied debaters oren sussman  reader in finance  and richard barker  professor of accounting  in the discussion  sussman s assertion was that corporations should use their resources to focus on making money rather than filter them into working toward change in areas such as the climate crisis and social inequality  barker s team held the opposing opinion that while corporations should obviously function for profit  responsibility toward such societal issues can and should be integrated into their practices to achieve a greater goal </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>barker used the examples of big tobacco  the soft drink and fast food industries  and the over consumption of fossil fuels to assert that when corporations fail to recognize interests other than profit  the consequences are destructive  this team noted that innovation in a changing world is vital to the success of any business  and that consciousness of issues affecting the planet only benefit the health of a corporation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> do you invest in staff and train them in new technologies  or do you innovate out of the problem     do  you falsify papers  or cut corners  or do you slip stuff out of the pipe into the river   quizzed oxford said alumna leo johnson  a specialist in sustainability and climate change  as part of the debate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the debate ended with a student vote  in which a large majority agreed that corporations are responsible for taking part in global sustainability </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba launch initiated new students to lifetime membership in the oxford union  the university s debate society  founded in      </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  mba data guru analyzes interview acceptance rates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this week  we ve had the pleasure of connecting with wayne atwell  a second year mba student at nyu stern school of business  who is perhaps better known as the mba data guru  in january       while in the midst of applying to business school himself  he launched a website with that name after crunching numbers to figure out his own chances of getting into the various schools where he had applied   atwell is pictured above  far right  with his stern block and their strategy professor  sonia marciano  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in using data to answer his own questions about the mba application process  he realized he was also answering the questions of other mba applicants  and so www mbadataguru com was born  as for why and how he s kept updating it  even now amid the hectic pace of a full time mba program   mainly i like playing around with data   he says   i find it fun   but he s also gotten to chat with lots of mba applicants  learned a bit about web development and managed to grow an audience  he adds   still  it s more of a hobby than anything else  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fortunately for those who ve come to value his analysis of all things mba admissions  we have good news  it s a hobby he plans to continue even after he lands a consulting job post mba   he s currently interviewing with bcg  mckinsey and a few other firms   so you can expect to see more posts like the following as atwell s time permits  read on to learn what data has shown him about the relationship between getting invited to interview and gaining acceptance at a range of leading mba programs  and be sure to visit his site for more fascinating data driven analyses of the mba admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  www mbadataguru com  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba interview acceptance rate by rank</paragraph>
    <paragraph>so you have just been invited to interview at the mba school of your dreams  obviously this raises your chance of getting in  but by how much  in general  top ten schools have lower mba interview acceptance rates while schools ranked    to    have a higher acceptance rate for applicants who were interviewed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the acceptance rate ranges from     to     for schools in the top     the average mba interview acceptance rate for the top    is     and it is     for schools ranked    to    </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>nyu jumps out as the highest acceptance rate by a wide margin  if you have been selected to interview at stern then you can prepare to open a bottle of champagne because you are probably going to business school  no other school in the top    has an interview acceptance rate above     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the other end of the spectrum is kellogg and tuck with the lowest acceptance rates  these two schools will allow anyone who visits campus to interview  so it is not surprising that they admit significantly fewer applicants who are interviewed  most of the top    schools have an acceptance rate clustered between     and     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>duke has the lowest acceptance rate for a school not in the top    at      the rest of the schools range from     to     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck and don t forget to prepare for your mba interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  the data used to create the analysis on www mbadataguru com comes from gmat club  the data only represents a small percentage of the total applicants  roughly      and may be biased based on the source  therefore  results may not be      accurate and are meant to give you a rough idea of your chance of admission </paragraph>

  <title>hbs soars to top of bloomberg businessweek s new mba rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>when duke s fuqua school of business topped bloomberg businessweek s mba rankings last year  the magazine came under fire for a methodology that many claimed was flawed  this year  an overhauled methodology has yielded vastly different results  including harvard business school s taking the no    spot for the first time in the    year history of the rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our annual ranking of full time mba programs now focuses on what most people hope to get after business school  a satisfying  well paying job   read the commentary that accompanied the rankings  using a deeper and broader set of data than ever before drawn from        current students         alumni and       recruiters from     different mba programs bloomberg bw s rankings are now the combination of five weighted measurements  an employer survey  accounting for    percent of the total score   an alumni survey drawing feedback from the classes of            and          percent   a student survey of members of the class of          percent   the school s job placement rate     percent  and average starting salary     percent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when evaluated in this revised way  the new mba rankings reveal findings more in line with u s  news and world report  considered by many mba admissions consultants to be among the most accurate of the multiple rankings that crowd the field  the usual suspects rise to the top in large part  although there are some major exceptions like stanford only appearing on the list at no     dartmouth s tuck school not making it into the top     it ranked   th   and nyu stern plummeting to   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the top    schools according to bloomberg bw s new rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   harvard business school    university of chicago booth school of business    kellogg s northwestern school of management    mit sloan school of management    university of pennsylvania s wharton school    columbia business school    stanford graduate school of business    duke university s fuqua school of business    uc berkeley s haas school of business    university of michigan s ross school of business</paragraph>
    <paragraph>not only did hbs and fuqua swap spots  the first jumping seven spots to no    and the second plummeting from first to eighth   no school in the top    held the same rank this year as it did last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the strength of the programs at any of the individual schools didn t shift so dramatically from one year to the next instead it s the change in methodology that accounts for the vast variation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> with a sharper focus on what people most hope to get after business school  we think we ve created the most effective ranking yet for helping career oriented students choose an mba program   read the bloomberg bw commentary </paragraph>
    <paragraph>reflecting its self professed aim of better measuring what people hope to get out of business school  the new ranking does offer a slick interactive element allowing readers to type in a school name to reveal adjusted charts reflecting pay growth  percent of students heading to startups  the percentage of graduates entering various industry sectors  where new grads end up in terms of u s  region  average mba debt and job placement three months post mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg bw acknowledges that its new rankings methodology means that a school can rank highly overall even as it falls farther down the list in terms of the individual elements measured  hbs  for example  took the no    spot despite the fact that it ranked   th for job placement  no    chicago booth ranked second in terms of job placement  but only   th in terms of what its alumni had to say about their experience  a crazy looking chart helps showcase these variations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg bw also features a separate ranking of international mba program  topped again by western university s ivey business school in canada this year  as it was last year  the magazine s ranking of part time mba programs places northwestern s kellogg school at the top of the list </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you can view the entire      bloomberg businessweek mba rankings here  as always  those of us here at clear admit urge prospective applicants to use rankings as just one of many factors when evaluating which business school will best suit your individual needs and goals </paragraph>

  <title>applicant reports via livewire shed light on hbs  chicago booth interview invitations</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit s mba livewire has been ablaze with submissions over the past two weeks  prompting us to perform a little data analysis  though we ve been hearing from people who ve applied to a range of schools  the greatest concentration of reports have involved harvard business school  hbs  and the university of chicago booth s school of business  each of which has been busy both issuing invitations to interview and  releasing  candidates from consideration </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what did we find when we charted the results  let s take a look at hbs first </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those who were invited to interview  reported gpas ranged from     to      with an average of      the gmat score range was from     to      with an average score of      notably  the ranges and averages were much the same for those who got a ding   the gpa range was      to      with an average of       and the gmat score range was     to      with an average of       roughly one third of those who reported their hbs fates via livewire shared that they had been invited to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what conclusions can be drawn from this data  basically  the story is that everyone has great stats  so it is more than simply a stellar gpa or gmat score that gets someone an interview invitation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  we should note that our sample size is relatively small and likely subject to some response bias  which is to say that applicants who scored well on the gmat or had strong gpas may be more inclined to share their numbers publically  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>a look at data for chicago booth reveals similar patterns  here  reported gpas for applicants who have received an invitation to interview ranged from     to       with an average of      gmat scores  meanwhile  fell between     and      with an average score of      for those who got dinged  gpas ranged from      to      averaging       and gmat scores ranged from     to      with an average of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with chicago booth data  as with the data regarding hbs applicants  the sample size was small and selection bias may also be at play  interestingly  though  with chicago booth  reports of interview invitations made to livewire far outnumbered reports of rejections  with almost    percent of respondents sharing that they are now prepping for an interview  this likely has to do with the fact that chicago booth historically has interviewed between    and    percent of applicants  compared to the    percent that hbs generally opts to meet in person </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here s hoping the interview goes well for all who received an invitation  don t forget clear admit s interviews guides for hbs and chicago booth  which can help you prepare  thanks for sharing your results via clear admit s livewire  keep  em coming </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  duke   fuqua alum on how team fuqua is central to duke culture</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>happy friday  we re back again this week with another edition of fridays from the frontlines  this week we bring you steven ma  duke   fuqua alum  class of        prior to fuqua  steven graduated from oregon state university with a degree in biology   not your traditional mba applicant  when steven made the leap into the mba world  he found that the resources just weren t there for him  his blog  from bench to board  aims to chronicle his experiences and learnings with the aim of helping those who are interested in earning an mba without the traditional mba applicant background </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we welcome the contributions of other current mba students and applicants  as well as alumni  please email jeanette or marianne if you would like to add your voice to the mix  many thanks to jeremy for his great post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post was contributed for publication on clear admit by steven ma  author of from bench to board  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a duke mba alum   this is a new title that is going to take some time getting used to </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i m happy to be finally back in the workforce and it s been interesting seeing how the duke mba has changed my approach to things  with the mba application season starting up soon   fuqua s early admission round interviews should be starting   i wanted to get back to blogging and supporting the mba applicant community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the mba application season has heated up again  i ve been getting more and more requests for informational interviews on the duke mba  one question i get a lot is   what is duke looking for in an applicant  i figured this would be a topic worth dedicating some time to and help prospective students understand what business leadership means at fuqua </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the bottom line is this   any top mba program is looking for the same basic things in an applicant  these are the following  solid work experience  leadership potential  ability to work in teams  having a good job outlook  etc  however  there are nuances to this and fuqua does have a slightly different approach </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rather than compare fuqua to other programs directly  which is impossible to do anyway   i thought i d share what leadership at the duke mba means to me and provide some insight on what fuqua looks for in applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i ve divided this new series  how the duke mba makes leaders  in multiple posts  as i ve done before for other series </paragraph>
    <paragraph>almost everyone puts collaboration on their resume or cover letters  but it s much easier said than done  gone are the days of a winning at all costs or a top down mentality in business  and the most successful leaders i ve engaged with are able to collaborate with others and create a culture of collaboration in their teams  this is particularly important as new mbas and even senior leaders need to motivate their colleagues without necessarily having influence over them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but what is collaboration and what does it mean within the context of the duke mba  at fuqua  we are taught to work collectively toward a common vision and to actively look for win win situations  there is a pervasive sense that only if the team wins  i e  the program and your classmates  then it s counted as a true success  this is true for both classroom work and extracurricular activities  it s not enough to just complete a class project or land a job after school   but ensuring that your classmates also grow and have the support they need to be successful </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is not something i m only saying because it sounds good  starting from orientation  students are institutionalized into the team fuqua culture  in our diverse c lead teams in the first year  we learn how to effectively collaborate with diverse teammates hands on  there are also a lot of extracurricular activities that require working well with classmates and faculty   from club events to initiatives that aim to make the mba experience better for future classes  i strongly believe that fuqua s student led spirit and its culture of collaboration gives it a competitive advantage in the mba  marketplace  as we can be nimble and adapt the program to suit the changing mba employment environment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for example  i got involved with two new student clubs that were formed by students my year who wanted to make fuqua a better place  as part of c lead    for rising second years   i also observed the participation of my classmates and the dedication of the faculty on developing initiatives to improve the mba experience  during recruiting season  i participated in self formed health care recruiting teams where we offered each other company specific intel and interview practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you ever took game theory  you can see that collaboration creates the win win scenario in the prisoner s dilemma  however  balancing your own desire for individual success and navigating the political environment is never easy  what i realized is that collaboration is easier at fuqua because the culture supports it  when you leave fuqua  it s up to you to take what you ve learned and create a collaborative environment around you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the duke mba is a safe environment for students to develop into collaborative leaders  i ve come to appreciate all the internal obstacles i needed to overcome at fuqua when collaborating with my classmates   now realizing that it was all practice for my future roles after school  during recruiting season  i remember that i was juggling many different important projects  from recruiting to trying to get a biotech start up off the ground  but i also had to dedicate a considerable amount of energy in supporting my classmates  also consider how diverse our teams are  i e  language and cultural barriers  and you ll see that it can be a stressful environment  you know what  though  the business world is just as diverse </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking back  i definitely felt pushed both physically and mentally during those times  but the most important thing was that i learned how to collaborate even when it was hard to do so  it took a lot of effort to slow the team discussion down so everyone was aligned  or setting aside the bandwidth so i could properly interview candidates for the class of      as a second year admissions fellow  but it has all paid off  now finally an alum  i realize how the duke mba has prepared me to collaborate in the real world   through practice   every day for two years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if learning to become a collaborative leader is something that genuinely resonates with you  then i would highly recommend the duke mba  understanding why collaboration is important and demonstrating that you possess a collaborative mindset is something that is high on the list of what fuqua seeks in its applicants </paragraph>

  <title>chicago booth maintains no    spot in economist s ranking of full time mba programs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the university of chicago booth school of business snagged the number one spot for the fourth year running in the economist s ranking of full time mba programs  the which mba        released today  using a methodology that gives great weight to student and alumni experiences  the economist each year generates a list of the top     full time international mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>booth s strong performance in the overall rankings can be attributed chiefly to its ability to provide new career opportunities to its graduates  the school ranked tops out of all     schools both for the diversity of its recruiters and in terms of its students  assessment of career services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>coming in at number two this year was the university of virginia s darden school of business up one position from last year to yield the school s best ever showing in the which mba  ranking  darden bested all other schools in the specialty ranking for  personal development and education experience  and also had a strong showing  no     for  student rating of faculty  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden s strong performance in the which mba rankings was a welcome though not shocking development for newly minted darden dean scott beardsley  who assumed his post just a few months ago   a depth of learning happens at darden that does not happen anywhere else   beardsley said in a statement announcing the school s advancement in the rankings   it s intensive  it s inspiring  it s life changing  there really is no better place to realize your full potential as a leader and to advance your career   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dartmouth s tuck school of business flip flopped with darden in the which mba  list this year  slipping from no    last year to no     tuck got strong marks for the diversity of its recruiters and its  student rating of alumni effectiveness  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  elbowed its way into the top five snagging the no    spot this year  up from no    in       it s most highly ranked specialty areas were the diversity of its recruiters and the post mba salary its graduates report  france s hec paris rounded out this year s top five  slipping slightly from its  th place ranking last year  its strongest showings were in terms of increase in salary and potential to network </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and stanford graduate school of business  which often cluster at the top of other rankings  did not perform as well in the economist s line up  wharton took   th and stanford gsb came in at no     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a new twist this year  the economist introduced a  compare schools  tool that enables readers to select up to four schools and compare them side to side across a range of fields  as in years past  the economist employs a complicated methodology based on two surveys and a system of weighted averages to arrive at its rankings  the first survey is a quantitative survey completed by the schools themselves on matters such as graduates  salaries  average gmat scores and number of registered alumni  accounting for roughly    percent of the ranking  the second survey  accounting for    percent of the ranking  is qualitative in nature and completed by a school s current mba students and recent alumni  assessing things such as the quality of faculty  facilities and career services departments  the response rate to this survey must be at least    percent of the latest intake or    students alumni  whichever is lower  for a school to be included in the rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>responses to these two surveys help the economist rank schools according to four main factors  which are also weighted  opening new career opportunities     percent   personal development educational experience     percent   increase to salary     percent  and potential to network     percent   finally  the economist builds memory into the rankings by taking a weighted average of the three prior years  data         and    percent respectively  this is done  according to the economist s published description of its methodology last year   to provide a rounded picture of the school  sudden movements in data  which might not produce an immediate increase in quality  are thus reflected gradually  much as the improvement would affect students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  those of us here at clear admit encourage prospective applicants to use rankings as just one of many criteria in determining which mba program may be the best fit for your individual background  needs and goals </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>every wednesday  we share a round up of the latest news from admissions blogs at the top business schools  in this week s edition of mba admissions mashup  we take a look at students  summer overseas experiences  how top business schools are celebrating diversity and emphasizing social impact  in addition to our usual sourcing of advice and tips from various adcom teams </paragraph>
    <paragraph>uc berkeley   haas executive mba students spent a valuable week in rio de janeiro  brazil as part of an  immersion week focused on entrepreneurship  multi national corporations  and sports marketing especially timely in a country focused on preparing to host the      summer olympics   not only did the students get to experience a vibrant culture while gaining valuable business experience  they formed stronger bonds with their cohort    ultimately  what i learned most was a further reinforcement to my greatest takeaway in the berkeley mba for executives program that it is all about people and nurturing lifelong relationships  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>guest student blogger  avi sethi t     shared his experiences during his summer internship in monsoon season  sweat  and a trip around the world  my summer internship  through the monsoon humidity and the crowded commutes  avi was able to reflect on the importance of diverse experiences and how his first year at tuck prepared him for the challenges ahead   when i was recruiting for internships my first year  i wanted to find something unique  something that would stretch me in a way i had never been before  i guess this was the appropriate result i was drawn to zaya because of the challenges existing in the education venture capital space as well as the opportunity to go abroad as part of my summer away from tuck  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for guest blogger  ross bloomer  coming from southern california  fuqua s emphasis on diversity and inclusion was a welcome surprise and attending the duke mba lgbt weekend sealed the deal   now that i m currently enrolled  i can only confirm and expand upon how fantastic fuqua is for lgbt students  fuquapride has given me an immediate group of best friends and even second year student mentors as i jump into a new world of classes and recruitment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcdonough second year  jonah trout  raves about georgetown s lgbt onboarding being a factor in his comfort at one of the top business schools  upon being admitted to the program   i was paired with an out  gay second year student mentor who was invaluable to me throughout my onboarding process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and  in harvard s lgbt spotlight  alterrell mills explains that  as a member of the black and lgbt community  i know the importance of belonging to a community that provides a support system and empowers its members to play an active role in the broader community  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this week at lbs  community took on a different  but just as important meaning as the student association launched lbs for london  the initiative provides the opportunity for over     students  staff  and faculty to give back to the greater london community  victoria hanau wrote that  it was to connect with london and the local community   students helped clean two areas of the garden to help prepare the area for new vegetation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as many programs are issuing interview invites and already sending out admissions decisions  oxford on friday   mit sloan s mba admissions committee went into what happens after clicking submit on your application   we will begin sending out interview invitations in mid october and continue until the week of november  th  at which point each applicant will receive an updated status   while mit sloan values the interview and no applicant gets admitted without one  where one conducts the interview has no bearing on one s application  especially considering budgetary and time constraints   for those who can make it  we host a special program for on campus interviewees  including lunch with current students and a class visit  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for interviews  which  by the way  are being added to livewire as we speak   tuck s adcom emphasizes the need to relax  be yourself  and know yourself  in addition to doing your homework of course    the admissions committee wants to know the real you  not who you think we want you to be  it s hard to speak convincingly about your experiences and goals when you re busy trying to get into the interviewer s head  you ll risk coming across as canned or insincere   we don t want that  now do we  head over to the clear admit interview guides to get school specific advice on the most prevalent questions posed for each school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many of you may already be getting your acceptances to some of the top schools  see columbia   soon you ll be tasked with making a choice  there s no better way to experience the program than to plan a visit  sit in on classes  and meet with current students  when s the best time  the ross admissions blog has the answer for you  while there s a big range  ross admissions director soojin kwon says   when students are on campus and classes are in session   september to november or january through february  that way  you ll get to sit in on classes and experience what students experience  we have visit options outside of those times  of course  but the best times are when students are here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that s all for this week  join us next week for the latest edition of mba admissions mashup </paragraph>

    <paragraph>hiscocks states in the article   our goal is to make sure there is a pod point wherever you park for an hour or more  this includes at home  at work and at destinations where you stop frequently </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that way  whenever you return to your car it s always fully charged  our network in the u k  continues to grow but we want to see some more coverage here and then move full throttle into europe  </paragraph>

  <title>hbs admissions director  impressed    pleased    proud  and on schedule</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>yesterday  harvard business school  hbs  managing director of admissions and financial aid dee leopold had some glowing things to say about applicants in this year s first round at hbs   all of us in dillon are impressed   she wrote in a post to her director s blog   impressed that you met such an early deadline  impressed at the variety of ways in which you  introduced yourselves   impressed that you have all worked so hard to do well   she wrote  she and her team  meanwhile  are both pleased and proud to be part of a place that applicants see as  a training ground for aspirational leadership   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these warm  almost effusive words from leopold  who is perhaps better known for her direct  no nonsense style  suggest that the hbs admissions director is indeed quite pleased with the initial responses she and her team received from the new  introduce yourself  essay prompt that debuted this admission season </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the real news in her post  of course  was about the interview invitations that her team would send out to anxious applicants eagerly awaiting them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first round of invites would go at at    noon et today  to roughly     round   applicants  she shared yesterday  another     invitations  total  will go out in subsequent batches on october  th and   th  she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we have it on good authority through posts to clear admit s livewire and elsewhere  that leopold was true to her word and that invites did indeed begin trickling out right around the lunch hour in boston </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one applicant posting on gmat club shared the entire text of the interview invite email  the message  according to that post  began as follows </paragraph>
    <paragraph> warm greetings from harvard business school  after careful consideration of your application materials  we would like to get to know you better  this is our invitation to interview  take a moment and exhale  then keep reading  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as leopold promised in her blog post yesterday  the invitation did contain detailed instructions for how to schedule an interview   the online scheduling system will go live on wednesday  october  th  at    noon  et   at which point  but no earlier   those who have received an invitation will be able to register for a specific interview slot by logging into their hbs application  interview slots will be assigned on a first come  first served basis  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the invitation also shared details about where interviews will take place   we conduct interviews on campus and all over the world  we even do some via skype   it read  regardless of where or how you choose to interview  all interviews are conducted by a member of the mba admissions board  the invitation continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t sweat it if you didn t receive your invite today didn t get an interview invitation today  all hope is not lost  again  hbs expects to issue another     invites between now and october   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph> please don t speculate about the day you receive the interview invitation   leopold stressed   it s not about you  it s about us and how we set internal deadlines for applications to be read  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all interview invitations for     candidates will go out as part of the october   th wave  leopold continued in her blog post  that means no news for this group on october  th or  th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on october   th  leopold and her team will also  release  candidates who are not moving forward in the process   we hope that by doing this early  we are enabling this group to pursue other options sooner vs  later   she wrote  another group of applicants which leopold anticipates will number around     will learn on the   th that they ve been bumped to round    where hbs will  further consider  their applications </paragraph>
    <paragraph>parting words from leopold   please don t send any additional materials or letters of support  we ve designed an evaluation process that we believe is as thorough and fair as we can make it  it s not perfect  but it certainly is a process to which we dedicate a tremendous amount of care and concern  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  did you get one of those     coveted invitations to interview today    we want to know and so do your peers  so by all means share your news on livewire  now might also be a good time to check out the clear admit hbs interview guide  filled with first hand accounts from prior applicants who interviewed  hbs specific interview prep strategy and detailed analysis of some of the interview questions hbs has posed most often in the past </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you didn t get the good word today  stay strong and positive  we ll be rooting for you again on the  th and the   th </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  kindergarten teacher  with mba from ross  pursues lifelong tech dream</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how does a kindergarten teacher with a liberal arts degree score an internship at apple  find out in this week s edition of fridays from the frontline  jeremy schifeling  helped in part by an mba from the university of michigan s ross school  not only landed a marketing internship on apple s ios team  he went on to work at several educational tech firms and at linkedin before founding his own company designed to help others from non tech backgrounds break into the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he contacted us and generously offered to share his story  complete with data revealing that there are three times as many non tech job opportunities for mbas at internet firms  in marketing  hr  business development  etc   as there are positions for computer science  cs  majors and engineers  so if you re from a non tech background and want to know how make the shift  this post s for you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we welcome the contributions of other current mba students and applicants  as well as alumni  please email jeanette or marianne if you would like to add your voice to the mix  many thanks to jeremy for his great post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the following post was contributed for publication on clear admit by jeremy schifeling  ceo of break into tech  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i ve always been a huge nerd  while all my childhood friends were outside playing football  i was busy installing dos on my first computer  and when i should have been writing book reports  i was  instead  blogging on prodigy before blogging was even a thing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but i never thought i d get a chance to actually work on my nerdy passions  not with the scarlet letter that i wore ever since college  a liberal arts degree eek  no cs major  no tech job  i always assumed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so instead  i started my career as a kindergarten teacher  and though i d try to find outlets for my geekdom building a class website  teaching my students powerpoint i figured that was as close to the tech world as i was ever going to get </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  many years later  it was with great trepidation that i entered business school at the university of michigan s ross school  especially because on the first day  i met no fewer than seven former engineers who not only wanted the same tech jobs i did  but who were actually qualified to get them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but here s the crazy thing  fast forward exactly eight months from that first day of orientation and i was on my way to a different kind of orientation new intern training at apple  sure enough  i was lucky enough to land a plum marketing internship on the ios team  the exact same role that all those engineers coveted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and here s the crazier thing  i wasn t alone  on that same bus headed to cupertino was a former snowboard designer  a former navy submariner and a former manager at china s largest egg processing facility  and not a single computer science degree between the four of us </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how was this possible  how did we all make the transition into a world that can feel so forbidding to non techies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the secret is in the data  because if you crunch the numbers on linkedin and i have it turns out that for all of silicon valley s geekiness  three quarters of its jobs are non technical in nature </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>which just makes sense if you think about it  sure  it takes a lot of coders to make an awesome app  but it takes even more hr people to hire those coders  project managers to keep them organized and marketers to bring their work out to the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and the result is that there are tens of thousands of liberal arts folks working in tech just like me </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>so if you re also a nerd or like me  a nerd in hiding know this  the tech world is wide open for business  just don t be afraid to knock on its door </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jeremy schifeling is the founder and ceo of break into tech  a resource site for anyone who wants to land a great tech job no matter their background </paragraph>

  <title>understanding the mba admissions interview  part ii</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this is the second in a three part series on the mba admissions interview  in case you missed it  view part i here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>okay now that you re clear on open interviews and interviews by invitation  let s get into some of the finer points  what s this about blind versus non blind interviews  you ask  some schools believe strongly in the notion of blind interviews  which means that your interviewer will know nothing about you in advance of the interview other than what appears on the resume you give them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools that fall firmly into this camp include yale school of management  som   columbia business school and the university of chicago booth school of business  we should note that at uva s darden school  the mba admissions interview is truly blind  meaning the interviewer will not have read or reviewed either your application or your resume   it is our policy to conduct blind interviews  so there is no need to send or bring in your resume for the interview   reads the darden website  in general  though  most business schools who conduct blind interviews intend that to mean that the interviewer has access to a resume and nothing more </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we use blind interviews that is  based on the resume only  with the interviewer not seeing any other part of the candidate s application to allow the interviewer to give us as independent an assessment of the candidate as possible  without being influenced by the academic record  gmat score  essay  etc    says yale som s bruce delmonico  who leads admission for the new haven school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>blind interviews offer applicants both advantages and disadvantages  admissions experts say   i ve always liked blind interviews because the applicant gets a bit of clean slate   says graham richmond  who co founded clear admit before launching his own consulting firm advising leading business school admissions teams  there s no bias that might come with the interviewer having seen grades  scores  recommendation letters or the like  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that said  this doesn t mean a blind interview gives candidates open license to reinvent their candidacy   richmond cautions   the interview should be consistent with the written application that is ultimately submitted  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>from the school s perspective  blind interviews also make it feasible to draw from a larger group of interviewers including alumni and second year students  a blind interview doesn t require that these interviewers be fully versed in a candidate s full application or be trained to limit biases that could result from having this fuller view before the interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alex brown  who worked in admissions at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school for many years  views blind interviews as  additive  in that they represent an additional data point like essays or recommendation letters  non blind interviews  in contrast  brown views as  iterative    these give the adcom the opportunity to dive deeper into the applicant   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gsb conducts some blind  some non blind interviews at stanford graduate school of business  gsb   whether your interview will be blind or non blind depends on who does the interviewing   the only information about you that your alumni interviewer will have is your resume  which you will send directly to him her   writes stanford gsb assistant dean for mba admissions derrick bolton on the school website   we will not provide your alumni interviewer with your application  nor will we use your application to identify specific areas for your alumni interviewer to probe   he continues  adding that stanford believes the bias that could result from such guidance to alumni could outweigh potential benefit from an evaluation standpoint </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gives its alumni interviewers a structure and topics to address with applicants  although it trusts the interviewers  judgment in terms of pursuing topics more deeply that might be of particular relevance for an individual applicant  bolton continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but some interviews at stanford gsb are conducted by members of the admissions staff  in which case the interviewer will have reviewed a candidate s complete application before the interview  according to bolton   as such  he or she may conduct an interview that reflects this knowledge of your application   bolton writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>richmond notes that the  clean slate  provided by the blind interview format can actually pose a challenge for some applicants   a blind interview requires applicants to start from scratch  which is often a difficult task if you ve just poured your heart and soul into a lengthy application   he says  the non blind format can also allow for a more productive  meaty  conversation to some extent  he adds </paragraph>

  <title>understanding the mba admissions interview  part i</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with harvard business school  hbs  slated to issue its first batch of invitations today  the mba admissions world is buzzing about one thing  interviews  hbs  of course  is not alone  at dartmouth s tuck school of business  which features applicant initiated interviews  hopeful candidates have been traipsing back and forth to hanover already for several weeks  and columbia business school  cbs  has also already been busy interviewing applicants for its early decision round </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with so much interview anxiety in the air and knowing that it only stands to build from here we ve decided to devote this week at clear admit to all things interview  we re getting the ball rolling with this multi part series  which we like to think of as an mba admissions interview primer of sorts  in it  we ll unpack the different types of interviews open  invited  blind  non blind   resume based  behavioral based  team based  etc  and take a look at why particular schools choose the interview variations they do  along the way  we ll offer some tips for how best to prepare for each and explore a few of the more interesting wrinkles in the world of mba interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when all is said and done  you still may not feel fully ready to ace that hbs interview  but you ll have a much firmer grasp on the mba interview landscape as a whole  which we hope will better prepare you for interviews at all of your target schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>open interviews versus invited interviews we mentioned in the intro that tuck has something called applicant initiated interviews  also known as open interviews  they are what they sound like  at tuck and a handful of other schools kellogg s northwestern school of management  emory s goizuieta school  duke s fuqua school and unc s kenan flagler business school  for example applicants do indeed get to choose to interview  there s no need to wait or stress over receiving an interview invitation  just schedule a date  pack your bags and go </paragraph>
    <paragraph> at tuck every applicant has the opportunity to visit campus  not only for an interview but to sit in on a class with a current student  attend an information session with an admissions officer  take a student led tour and have lunch with current students   says tuck admissions director dawna clarke   we want to make tuck accessible to all applicants who are interested in seeing it firsthand  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other schools  of course  also make their campuses  classrooms and students accessible to prospective applicants who want a firsthand glimpse  but far fewer schools offer the opportunity to interview to any prospective applicant who so chooses </paragraph>
    <paragraph> ultimately we have the open interview policy at tuck to meet as many prospective students as we can   clarke says   we do this because it is difficult to make judgements strictly based on a written application   after all  what if an absolutely phenomenal applicant for one reason or another just didn t fully come to life on paper  without an open interview policy  that applicant would quite likely end up in the deny pile </paragraph>
    <paragraph> to have that personal interaction is very valuable to us   clarke says   and while it is not required  we want to provide the opportunity to everyone who applies  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the opportunity to initiate your own interview at tuck  goizueta  fuqua or kenan flagler only lasts until the open interview period ends at a given school or capacity is met  each school then switches to invitation only interviews  in which selected candidates are invited to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at kellogg  offering interviews to any applicant who wants one has been a longstanding philosophy  says beth tidmarsh  director of admissions for full time mba programs   we really want to evaluate the whole person  and the application process is holistic  we still seek to interview everyone who applies as many as we can   she says  acknowledging that not all candidates can travel to evanston for on campus interviews  tidmarsh adds that her team also uses alumni interviewers around the world   we will match candidates in their home locations to conduct interviews with alumni  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it is interesting to note that kellogg s open invitation offer is only for those who do apply  the other schools mentioned in fact allow anyone to interview  even before submitting an application  the latter policy allows schools to potentially cast an even wider net in the applicant pool  although it is obviously more resource intensive  especially given that some of those who interview may ultimately not decide to apply </paragraph>

  <title>fridays from the frontline  mit sloan mba student  veteran discusses humility and success</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s friday  and once again we re bringing you insights straight from current mba applicants and students as part of our fridays from the frontline column  our contributor this week  mit sloan school of management second year brian kirk  pictured above  second from left   knows his fair share about the frontline  both figurative and real  having served as a u s  navy submariner prior to business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the post that follows  he offers some incredible insights about humility and its impact on success  drawn both from his time at sloan and his military service  worth the read  kirk and other leaders of the mit sloan veterans association just hosted veteran s ambassadors day  a day of programming and activities for prospective mba applicants from the armed forces  they are planning a second ambassadors day in the spring  so if you are an active duty service person or veteran considering business school  check it out  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  we welcome the contributions of other current mba students and applicants  as well as alumni  please email jeanette or marianne if you would like to add your voice to the mix  many thanks to brian kirk for this week s inspiring post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from mit sloan s mba student blogs page  which features contributions from its full time mba students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> humility leads to clarity  humility leads to an open mind and a forgiving heart  with an open mind and forgiving heart  i see every person as a superior to me in some way  with every person as my teacher  i grow in wisdom  as i grow in wisdom  humility becomes more my guide  i begin with humility  i act with humility  i end with humility     eric greitens  author  former u s  navy seal</paragraph>
    <paragraph>after a wonderful first year at mit sloan and an interesting internship in management consulting  i am  without a doubt  ready to roll up my sleeves and dig into year two of my mba  as soon as i stepped back on campus  my heart soared  i couldn t control it  i was just excited to be back  mit sloan has become such a special place to me  one where the sky is the limit  where everyone wants to impact others and the environment in meaningful  insightful and transcendental ways  and eternal optimism is not just a mantra  but a way of life  i breathe a little easier when i m around other sloanies  i smile a little more and i sigh a little less </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i recently had the distinct privilege to be a  pilot  a structured mentor for a group of first year mba students during their mit sloan orientation  i was asked to share my insights on how to best succeed during the first semester as they learn to operate as a team and provide recommendations for how they might best flourish as individuals and a collective </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but how do you quantify the  secret sauce  that makes mit sloan so unique  what actionable advice could i offer my classmates that would help them through the semester  reflecting on my experiences as a u s  navy submariner  my summer internship and my time at sloan  i realized that  at its core  the defining characteristic of mit sloan and every other successful team that i have ever led or worked with is humility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>humility is at the core of sloan culture  when asked to describe the student body   humble  is often the first word my classmates offer  i couldn t agree more  every day in the classroom  i am surrounded by incredible young people who have all positively and irreversibly changed organizations for the better  yet there is never an air of pretentiousness or a feeling of entitlement  my peers share their stories and insights so that everyone can benefit from their experience and invite others to challenge their ideas to everyone s benefit  everybody recognizes that the most meaningful part of our mba education is learning from one another  and to do so  i believe we approach every conversation  case study and coffee chat with an unrivaled sense of humility </paragraph>

  <title>  average gmat up  percentage of women  minorities  international students down at stanford gsb</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  this week released its class of      profile  revealing the highest average gmat score     of all leading business schools  it s just a one point gain over last year for the palo alto school  but enough nonetheless to stay in front of the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  where the average this year was      the average undergraduate gpa for the incoming class at stanford gsb also was a record setter at      perhaps part of what led the admissions committee to add that component to its publicly shared profile statistics for the first time this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as it does each year  the school noted that especially given its smaller class size   even two students can  and do  create  variations in percentages in the overall profile  this year  those variations included dips in the percentage of women     percent this year  down from    percent last year   minorities     percent  down from     and international students     percent  down from     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this comes in a year when the percentage of female students at many other leading mba programs grew significantly with kellogg s northwestern school of management  dartmouth s tuck school and the university of chicago booth school of business all reporting record female enrollment </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we admit person by person  not category by category   reads stanford s website   there are no quotas or targets in the stanford admission process  and we assess each applicant based on her or his own merit  this is why we consider a class profile illustrative  rather than informative  in truth  there is no statistic that can capture an individual s potential  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there were also shifts in industry representation among the incoming class at stanford  most notably  students coming from consulting dropped to    percent of the class  down from    percent  those from financial services also dipped  to just   percent this year  down from    percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more incoming students with pe vc  tech backgrounds meanwhile  the percentage of incoming students who worked in private equity and venture capital prior to stanford grew slightly  to represent    percent of this year s class compared to    percent last year  those coming from the technology sector also increased  up two percentage points  to    percent   as did those from manufacturing    percent compared to last year s   percent   stanford noted that it adjusted some industry categories this year to better reflect students  backgrounds  giving military and real estate each its own category for the first time and merging consumer products and services with healthcare </paragraph>
    <paragraph>median work experience stayed steady at   years  as it has been for the past several incoming classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>application volume up those who gained acceptance to stanford for this year should be especially proud  since the total number of applicants reached an all time high of        that s up     percent over last year s        class size remained roughly flat      this year  compared to last year s       meaning that the most selective mba program in the world was likely even harder to get into last year than in prior years   stanford did not disclose official selectivity rates   stanford has enjoyed steady application volume growth in recent years  there were      percent more applicants this year than in       when       hopefuls hit submit </paragraph>

  <title>cambridge judge appoints first ever female director of the mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as mba students arrived on campus at cambridge university s judge school of business  cjbs  last month  a new academic director stood ready to greet them  jane davies  an expert in operations management and process excellence  was appointed in august to serve as the first ever female director of the mba program at judge  her appointment nicely coincides with the school s launch of a women s leadership initiative  wli  earlier in the year  new scholarships for females in partnership with the     club  sponsorship of a new women entrepreneur of the year award and a continued focus on gender diversity related research by faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while new to the role of academic director  davies is far from new to judge  since       she has taught operations management including the school s core course on operations and she has twice won the cjbs teaching award as the highest rated mba lecturer by students  in both      and      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>speaking to clear admit just before students were scheduled to arrive on campus last month  davies modestly downplayed how much her students seem to love her   i don t know about being loved   she says with a laugh   but i do take an interest in the students   this means getting to know them on a first name basis and understanding their backgrounds and inspirations  even across large core lecture classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my new role will give me more of an opportunity to get to know them in greater depth and across the full academic year   she says with clear excitement  as academic director  she will also be focused on ensuring the continuing high quality of the entire mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i will be working to give students the best possible program and experience they can have  making sure we are academically rigorous  making sure the program is relevant and developing the program further on the practical side to give students critical real world experience   she says  she doesn t worry about missing the role of lecturer  though  since she ll also continue to teach both her core classes and electives </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i know what it s like to switch careers  asked about any specific insights and priorities she brings as the first female director  davies says she views her contributions as regardless of gender   i previously worked in the consulting sector  i undertook an mba myself  i know what it s like to switch careers   she says  some might even call her a career pivot expert  she began as a management consultant  returned to earn her mba  worked in finance at fidelity and then obtained her doctorate and transitioned once again to academia </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this experience positions her well to help meet the needs of judge mbas     percent of whom switched jobs or industry or countries last year  and    percent of whom switched all three  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but it s her operations expertise that perhaps will serve her most in this new role  she says   i am used to getting stuff done  i focus on delivery and outcomes  i am really concentrated on the quality of service we deliver and i value and act on feedback   her operations background also means she is always looking for continuing improvement   we are always looking for how we can expand what we offer students  </paragraph>

  <title>choosing between the gre and gmat</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in its entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as you begin to explore an mba education  the question of whether to take the gre or gmat may soon arise  while the gmat has traditionally been the test that mba applicants take  more and more top graduate business programs are starting to accept the gre as well  ultimately  accepting both tests gives the schools a larger pool of applicants  allowing them to be more selective in terms of which students they accept into their programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a good first step in deciding which test or tests to take is to determine which scores your target schools accept  some schools will only accept the gmat  in which case your choice is made for you  when it comes to schools that accept either gmat or gre scores  there are several considerations you should take into account when choosing between the two  ranging from the differences between the tests themselves to the different ways admissions committees may interpret your choice of test  to help you make an informed decision  we ve provided a breakdown of the different tests  various sections and consulted with an admissions professional for some industry insights </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you feel completely lost  a good place to start is to take a both a gre and gmat practice test to see which one you prefer  both practice tests are freely available and easy to find online   gmac offers free software that includes two practice gmat tests  ets has a similar offer for the gre   while the tests measure similar knowledge and skill sets  there are significant differences between the two </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how the two tests stack up in terms of general structure  the gre consists of a    minute analytical writing section  which includes two essays that applicants have    minutes each to complete  an additional verbal reasoning section also features two    minute sections  another two sections are devoted to quantitative reasoning  each with a    minute time allotment for completion  finally  there is a     to    minute experimental section that can be either math or verbal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gmat  meanwhile  consists of one    minute analytic section with one essay  a    minute integrated reasoning section  a    minute quantitative section and a    minute verbal section </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of how the tests are administered  the gre and gmat are quite similar  both are taken on computers  and applicants have roughly three and a half hours to complete each test  the tests are also both adaptive  but in slightly different ways  for the gre  how a test taker performs on the first section of the math and verbal sections will determine the difficulty of the second section  for the gmat  questions grow continuously more difficult the more questions a test taker gets right </paragraph>
    <paragraph>where quantitative skills are concerned  both tests contain questions involving arithmetic  algebra  geometry and data analysis  pretty much anything you learned before trigonometry is fair game  that said  the ways in which these concepts are presented to test takers varies from one test to the other  the gre questions involve  number sense  looking at two figures  manipulating them and comparing their values  the gmat  in contrast  features mostly step by step word problems  some test takers will be tempted to choose between the tests based on the math section alone  since one format may be more comfortable and familiar than the other  most agree that the gre s math portion tends to be a little bit easier  so you should keep this in mind when comparing scores </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as far as the verbal section goes  the gre places a much higher emphasis on recalling vocabulary words than the gmat does  in turn  the gmat prioritizes grammar  logic and reasoning in its verbal section  both tests feature reading comprehension questions where you read a passage and answer questions about it afterwards  the gre also has text completion questions  where you choose a word to fill in the blank  as well as sentence equivalence questions  where you choose two words to fill in the blank space in a sentence so that the sentence has the same meaning no matter which word you use  the gmat  for its part  requires test takers to correct the grammar of a sentence as well as analyze the logic of an argument  this is another difference between the tests that may make one more appealing than the other to an individual test taker   students who excel at grammar may not have the best vocabulary and vice versa  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gre gives you a score based on your essay        your verbal section           and your math section            the gmat gives you a score based on your essay        an integrated reasoning subscore        a math subscore         a verbal subscore         and a total score           based on your verbal and math subscores  because the metrics vary considerably  the best way to find out the score you should be aiming for is to simply call the admissions office at the schools of your choice and ask </paragraph>

  <title>cambridge judge sees seven point jump in female mba enrollment</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>more women than ever    percent make up the newest mba class at cambridge s judge school of business  cjbs   which arrived on campus last week   while most schools have also seen an increase in the percentage of women students  this is a big jump for us  last year we were at    percent with a smaller class    wrote admissions director conrad chua on the cambridge mba admissions blog yesterday  chua attributed the growth in female mba enrollment in part to successful outreach by the school s marketing team </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the incoming class has     students  an increase over last year s      jane davies  who was appointed this year as the school s new director of the mba  called it  restrained growth  in a recent interview with clear admit  adding that the school does not want to compromise on quality at all by increasing the number of students  the faculty  too  has grown in size over the past few years  she noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with its one year mba program  there s a lot for students to accomplish at judge between enrollment and graduation  in his blog post  chua noted that recruiting started even earlier than usual this year  students  first eight days on campus included two employer events whereas in past years employers didn t come until the third week  he wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph> no one had a perfect application  chua went on to recount the words he d shared with a prior entering class  reminding this year s new students to make the most of their time at judge and brace for inevitable setbacks along the way   no one had a perfect application so ultimately  each student was sitting in lt  because the admissions committee and faculty interviewers had seen some potential in them  and taken a risk that this potential could be developed in cambridge so that they will become students and subsequently alumni who could build on the school s legacy   he wrote  recognizing their own potential its what will help students bounce back from any setbacks they encounter  he continued  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stay tuned for our exclusive interview with jane davies  judge s first ever female director of the mba  </paragraph>

  <title>how work experience helps open mba doors</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with so many factors to consider when approaching business school  some candidates may not be fully prepared to address the question of work experience  sure  gmat scores and gpas are key  but what s so important about a resume  applying to business school isn t the same as applying for a job  or is it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to katelyn stephenson  assistant dean for admissions at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  the two are more similar than we might think  that s because admission committees often assess both the quantity and quality of an applicant s work experience in some of the same ways that a post mba employer would </paragraph>
    <paragraph> along with their applications and resumes  our admissions committee will review candidates  professional goals as articulated through their written essays and personal interview   explains stephenson   we re trying to assess how focused they are professionally  what resources they may need for successful job placement post mba and what insight they can add to the classroom discussions based on their experiences  our duty is partly about crafting a diverse and competitive mba class  but it s also about setting students up for success and helping them get to where they want to go professionally  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> employers want to see focused  motivated  ambitious people   she says   they are looking for evidence of leadership potential  and work experience is one indication of that  even if candidates have the same academic credentials their professional background is one way to really differentiate themselves  additionally  depending on the industry  some employers also look to recruit candidates that already had four to six years of work experience prior to starting business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an mba seeker also may wonder how his or her unique undergraduate and professional background factors into the admissions process  especially if they don t happen to be in a business related field  stephenson assures prospective students that georgetown mcdonough  like many highly selective business schools  looks for diverse candidates with a balance of clearly defined goals and the ability to achieve them </paragraph>

  <title>mba application volume up around the globe  according to latest gmac survey</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>at the annual graduate management admission council  gmac  conference in denver this past june  the admissions directors we talked to from leading business schools were almost giddy  it was still early in the cycle  but application volume had been high and applicants had been strong making preliminary profiles for the class of      look very exciting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as students have come to campus and schools have shared their actual class of      profiles  the cause of that excitement has become clear  the average gmat score for this year s first year students at northwestern s kellogg school of management jumped from     last year to an all time high of      at wharton  the mean score for the incoming class this year is      up from last year s record setting      at harvard business school  hbs  the median gmat score rose from     last year to     this year   hbs does not publish mean gmat scores  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today  gmac  which owns and administers the gmat  released figures from its      application trends survey   revealing that the giddiness at last june s conference was warranted mba application volume was indeed up around the globe  with a majority of full time mba programs reporting an uptick in applicants  gmac consulted     graduate business programs at     universities worldwide to arrive at its findings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among full time two year mba programs     percent reported an increase in application volume this year  gmac reports  full time one year programs had a good year  too     percent saw the number of applicants increase year over year  up from just    percent that reported growth last year  compared to    years ago     percent of full time two year mba programs and    percent of full time one year mba programs report that they received more applications this year than in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is positive news and reflects a strong full time mba market   said bob alig  gmac s executive vice president for school products  in a statement   the full time mba continues to be a sought after credential because graduates consistently see a high return on their investment not only in terms of earnings  but also in job satisfaction and personal fulfillment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>female mba applications volume increases we ve definitely seen an increase in women applicants   said sara neher  admissions director of uva s darden school of business back at the gmac conference in june   everyone s talking about it   she said  referencing admission directors from other schools   i just worry that they re not real   neher said  half jokingly </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac s data bears out neher s experience  the percentage of women in mba applicant pools has increased   to   percentage points over the last five years for all but one of the program types analyzed  gmac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of full time two year mba programs     percent report more women applicants in       this was evidenced not only in the preliminary  anecdotal findings shared by neher and others in june  but also in the official news from the schools earlier this fall  kellogg triumphantly announced that women would make up    percent of its incoming class  up five percentage points over last year  wharton moved up to    percent from    last year  hbs had a two point gain over last year  to report that its incoming class is    percent women  uc berkeley s haas school  which blazed a trail last year in drawing    percent women  this year still attracted    percent and boasts more women in its overall program than ever before  tuck topped    percent women for the first time ever  darden  for its part  welcomed    percent women  a record for the school  sara neher can cast her worries aside  those women applicants appear to have been quite real </paragraph>

  <title>new podcast series distills hbs s signature case method</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we spoke with harvard business school  hbs  director dee leopold back in june  when she shared that an updated version of the inside the hbs case method video which every prospective applicant to the school is strongly encouraged to watch is in the works this year  as far as we know  it hasn t yet debuted  but in the meantime  hbs has announced the launch of a new podcast series that helps demystify the legendary pedagogy for which the school is known </paragraph>
    <paragraph>called cold call  the podcast series breaks down hbs s signature case method into twice monthly snippets that help listeners feel as if they are right there in the middle of the hbs classroom  hosted by chief marketing and communications office brian kenny  each podcast is led by an hbs professor who gives listeners back stage passes  if you will  to a case he or she has written  the podcast explores what inspired the case and why it matters in the world of management practice  added bonuses include interesting anecdotes the professor chooses to share that emerged as part of researching and then teaching the class to students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the podcast series draws its name from the way each hbs class starts with a  cold call  in which the professor picks one student  with no prior warning  to set out the facts of the case and kick off class discussion   it s a nerve wracking moment that binds hbs graduates across generations   notes the school s website  in all  harvard mbas will prepare and discuss between     and     cases during their two years at the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each episode of cold call  the podcast  will in just    to    minutes bring the lessons and research of hbs s renowned faculty straight to listeners  minus the anxiety of being called on  the series kicked of the week of september  th  just as fashion week was in full swing in new york city  not coincidentally  the inaugural case focused on fashion mogul stella mccartney and how she built a brand marrying luxury with sustainability </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cold call will feature new podcasts every two weeks  interested listeners can subscribe on itunes and itunesu or follow along on soundcloud   it should be on the playlist of prospective mba students and seasoned business practitioners alike   the school notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we know this much  dee leopold is a self professed  nut  about wanting prospective applicants to be as familiar with the hbs case method as possible before applying  seems like a smart move to spend    minutes here     minutes there familiarizing yourself with what makes hbs hbs </paragraph>

    <paragraph>given the mba is a          investment  not counting opportunity costs in lost income   at this time last year i was very curious about any specific  process  advice  and i was generally left disappointed as most of the advice i found online was the in the  feels good but useless  category   e g  find your passion  build great relationships  travel  dream  take risks  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this post has a lot of inherent personal bias as it is what worked for me  so please take these notes with healthy doses of salt  and  yes  this will be long and dense  but i hope you find it worthwhile </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as i outlined in the previous post  there are six priorities at business school  academics  career  extracurriculars  social  framily  close friends and family  and you  i ll go through what i ve learned as i ve approached these at school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make a plan i spent four hours during winter break going through every course that i d be interested in  after making the list  i tallied all feedback i d received about professors whose classes i should take  i went about creating a rough two year plan  i haven t stuck to it  but as always  the act of making a roadmap helped a lot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>understand historical bidding statistics we have a bidding system  so i spent time understanding the points spent on the course in question in the past and also looked at the average rating of the professor  with this data  i could easily spot the over valued and under valued courses  my takeaway   use data where possible and invest in understanding the system </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ask for recommendations early on  i asked most second years i met for top course recommendations  this helped a lot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>show up i think i missed just two classes through the year  that helped a lot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>be      present my natural add makes it difficult to keep focus throughout a class  so i worked out a simple forcing mechanism   sit in front  this helped ensure i didn t spend my time mucking around on my phone or laptop and also ensured i fed off the professor s energy  this worked most of the time  and that s what i was shooting for </paragraph>
    <paragraph>come prepared and participate this is part of the  be      present  idea  participation is an extension of that  now  i think i was far better prepared in my fall quarter than later quarters  after the first couple of weeks  i began getting a sense of the level of depth required and that helped me calibrate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>align on expectations if possible it is always helpful to have a conversation upfront if you feel there might be misalignment on goals and priorities  i can think of a couple of experiences when having this conversation would have helped </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t count group meetings as study time this is the same concept as work meetings   use this for discussion  agreement and decisions  don t count it as solo study time  bring value to a group meeting  very hard to do sometimes  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>no need to be the lead in every group continuing of the previous thread  if you find others taking the lead in some groups  let them  just make sure you do the same in another group </paragraph>
    <paragraph>think about whether you need the textbook i didn t use textbooks  but i know of people who did  so this might be true just be me  i found the course pack and readings to be more than sufficient </paragraph>
    <paragraph>attend review sessions only if absolutely necessary i went to very few  when i did  i often chose a video as you can skip through most parts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   hours i found that roughly    hours of study per course was sufficient to grasp the concepts and do well  this is roughly three hours per week  but for most people  you see spikes toward the end of the quarter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>summarize lectures   single best learning my strategy professor suggested we spend time after every class summarizing what we learnt  i d read about this technique earlier and never tried it  while i didn t strictly do it every class week  i made sure i did it every time i studied  this typically happened when an assignment was due   the assignment naturally required knowledge of what had been taught in the prior couple of weeks  so  instead of diving into the answers of the assignment  i d go back and make sure i summarized lectures first  this was an amazing move as it made it easier to make my notes to review before the exam  and in exams where we were only allowed a cheat sheet  it made the process of creating the cheat sheet really simple </paragraph>

  <title>yale som expands integrated core to include course on global teamwork</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how to effectively work on teams has long been an integral part of what many leading business schools teach their students  this year  yale school of management  som  is upping the ante by launching a new core curriculum course that will focus not only on teamwork but on global teamwork  called global virtual teams  the new course will feature research on what makes global teams succeed or fail  a requirement for all mba students in the class of      and beyond  the new core course is designed to help every yale som graduate develop skills to prepare them to work on projects with teams around the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>set to debut in january       global virtual teams was developed in part in response to challenges students shared upon returning from summer internships that involved working on global teams </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s an area where there is a fair amount of academic research into how better to work in those teams and how better to manage those teams   professor olav sorenson  director of the integrated mba curriculum at som  said in an article about the new course on the school website   our hope is that they will develop a set of skills for how to interact better with people who might be working from different cultures and different time zones  so when they go into real jobs they ll be able to drop right in and be productive from day one  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new course builds on two of yale som s greatest strengths  sorensen says  its integrated mba curriculum and its membership in the global network for advanced management  four som professors victoria brescoll  heidi brooks  michael kraus and amy wrzesniewsk will teach the course  which will take place on three consecutive days  students will then apply the skills they ve developed as part of a virtual team project in the operations engine course </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wrzesniewski  who helped design the course  notes that an experiential component was critical  as part of operations engine  students will team up with colleagues from hec paris and mexico s egade business school  both of which are part of the global network  working together they will work on a weeklong  real time operations management simulation called littlefield technologies </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the simulation will present students with some of the same challenges that they ll have when they are working in global teams in their jobs   wrzesniewsk said as part of the article on the yale website  managing a    hour process and learning how to work asynchronously is one such skill   one of the big problems global teams face is in how they hand off and coordinate information when you re not always working together in real time  you need to be sure the team has what it needs to execute without interruptions  questions or delays   wrzesniewsk continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to david bach  yale som s senior associate dean for executive mba and global programs  the development of the new course reflects the ways in which the global network has helped to spur innovation  the network  launched in      by yale som dean edward snyder  now counts    members schools in    countries across   continents </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there is a real sense of entrepreneurial initiative shared by the schools as we leverage the network to enhance the education of all of our mba students   bach said </paragraph>

  <title>new forte  rising star  pilot program preps undergrad women for business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>undergraduate women on    u s  campuses can now participate in a fun  free online program designed to help them prepare and compete for top jobs in business related fields  the new  rising star  pilot initiative  announced yesterday by the forte foundation  is designed to encourage young women of all majors to start exploring career options early to better position them for jobs in business fields immediately upon graduation  by extension  the new program could also help position women to apply to competitive mba programs after acquiring requisite work experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools participating in the  rising star  program include carnegie mellon university  cornell university  george washington university  indiana university  new york university  ohio state university  the university of michigan  the university of texas at austin  william   mary and yale university  forte handpicked the participating schools  most of which are in the consortium s business school membership already  with the goal of including a diversity of schools ranging from large public institutions to small private colleges   we went to familiar campuses where we have a strong support network for this pilot year  with the intention of expanding as soon as the pilot year is over   says forte executive director elissa sangster </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the women we have talked to post college were often behind in terms of their career plans and ambition and preparedness   says sangster   we have found that they felt pressure and were wishing they had started thinking about their careers earlier  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the  rising star  pilot was designed in response  to help women even those not in a business related field or major to explore a range of career options in business   liberal arts and engineering students often end up in business careers and mba programs  and the earlier we can start opening up doors for these women  the better   sangster says  the program expands upon the work forte has been doing for years to provide career advice and networking opportunities for post college women and women in their final college years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the web based  rising star  curriculum includes networking advice  resume building and job search support  career guidance  mba exploration and more  a total of    activities make up the program  which forte suggests the college women should allow at least two semesters to complete  along the way  participants will accrue points for successful completion of each activity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each time a student amasses     points  she earns a reward  rewards range from valuable introductions to the forte corporate and business school sponsors of the student s choosing  entry into the forte full time jobs or internships resume book  an invitation to a special networking session and application waivers for forte s c b  college to business  leadership conference or its college fast track to finance conference </paragraph>
    <paragraph>women who earn the full     points possible as part of the program will be christened a  forte rising star  a designation intended to help them stand out to potential employers  as well as to admissions committees at leading mba programs  beyond the resume enhancing title  winners will also get to choose between having a three month career prep mentor and lunching with a career influencer </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we talked a lot about gamification and what the millennial group is accustomed to   sangster says in response to how the decision to include a point and reward system came about   we wanted to make it fun  but we also wanted it to be a challenge for them and make it clear that they were working toward a goal   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the point and reward system also made it easy to  block and tackle  all of the components of the program  sangster adds   we were able to put in place something that we believe to be reasonable and achievable over the course of their time in college   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another benefit of the reward system is that it ensures that the young women are prepared to take each step along the way   not only is it fun that you get to meet with a forte corporate or business school sponsor  for example  but you will also have prepared yourself to experience that at the right level  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most exciting piece of the new pilot is gaining access to this great group of women and connecting them in turn to the forte network  sangster says  though the bulk of the curriculum is virtual providing flexibility and ease of access for women to complete it at their own pace the reward components bring the program to life and participants in contact with their peers and the larger forte program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what we are most interested in is seeing women participate in programming like the fast track to finance conference or the college to business leadership conference   sangster says  participation in these types of events will help women develop a network they would not normally have had access to that early in college </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after what sangster hopes and expects to be a successful pilot year  forte plans to expand the  rising star  program to additional college campuses  in time  to augment the virtual components  there will also be program components that take place on participating schools  campuses  she says </paragraph>

  <title>stanford dean resigns amid contentious litigation involving current  former faculty</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the dean of the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  today announced that he will resign at the end of the current academic year  just one year into his second term as dean  according to a post today in the stanford report </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i have decided that it is in the best interests of stanford and the gsb  two institutions that i love  that i step down   saloner said in an email that went out to the gsb community today  since saloner assumed his role in       the school has raised more than      million in private support  opened the new knight management center campus and adopted a new mba curriculum  among other achievements  the stanford report noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>saloner s resignation comes amid what he called a  baseless and protracted lawsuit related to a contentious divorce  between a current and former member of the gsb faculty   i have become increasingly concerned that the ongoing litigation and growing media interest will distract all of you from the important work that you are doing and unfairly impact this stellar school s deserved reputation   he wrote in his email to the gsb community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>saloner added that he planned to return to teaching and research as part of the school s faculty and was making the announcement now  at the start of stanford s academic year  to allow for a smooth transition </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is with great regret that i accept garth s resignation  which i know was a difficult decision   stanford president john l  hennessy said in a statement   it has been a very successful tenure  under his leadership  the business school has been a leader in transforming management education to address the world s economic challenges  he has expanded its international impact and he implemented an academic vision to train insightful  principled leaders who can drive global change  we are grateful to garth for his service and his many contributions as dean  and look forward to his continued contributions to teaching and research at the gsb for many years to come  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the stanford report article went on to enumerate saloner s many contributions to the school  which include launching the stanford institute for innovation in developing economies  seed  in       an initiative aimed toward employing entrepreneurship and innovation coaching to improve the lives of the poverty stricken in developing regions such as west africa  he also led the gsb      strategy process to advance several other global education programs and oversaw the school s adoption of various technical innovations in distance learning  additionally  the school has made great advances in terms of gender equity among both students and faculty with saloner as dean with women making up    percent of this year s incoming mba class and    percent of the new faculty members hired in the past two years  according to the stanford report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>against this backdrop of accolades  though  are whispers of scandal  according to accounts from poetsandquants  the litigation to which saloner referred in his email to the gsb community includes a wrongful termination suit filed by former stanford gsb professor james phills  phills  who was fired and now teaches at apple university  is in the midst of a divorce from current gsb professor deborah gruenfeld  with whom p q reports saloner was having an affair  gruenfeld  who teaches organizational behavior and co directs the executive program for women leaders at stanford  is also a board member of facebook coo sheryl sandberg s organization leanin org  started to support the advancement of women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>p q reportedly asked saloner for an interview about the charges last week  following up with a detailed list of questions to the university    saloner apparently made his decision to resign after declining a request for an interview and viewing the questions related to allegations in the lawsuit brought by phills   read a post on p q </paragraph>

  <title>does working for the family business hurt your mba potential </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>working for the family business can be an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience  building a family legacy that will last for generations is the main goal of many family businesses  and often  to achieve that goal  additional education  such as an mba  is necessary to move the company to the next level  however  it s not always easy to head into an mba program when you work for the family business and plan to continue working for the family business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>letters of recommendation  work history  application essays  and interviews can all become awkward when you suddenly mention that your experience is all connected to your family  but that shouldn t stop you from pursuing your mba  in fact  many mba applicants that come from family businesses can make their experience work to their advantage  after all  no one can be more difficult to work for than family </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we spoke with eliot ingram  ceo of clear admit  a leading source of news and information for mba applicants  to help give you a leg up on the competition  we asked him for his top pieces of advice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how would you recommend an mba candidate describe his or her experience in their family business </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the applicant needs to convince the admissions committee that they would have been just as effective at a business not run by their family   ingram says  the key to any successful mba application is the ability to sell yourself  your skills  and what you will bring to the mba program  ingram had this to say   like all applicants  an applicant working in the family business should highlight examples of their leadership and accomplishments at work  this way they can show that they are adding value to the organization  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition  you should focus on highlighting how working for the family business provided you more opportunities and challenges than you could have achieved anywhere else  after all  it s not easy working for the family business  there s a far greater degree of pressure  and the best thing you can do as an mba applicant is to focus on your areas of growth and value </paragraph>
    <paragraph>things to consider </paragraph>
    <paragraph>who should applicants ask for a letter of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even if your direct supervisor is a family member  do not ask your family member for a recommendation  although your family would probably give you a glowing recommendation  they are not the appropriate individuals to contact  unfortunately  letters of recommendation can be difficult when your parents are the ones running the company  but there are still other options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ingram recommends finding a non family member to write your recommendation letter  choose someone who knows and likes you who can and will write a good letter that focuses on your abilities  in particular  you can ask </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if your family business is completely run by family members  then it s best to ask for letters of recommendation outside of the business  you can ask a friend or mentor who successfully attended and graduated from a well known mba program  or  if you volunteer for organizations or hold a leadership position in a club or church  ask fellow leaders or supervisors in those positions for a letter of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>are there certain mba programs well suited to applicants coming from and returning to family businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>many mba programs have resources that cater to family run businesses  you re not alone in your position  the key is to find the programs that best suit your needs and desires  babson college has a family entrepreneurship  growing the family business across generations program that runs for a few days and can help you figure out the best way to promote your position within your family business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for mba programs  columbia business school  cbs   a part of columbia university  offers the j term experience  j term is a great program for applicants from family businesses who need to get their degree in just    months  in fact  this program is an excellent option for anyone who is looking to graduate with his or her mba in less time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when it comes to your application  whether you work for your family business or the corporate world  the rules are the same  always focus on your qualities of leadership and business acumen when talking about your work experience  every mba program wants to know what you bring to the table above and beyond other applicants and how you will use the mba program to better yourself and business position  if you can answer those questions  it doesn t matter if mom and dad are your bosses  you re an exceptional candidate </paragraph>

  <title>should i apply in round   or round   to my top choice school </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this is the second in a two part series on mba application strategy  in case you missed the first  check it out here </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of application strategy  one of the biggest questions prospective mba applicants wrestle with is whether to apply in round   or round   to the school they most want to attend  as you might imagine  based on our years of advising applicants to top tier business schools  clear admit has some thoughts on the matter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  if you are an outstanding candidate and have had adequate time to prepare your candidacy  then you should apply as part of the first round to your top choice school  if you are a strong candidate  but perhaps are not in the top echelon or would benefit from a little more time and experience in the application process  consider delaying your application to your top choice school until round    in the meantime  apply to a couple of other schools  that you would attend if not admitted to your top choice  in round   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the reason for this is simple   explains eliot ingram  clear admit co founder   there is a learning curve involved in the application process  and your first application is rarely your best application  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>no material difference between round   and   for some candidates as many an admissions officer will tell you  there is really no material difference in terms of admissions whether a candidate applies in round   or round    unless the candidate is from an over represented group </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you are from an over  represented group  then there are advantages to applying in round   assuming you are confident in your ability to produce a superb application early in the application process  over  represented groups are typically male candidates who are either from india or china or work within common feeder industries or organizations for the mba pipeline  consulting  banking  large corporations  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is not to suggest that admissions committees discriminate against these candidates  but they are charged with building a diversified class  which means they cannot afford to have one particular group over represented in the classroom </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you are part of one of these over represented groups  by applying in round    you will know that the admissions committee is starting from zero in terms of choosing applicants from your demographic </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for candidates who do not hail from an over  represented group  spreading applications over the first two rounds probably makes best sense from a time management standpoint </paragraph>
    <paragraph>assessing the relative advantages deciding which schools to apply to in which rounds requires careful evaluation of the relative advantages of each option  there are advantages to applying to your top school first  ingram points out   if you are admitted in round   to your first choice school  then there is often no need to submit applications in round     he says  this assumes that the round   programs in question will notify with an admissions decision before the round   application deadline  which is typically the case </paragraph>
    <paragraph> of course  getting an early acceptance to your top choice school in round   may also give you the confidence to apply to schools you hadn t considered before in round     ingram adds  in this case  applying to a top school as part of the first round may inspire you to extend your list of  reach schools  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> either way  getting an admissions decision from your top school as part of round   can reduce cost and uncertainty in the application process   ingram says  it can also simplify the decisions involved with beginning the mba program and help applicants get on track earlier for student visa  scholarship and financial aid considerations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the other hand  there are also advantages to applying to a candidate s top school later   if a candidate waits until round   to apply to her top school  then the experience of applying in round   should sharpen the application for the top school  increasing the chances of admission at the top school   ingram points out </paragraph>

  <title>how to live a good life takes center stage during kellogg orientation</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>before diving into the fray of finance  accounting  operations and marketing  every incoming first year student at northwestern s kellogg school of management first spent an afternoon grappling with the question of how to live a good life </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what do i value    how do i find my personal mission    how do i create an action plan to live a life consistent with this mission   these considerations not how to cut costs  gain market share or increase profits were part of a new element introduced this year during kellogg s complete immersion in management  cim  week  the stretch of days before classes start when incoming students meet each other and the school for the first time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>coined the  good life afternoon   this newest element of kellogg s orientation grew out of a student led initiative launched last spring called the  good life sessions   the brainchild of kellogg students rohan rajiv      kellogg  and lexie smith      kellogg   last year s series of workshops and this year s orientation exercise were both designed to help students create a game plan for leading fulfilling  balanced lives in tandem with successful careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>get this right or forget getting the other things right</paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is stuff that i believe is incredibly important and if we don t get right there is almost no point in getting all the other things right   rajiv explains  a self professed  work life balance geek   rajiv spent much of his   s thinking about and researching happiness and balance  including maintaining a personal blog called  a learning a day   where he shares his thoughts on the topic </paragraph>
    <paragraph>smith  not so much   pretty much all throughout my   s i was in some really fantastic jobs  but they were incredibly challenging and i was working really long hours    to    hours a week and traveling a lot   she says  she spent a few years after college in a financial management program at ge that involved rotating departments every six months  she went into private equity after that  the first woman ever hired by her firm   it was a really interesting experience for me  but it meant that i didn t make time for anything else  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the two met when rajiv visited kellogg for an admitted students  weekend and immediately hit it off  so much so that rajiv signed up for a kwest trip smith was leading in the galapagos islands before school started last fall  it was on that trip that the idea for the good life sessions began to take hold </paragraph>
    <paragraph>two students with similarities and differences  i loved his energy   smith recalls of meeting rajiv   i loved how balanced and settled he seemed when i talked to him   both came from low income homes and were raised by single parents  albeit in different parts of the world   rajiv grew up in india and went to school in singapore  whereas smith s childhood included stints in florida  texas  illinois  virginia and ohio as her mom did everything from loading ups trucks in the morning to waitressing at night to provide for her and her two brothers  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> he spent most of his   s studying how to have a better life   says smith  who rajiv says has become like a big sister to him   i was so attracted to that about him  and i was really craving to figure it out for myself but was still very much struggling to do so  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we came to the conclusion that i probably wasn t the only crazy person at kellogg  and maybe there were a few other people out there who would like to learn how to live a better life as well   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in consultation with kellogg clinical associate professor of innovation   entrepreneurship carter cast  mba      who led marketing at pepsico and blue nile before serving as ceo of walmart com rajiv and smith put together an outline for what the good life sessions would look like and recruited three additional faculty members to take part  clinical professor of strategy harry kraemer      adjunct lecturer of leadership coaching kevin murnane and clinical assistant professor of leadership and director of mba leadership development paul corona </paragraph>

  <title>how to make sure your job enhances your mba application</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>this post has been republished in entirety from its original source  metromba com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba candidates most often apply to business school because they are seeking more rapid career advancement  or they want to dramatically change their career path  however  for many full time mba candidates  job dissatisfaction is just as likely a reason otherwise they wouldn t be applying for an mba  but no matter the reason behind the mba  every applicant should remember that their application is a chance to sell their skills and demonstrate the value that they will add to the program  to do this  it s important to learn how to spin your work experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we reached out to julie r  barefoot  the associate dean of mba admissions at emory university s goizueta business school  for her advice on making the most out your job experience  here s what she had to say </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t reveal your job dissatisfaction</paragraph>
    <paragraph> mba applicants need to remember that admissions officers will not know that the candidate doesn t like their job unless the candidate tells them   barefoot said  more likely than not  during your interview or application essay  no school or admissions  officer is going to ask   are you happy at your job   that question is irrelevant to your mba application  your happiness in your current situation does not reveal your aptitude for the mba program  and that s what matters  in situations where you don t want to reveal certain details  remember that less is more  you are not required to tell your application committee that you have a terrible job with an incompetent boss and rude coworkers  focus on the details that would be of interest and value to your mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>focus on what your job has taught you</paragraph>
    <paragraph>no matter how difficult a situation you find yourself in at work  you should still be learning something  in fact  for many individuals learning what not to do is just as valuable as learning what to do   mba applicants should try and put a  positive spin  on their current job situation    barefoot continued   and focus on what they have learned in the job   if you currently work at a company that is disorganized and rarely achieves desired goals and benchmarks  show how you ve learned the importance of organization and follow through  if your coworkers are not team players  emphasize how harmful that was to the company and how you ve come to understand the value of teamwork to encourage creativity  idea generation and communication </paragraph>
    <paragraph>circle back to the importance of the mba program</paragraph>
    <paragraph>if after changing all your negative experiences into positive learning opportunities  you re still struggling to write an essay  bring it full circle back to the mba program  if you re truly dissatisfied with your position  barefoot recommends that you  articulate to the admissions officer how an mba will prepare you for your desired job or new career path   after all  your goal in attending an mba program is to move forward into a new path in your life  speak to the fact that an mba could provide you with the tools  information  confidence and abilities you need to successfully pursue a much more satisfying and rewarding career </paragraph>
    <paragraph>barefoot continued  saying   i would recommend that applicants focus on how their work and life experiences will be meaningful to share in the mba classroom  as well as how those capabilities  in combination with the mba degree  will make them a good fit for their desired post mba career path   when it comes straight down to it  mba programs want to know what you will bring to the program and whether  upon graduation  you will bring credibility to the program  so  if you are at a job you dislike with little opportunity for advancement  focus instead on how the mba will help you reach the next level </paragraph>
    <paragraph>find other opportunities to develop your skills</paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba programs are not solely focused on business  they are also focused on personal development  if your job does not provide you with the opportunity to develop new and desirable skills  find outside opportunities  barefoot gave us this example   if the applicant feels that they have not had the chance to demonstrate much leadership in their job  then volunteering for an organization like habitat for humanity and leading a team of volunteers would be a good idea   there are a multitude of opportunities to build your resume and improve your skill set  and many can be found outside of the office  don t underestimate the importance of having a life outside of your job  volunteer opportunities  church leadership and even hobbies can all reveal valuable insight into your mba potential </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when it comes down to it  your satisfaction or dissatisfaction with your job should not play a strong role in your mba application  no matter the position you find yourself in  there are always ways to spin your experience in a positive light  and if that seems impossible  be prepared to speak to other opportunities that demonstrate your competence and fit for your desired mba program </paragraph>

  <title>savvy mba application strategy  how many apps  which schools  when to apply</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>you ve decided the mba is the next stop on your career path  what now  the smartest applicants are those who take the time to create an informed mba application strategy a well thought out game plan that can help you obtain your goals as efficiently and effectively as possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the first challenges you ll face is school selection strategically choosing which schools to target  bearing in mind the competitive mix of those schools    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in recent years  mba applicants appear to be trending downward in terms of the total number of schools to which they apply  where applying to five to seven schools was once considered the norm  today candidates apply  on average  to between three and five  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a combination of factors could be at play here   suggests alex brown  a consultant to clear admit who spent years working in mba admissions at wharton   more information is now available about schools  so it is easier for candidates to determine which are truly target schools  rather than the more shotgun approach of yesteryear   he says   the complicated nature of the application  engaging recommenders and so forth  may also be encouraging applicants to really refine their school list before applying  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>making your list so what types of schools should make up the list a candidate ultimately applies to  while the answer will obviously depend on the individual candidate  one piece of advice applies to all   remember  only apply to schools you would be absolutely happy to attend   says brown   there is no value in applying to a school just to get an acceptance letter if it s not a school that will help you reach your goals  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with that main tenet as a guide  many candidates find it valuable to classify schools into three buckets  reach schools  realistic schools and safety schools  applying to at least one school in each of these buckets helps position a candidate to get into and ultimately attend the best possible school her candidacy will allow  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>say you apply to all safety and or realistic schools and gain admission to every school  while on the surface this appears like a successful mba application strategy  that is only true if your mix of schools included the best possible school to reach your goals   if you only apply to  realistic  schools  you will never know if you could have achieved something that you presumed was beyond your reach   brown points out  therefore  a truly successful application strategy often includes one or two rejections along with acceptances at schools where you will thrive   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the final consideration of a comprehensive mba application strategy is when to apply to your selected schools  that is  what admissions round should you target for which schools and why  more on that in an upcoming post  so stay tuned </paragraph>

  </authors>
  <title> admissions director q a  wharton s frank devecchis</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>way back in february  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school named a new director of mba admissions  aside from an immediate flurry of coverage here and elsewhere about this wharton  insider  frank devecchis stepping in  little else has been heard since  what gives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as was reported then  devecchis does know wharton intimately  he worked in the wharton mba program office for more than five years before heading over to admissions  in charge of operations and daily management of the mba program  he advised more than     students  implemented the school s innovative course match registration program and rolled out a new three week orientation for incoming students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since joining mba admissions earlier this year  he s been a hard man to get a hold of  he works closely with existing deputy vice dean of wharton mba admissions  financial aid and career services maryellen reilly lamb to oversee the entire application process  from recruitment through matriculation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> these past few months have been a blur  and the next few don t look much slower    he shared when we finally managed to catch him last week  before jetting off again to asia this week  he was kind enough to make time to answer our questions  we re glad we caught him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as you work on your wharton applications  we think you ll be glad we caught him  too  in the interview that follows  he shares some of the unique perspectives he brings to admissions from his time in the program office  his excitement about an increased focus on innovation and entrepreneurship under wharton s new dean and why his team was so happy with last year s essay that they decided to keep it exactly the same this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with wharton s round   deadline still a few weeks off september   th there s still time to catch devecchis and other members of this team at recruiting events taking place around the globe  click here for a full list of upcoming events  you can also catch a virtual mba admissions information session later today  from   to   p m   est  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what have you found most rewarding about your shift from the program office to admissions  most challenging </paragraph>
    <paragraph>frank devecchis  there is something about being there from the beginning when everything is new and everyone is in self discovery and exploration mode  in my new role  i see candidates from day one  learning about their goals  aspirations  where they want to go and what they want to become  and learning how wharton can be part of the journey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once they are admitted and become students  it is great to see our colleagues in academics  leadership  student life and career management take over and continue helping individuals grow and prepare to be extraordinary leaders  no two students or their pathways are the same  it s amazing see how all the puzzle pieces fit together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most challenging thing  jetlag  in three months i ve been to london  dubai  la  seoul  beijing  shanghai  denver and tokyo </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what unique insights do you bring to your new role as a result of other work you ve done at wharton over the years  advising students  planning orientation  implementing course match  etc   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fd  i have a deep appreciation for the uniqueness of every candidate and student  over the past few years  i have worked with students  faculty and staff to continue to develop a program that reflects and celebrates individuality and personalization  one of wharton s greatest strengths is its diverse community in professional background  experience  culture  etc  and i strive to continue this tradition  also  i can t help but see everyone as a potential student in our classroom  considering what they will bring to and get from that setting and thinking about how their personal experiences will inform their learning and enrich the academic experiences of their classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  when your new role was announced earlier this spring  your responsibilities were reported to include helping to develop strategic recruiting plans for wharton s global applicant pool  what does that look like </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fd  wharton is committed to building classes that mirror the diverse business community our students will lead  to do this  recruitment cannot follow a one size fits all model  we strive to continually innovate how we connect and develop relationships with candidates by utilizing new communications methods and strategies and technology  we bring a bit of the wharton experience to every interaction  whether in person or virtual  allowing candidates to have a first hand and personal understanding of what we have to offer </paragraph>

  <title>tuck tops forty percent women for first time ever</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>gender equity in top mba programs which seemed like a nearly impossible feat just a few short years ago is looking more and more like a wholly attainable goal  leading business school after leading business school has been proudly announcing record percentages of women in their incoming classes this past month  the latest  dartmouth s tuck school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a letter to the tuck community on tuesday  freshly minted dean matthew slaughter shared that tuck tops    percent women in its incoming class this year for the first time in the school s history  the actual figure    percent places tuck shoulder to shoulder with schools like haas  wharton  harvard  chicago booth and kellogg  all of which have    percent or more females in their incoming classes or overall mba programs this year  stanford gsb  historically among the leaders in terms of female enrollment  has yet to make public its class of      profile </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at tuck  the percentage of women jumped a whopping    percent over last year s    percent  we re checking in now to see what steps the school took to help bring about this impressive gain  and it s not the only gain the school is celebrating this year  u s  minorities also rose  from    to    percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the percentage of international students dipped slightly  slipping to    percent this year  down from    percent last year  still  those international students represent    countries from around the globe  and    of this year s students from the united states in fact are dual citizens of another country as well  slaughter pointed out  he added that    percent of the class has studied abroad     percent has worked abroad  and more than    percent speak a foreign language in some capacity   with such rich global experience even before beginning their time at tuck  it is clear that the t    class will eagerly embrace the new tuckgo program  designed to ensure that all tuck students graduate with a global mindset   he wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new required component will ensure every tuck student obtains global exposure the new tuckgo program  announced last year  is a set of immersive experiential courses that take tuck students to countries around the world  every tuck student  before graduating  must participate in at least one such course in a country that is new to them  to satisfy the tuckgo requirement  students can choose between a global insight expedition  an elective travel course led by a member of the faculty  a first year project that involves significant travel outside the u s   onsite global consulting  a second year elective in which students offer consulting to a range of worldwide clients  or an international exchange with one of tuck s partner institutions  one way or another  tuckies in the class of      should expect to see the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dean slaughter had global experience for tuckies in his sites well before he stepped into the role of dean  in       he formed the tuck center for global business and government  as part of an august      interview he said   one of the important dimensions of the current strategic review for the school is whether there should be some sort of global experience requirement   last september  when tuck announced  that precisely such a requirement would be instituted beginning this fall  slaughter said   making an immersive global experience a required part of the curriculum strengthens this commitment to ensure that every tuck student receives outstanding preparation for the global leadership that businesses are today seeking  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>academics  work experience  student age remain constant in other ways  the incoming class shares much in common with the current second year students at tuck  average gpa this year held steady at      and average gmat score actually slipped by a single point from last year s      to     this year  like last year  members of this year s incoming class come in with an average of five years  work experience  and the average age is     the range of ages of students has tightened a little  the class coming in last year ranged from    to     while this year s class members are between    and    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his address to the tuck community  slaughter thanked director of admissions dawna clarke and her team for all their hard work in assembling the incoming class  director of financial aid diane bonin and team for helping those students find a way to finance their mba and assistant dean for the mba program sally jaeger and her team for welcoming the new class with a terrific orientation week </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the      class is incredibly diverse  accomplished and poised to achieve great things both throughout their two years here and in the many years beyond   slaughter said </paragraph>

  <title>the inside scoop on the forte forums  great networking for prospective female mba applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>from atlanta to seattle and back  forte forums have been taking place around the country  giving prospective female mba applicants a terrific opportunity to connect with admissions staff from dozens of leading business schools  hear from current students and alumnae and meet fellow applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the forte forums are an annual event series put on by the forte foundation  a consortium of leading companies and business schools committed to helping launch women into fulfilling careers in business  taking place in    u s  cities as well as toronto and london  these free events kicked off on august   th and will culminate with a final event in october </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to truly understand what prospective female mba applicants can hope to gain from attending a forum  we dropped in on one ourselves late last month in boston  the cluster of professionally dressed young women in the lobby of the liberty mutual building on st  james avenue provided a preview of what we would discover upstairs  after a brief and efficient check in process  attendees were given a package of materials and welcomed into a large banquet hall  where admissions staff  current students and alumnae from leading business schools stood ready to answer their questions </paragraph>
    <paragraph> </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in all  there were close to    schools represented  attendance was so great that it was difficult to make your way down the aisles between the schools  tables  and prospective applicants sometimes had to patiently wait their turn to speak to representatives from their target schools  but wait patiently they did  and in turn they got to quiz admissions staff and current students from harvard business school  cornell s johnson school  nyu stern  columbia business school and countless other leading mba programs about curriculum  application essays  student life  financial aid and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>international schools  too  were solidly represented  among the mix  ie business school  hec paris and cambridge university s judge school  inquisitive young women with notepads in hand traveled from table to table introducing themselves and listening intently as admissions representatives detailed what to expect from the application process and how best to prepare </paragraph>

  <title>social media as a window to your soul  stanford gsb prof says yes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>so last week we shared some tips and cautionary tales from admissions directors at leading business schools about mba applicants and their social media presence  in a nutshell  we found that different admissions committees use social media to varying degrees as part of the mba admissions process  but a general rule of thumb is to not be an idiot  in fact  recent research out of the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  suggests that monitoring an applicant s social media behavior over the long run could actually reveal more intimate traits and core personality than face to face interviews  adcoms  take note </paragraph>
    <paragraph>assistant professor michal kosinski  who teaches organizational behavior at stanford gsb  was surprised to learn as part of research he conducted recently just how much what an individual  likes  on facebook can reveal about a person </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the thing that was most surprising to me   is that our most intimate traits can be very easily predicted from a digital footprint  and a very general one as well  such as facebook  likes    kosinki said as part of a recent interview with the stanford news service </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of findings that most surprised kosinski who holds a doctorate in psychology and whose research interests include big data  crowdsourcing and psychological assessment was that he was even able to predict whether someone s parents were divorced or not based on their facebook likes  in fact  those results seemed so improbable that he began to doubt his own methods and reran the analyses a few times   i couldn t believe that what you like on facebook could be affected by your parents  divorce  which could have happened many years earlier we re talking here about people who might be    or    years old   he told stanford news </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond the marital status of your parents  your digital footprint is also predictive of many other intimate traits  kosinski found  from whether you smoke  drink or take drugs to your sexual orientation and political views </paragraph>
    <paragraph> actually  everything we tried predicting was predictable to some degree  and quite often it was pretty accurate   he said in the interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>come on you know you re curious to see if this is for real  well  you re in luck  a demo of kosinski s models is available here  www applymagicsauce com </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not only were intimate traits predictable from facebook  likes   kosinski found that even broader measures related to your digital footprints can be used in predictions how many facebook friends you have  the number of your likes  how many times you log in to facebook  how often you tweet </paragraph>

  <title>haas welcomes new class with multiple week zero surprises</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>orientation week at uc berkeley s haas school of business better known as week zero was chock full of surprises for the     incoming students in the full time mba class of        for starters  while working on their very first case study on virgin america  the students got a shock when virgin america ceo david cush walked into the auditorium </paragraph>
    <paragraph>who better to learn from about the company s decision to enter the airline market  discussing the move made by virgin group founder richard branson in       cush described the decision which was based on branson s belief that airlines were poorly run and flights were too expensive  amid intense competition and despite a rocky start  the company is taking on the big airlines and adding new destination cities  he said  and has moved from the bottom quartile to the top half of airlines  students then got to quiz cush on the company s culture  how it hires  its strategy for innovation and the challenges it still faces </paragraph>
    <paragraph>additional week zero surprise guests included revolution foods co founders kristin groos richmond and kirsten saenz tobey  both      haas mba grads  tobey and richmond started their company which serves healthy meals to public school students across the united states with a network of haas supporters  among them adjunct prof  kellie mcelhaney  lecturer william rosenzweig and angel investor dick beers  who invested         after revolution foods placed first in the berkeley   haas global social venture competition   every single piece of the equation we built here at haas   richmond told the class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>investors early on told them their cost model was unsustainable  but the haas defining principle of  confidence without attitude  helped them stay the course despite doubts  richmond said  today  revolution foods has raised more than      million and served more than a million healthy meals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas dean lyons   we co own this school  second year students and program staff planned the packed schedule for week zero  which included a day focused on each of the haas defining principles  question the status quo  students always and beyond yourself and the aforementioned confidence without attitude  presentations by the mba program office  career management group and mba association were followed by an official welcome by haas dean rich lyons </paragraph>
    <paragraph> from here on out  we co own this school   he told the students  a nod to the high degree of student involvement that characterizes the haas mba program   it s this sense of co owning and leaning in to one another that makes us stronger  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond simply talking about the school s values  the week zero roster of events also helped bring them to life  activities such as game of teams and the cohort olympics focused on collaboration and community building  and this year  shifts in the programming were also implemented to better highlight and include the diverse haas student body which boasts    percent women and    percent international students  for example  the cohort olympics  which in the past has largely featured american sports and male referees  this year included cricket in place of football  led by a south african woman </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one morning was also devoted to volunteer service with students working to beautify a children s playground and gardens at the alameda point collective  a housing organization that serves homeless and at risk families </paragraph>
    <paragraph> week zero created such a strong foundation for my success during my first year   isabelle schuhmann  mba    and week zero co chair  said as part of an article on the haas website     i feel honored to have played a role in creating a strong introduction for the incoming class and helping to set them up for success  </paragraph>

  <title>social media in the mba admissions process  how careful should you be </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>while presidential candidate donald trump has shown that decorum on social media is not necessarily a prerequisite for running for the highest office in the land  admissions directors at leading mba programs suggest that prospective applicants might do well to show a little more caution when it comes to linkedin  facebook and twitter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>just what is the role of social media in the mba admissions process  you ask  we wondered that  too  to get a clearer picture  we checked in with some of our sources in the admissions offices at leading business schools  we discovered that different schools take different approaches when it comes to checking out a candidate s social media presence and protocols are still evolving </paragraph>
    <paragraph> social media definitely makes our lives much more interesting these days   says ut mccomb school of business director of mba admissions rodrigo malta  that said  the message he shares with applicants today is the same as it was when he started his job eight years ago  well before tweets and facebook statuses became such a part of the mainstream   we have always said that any touchpoint the applicant has with members of the mccombs community counts toward their application   he says  just as if you visited campus and were a jerk to a receptionist or sat in on a class and were disruptive  untoward behavior on social media will be noted in your file  he cautions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with social media being such a big part of our lives and with employers looking at it as well it makes sense for it to play a role in mba admissions  malta says   that s not to say we google every candidate to see what comes up or go looking for their facebook pages   he says  but if his team gets feedback from a current student or member of the staff that there s something on social media that warrants attention  they will take a look   we note anything we find in the same manner we would a personal interaction  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the university of virginia s darden school of business  googling every applicant is also not a part of the application protocol  but social media does sometimes factor in   if someone has a common name  it is not going to be worth our time to try to google you   darden director of admissions sara neher says matter of factly  but if an applicant is an entrepreneur  for example  neher may very likely check out her company website  and her team will certainly look at things on social media that applicants make a point of sharing in their applications </paragraph>

    <paragraph>as part of the      impact challenge  incoming ross first years will work together with close to    local high schools students  helping them develop business plans and products for the brand new brightmoor maker space a community workshop and incubator where ideas generated by teens and community residents will come to life  the ross mba students will also organize a maker faire and pitch competition for the teens </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the incoming ross first years will work hand in hand with detroit leaders and youth over the course of the week to launch the maker space  tomorrow  august   th  the ross mbas will organize the detroit youth maker faire  which is expected to draw       attendees from the community to watch the youth product pitch competition  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on hand will be expert judges from deloitte and general motors this year s impact challenge sponsors who will select winning products and award seed funding to the winning teams to help get their entrepreneurial efforts off the ground </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the week long impact challenge is just the beginning  though  in terms of the ross students  involvement with the brightmoor community  a group of mba and undergraduate students from the sanger leadership center will continue to work in partnership with the detroit youth and leaders for the next eight months  helping transform the maker space from concept to reality </paragraph>

  <title>hbs draws more women  adds six points to gmat median</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>when it released its preliminary class profile in june  harvard business school  hbs  was expecting its incoming class to be    percent female  a record for the school  in august  with students preparing to move in on campus  things look even better </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs draws more women than preliminary profile suggested dee leopold  hbs managing director of admissions and financial aid  posted the final class of      profile on her direct from the director blog today  revealing that women will in fact make up    percent of the class  a two point increase over last year  while this still trails kellogg and wharton each reported earlier this month that    percent of their incoming classes will be women it puts hbs ahead of last year s leader of the pack  uc berkeley s haas school  which this year slipped to    percent  from a high of    last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more significant than the difference in a single percentage point from other top schools is the vast improvement it represents at hbs  and the other schools   over the way things were not all that long ago  at hbs  women made up just    percent of the class in      and a mere    percent in       together with its peer rival top tier business schools  hbs is leading the charge toward gender parity among mba students  and we say bravo </paragraph>
    <paragraph>six point gain in median gmat score the median gmat score for the hbs class of      is     no change here from the preliminary profile released earlier this summer  it does represent a significant uptick from last year s      and it s exactly the same as wharton s recently announced median   the mean gmat score at wharton for the class of      was      hbs does not publish mean score data   with stanford  which has been a historical frontrunner in terms of median gmat scores  yet to share class profile information  wharton and hbs lead the pack in this regard so far this admissions season </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tucked away in the class profile that went out today was what may be another record breaking stat  hbs s yield which is to say the percentage of students who actually enroll after being admitted hit    percent  for many years the school has hovered around the       percent mark  at    percent   we believe this is the highest yield rate of any educational institution in the world   wrote hbs director of media and public relations jim aisner in an email </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs also reports that it was more selective this year than in previous years  accepting just    percent of the       who applied  compared to    percent of the class of      and    percent in each of the past two years  this can be linked to the fact that application volume has steadily increased over the same time period  from       in      to       this year  stanford  though  still holds the record when it comes to selectivity  with an admitted rate last year of around     percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is also a shift this year in what incoming hbs students studied as undergrads  although not quite as great as june s preliminary profile suggested  at the beginning of the summer  leopold and her team expected    percent of incoming students to have stem  science  technology  engineering or math  backgrounds  a significant jump over last year s    percent  when all was said and done meaning after some admitted students opted out and others got in off the wait list stem undergrads now make up    percent of the class  undergrads in the humanities and social sciences represent    percent of the class  a falloff from last year s    percent  economics and business majors continue to dominate  making up    percent of the class  up from    last year </paragraph>

  <title>percentage of female mba students at haas dips slightly  but total number of women in program reaches new high</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the haas school of business at uc berkeley last year made headlines when it enrolled a record setting    percent women in its incoming class  besting all other leading business schools and representing a    point gain over the year before  when female mba students at haas made up just    percent of the class  this year  haas saw a slight decline in women in its incoming class to    percent  but combined with the women in last year s class  the program as a whole now counts more total women than ever before  the school points out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  the full time mba program still hovers at almost    percent female  making it a frontrunner for top mba programs   school and student leaders say the class composition both reflects and builds on their push for gender equity   read a recent article on the haas website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas is certainly not alone in launching a concerted effort to raise the percentage of female mba students in its ranks  northwestern s kellogg school of management and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school each recently announced that their incoming classes this year would be    percent female  up from    and    percent last year  respectively  harvard business school is close on their heels  reporting in june as part of a preliminary profile for the incoming class that    percent will be female  holding steady from last year  stanford graduate school of business  which had    percent women in its incoming class last year  has not yet disclosed class profile information for this year s incoming class </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at haas  students have helped to spearhead a comprehensive gender equity initiative  gei   which takes a three pronged approach to increasing female enrollment from the perspectives of culture  academics and admissions  groups of students have broken off to tackle each of the three areas  conduct serious data analysis and suggest solutions that the school began implementing last year  says jo mackness  haas chief operating officer   they are very organized about it   she says  in fact  so much progress was made in such short order that the initiative had to be renamed  she points out   it was initially called   by   but handily surpassed its own target of reaching    percent women female mba students at haas by       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mackness was one of    business school leaders to convene at the white house earlier this summer to discuss how to address the gender imbalance among mba classes  there  she shared the progress haas has made toward gender equity and committed to a set of best practices designed to break down barriers to women both in business school and the business world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas also revealed as part of its class of      profile that the average gmat score slipped two points  to      but application volume was up     percent  increasing from       to        the school did not reveal an acceptance rate  but given the increase in applicant volume and little change in class size  the selectivity rate is likely close to last year s      percent </paragraph>

  <title>admissions director q a  julie barefoot of emory s goizueta business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>school s in session at emory s goizueta business school  just as students were beginning to stream onto the atlanta campus for both the full time and executive mba programs  associate dean of admissions julie barefoot made time to discuss all things goizueta with clear admit  we are so grateful to her </paragraph>
    <paragraph>barefoot has been at goizueta since       so if anyone knows the school  it s her  she herself holds an mba from unc s kenan flagler school of business  so she also knows mba admissions from both sides </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  the self professed foodie dishes on the atlanta restaurant scene  exciting developments in the school s management practice initiative  the opportunities available to students interested in social impact and much more  she also goes into amazing detail about the admissions process  including giving advice on how to tackle the essay questions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if goizueta is one of your target schools  this is a must read </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what change  event or development are you excited about most in the year ahead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>julie barefoot  there are a few  the first is that we hired an alumna who had been with accenture for many years lynne segall to lead our management practice effort  until recently it was led by a beloved faculty member who retired  it s great to have an alumna who has been working in a top consulting firm take the role  she will be adding a lot more resources into the experiential practice we have and will be continuing to expand it across all of our programs  it began in our full time mba program  but now all of our students will have an opportunity to work with real clients and real world problems </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lynne is adding an even deeper framework how to tackle problem solving  her approach to the semester as she teaches the course is asking students to really think about  how do you dissect a problem  how do you know which of the analytical tools you will learn here in business school to employ to address a particular business problem   she is a perfect fit for this job she is so excited about it and she has been onboard all summer gearing up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i am also excited that we are continuing to develop our entrepreneurship offerings  we will be offering a new entrepreneurship practicum course  which will give students an opportunity to work with someone in the atlanta tech village  there will be an office there where they can collaborate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and our social enterprise   goizueta program continues to evolve  here again students have another great experiential learning opportunity  one example is farmers to    a social enterprise that encourages sustainable economic development within the coffee growing communities of nicaragua  our students have helped these farmers develop a direct trade model that produces excellent coffee for consumers while returning    percent of the profit to the farmers who grow the beans  this is yet another initiative that is available to our students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>marketing analytics is a whole other area we are developing  i could go on and on </paragraph>

    <paragraph>notably  wharton did set a record itself in       when women made up      percent of its entering class  but the school then backslid a little  to    percent in      and    percent last year  it s nice to see the philadelphia school regain some ground </paragraph>

  <title>high touch outreach by current students helps boost kellogg s female enrollment</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the kellogg school of management at northwestern university is very excited about its incoming class and with good reason  a record    percent of the class of      is female a five point surge over last year making kellogg a frontrunner in a national race to increase female enrollment at business schools  indeed  kellogg s class profile was released just a day before the council of economic advisers and the council on women and girls convened representatives from dozens of leading business schools at the white house to commit to a set of best practices developed to expand opportunities for women in business school and beyond </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but kellogg s female enrollment wasn t the only statistic to surge with its newest class  kellogg s average gmat score also jumped  from     last year to an all time high of     this year  effectively countering any misplaced concerns that admissions standards with regard to academic caliber might falter as part of a business school gender drive </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we have a great incoming class   says beth tidmarsh  director of admissions for kellogg s full time mba program   we were very fortunate to have a very strong applicant pool this year  which you can see in the increase in women and the increase in average gmat score   she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tidmarsh credits the impressive gain in female enrollment at kellogg this year in part to the exceptionally strong caliber of the overall applicant pool  but other factors  too  helped entice more women than ever to pursue their mba in evanston this year  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for starters  the school made some subtle but calculated shifts in its marketing strategy in the past year   we changed some of our messaging and focus to really talk about growth and especially personal growth   she says   i have found that resonates in particular with female applicants   so everywhere from its classrooms to its marketing materials  kellogg has placed greater emphasis on discussions of growth in people  in organizations  in industries  even the essays prospective applicants were asked to write as part of the admissions process had growth at their core  inviting applicants to reflect on how they have grown in the past and how they will grow at kellogg </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i also think that women are inspired by having a female dean   tidmarsh adds  sally blount  who joined kellogg as dean in       is one of a growing number of female deans at leading business schools  strong female alumnae also help convey the message that business school is very much a place where women can not only succeed but thrive  here tidmarsh points to dupont ceo ellen kullman  mba      and ggv capital managing partner jenny lee  mba      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but perhaps the greatest key influencer in helping boost kellogg s female enrollment to    percent was the school s partnership with the women s business association  wba   which with more than     members is the largest student led group on campus   the wba has put a lot of thought into meeting with the women who come to visit and tour kellogg  and i am wondering if it hasn t actually been the efforts our students have put in that have been most influential   tidmarsh says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wba spearheads high touch relationship building activities with admitted women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rebecca sholiton  kellogg wba co president for          played an active role in reaching out to prospective applicants and admitted students this past year as part of the wba s drive to increase female enrollment at kellogg   we personally hand wrote congratulatory notes to every single woman admit   she says  leading up to that  the wba hosted admitted student brunches in san francisco  washington  dc  and nearby chicago  where admits who were still deciding where they would ultimately enroll got to know current female mba students at kellogg better </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our team met a lot of women through those events  and when it came time to write notes we found we could actually write very personal things to these admitted women   sholiton says   that was something our team really had a lot of fun doing  </paragraph>

  <title>ut mccombs launches new linkedin recommendation option for mba applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning this application season  the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin will let mba applicants use recommendations from their linkedin profiles in lieu of traditional letters submitted by recommenders directly to the school  this new option  which went live with the mccombs s         full time mba application late last week  is a first among leading business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>feedback from previous applicants and admissions consultants drove the change  says rodrigo malta  mccombs director of mba admissions   we gather input from applicants at the end of each season  and one of the main pain points we identified were letters of recommendation   he says  every school was doing it differently  requiring applicants to go to recommenders with multiple requests   aigac  the association of international graduate admissions consultants  also gave us feedback about how painful the recommendation letter process was to both applicants and recommenders  even driving some applicants to draft and submit letters on behalf of their recommenders   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another drawback to traditional letters of recommendation is that they don t add value to the applicant s own process  malta says  while they provide valuable insight to the admissions team  applicants often don t even see them   we like to think of the application process as something really introspective applicants are writing essays and thinking about their future but the recommendation letters are really just for us   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking outside of the admission process for inspiration to arrive at a better solution  malta and his team reviewed the process they use when hiring colleagues    we go out and look at people s linkedin profiles  and the recommendations they have there carry a lot of weight as we are evaluating them for a job   he says   really  the genesis was  what do we do outside of the admissions process to have a more independent view of the applicant for a job and how can we have that carry over to the application process    malta says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the just launched mccombs mba application  applicants do still have the ability to ask their recommenders to submit traditional letters of recommendation  but now they can also opt to invite them to submit a linkedin recommendation on their individual linkedin profile pages </paragraph>
    <paragraph>from an operational standpoint it s quite easy  says malta  applicants simply direct the mccombs team to their linkedin profile and tell them what recommendation to look for  and then the team goes out during the review process and reads the recommendation online  malta and his team had already taken steps to make the mccombs recommendation letters open ended  as part of implementing the linkedin recommendation option for mba applicants  they scaled back from two questions to just one  which invites recommenders to comment about the applicant s performance  potential fit with the program and other information they deem relevant </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by being part of the applicant s online profile  the linkedin recommendation becomes something useful beyond the application process  malta notes  serving to strengthen the applicant s profile in preparation for a career search while at mccombs  additionally  the public nature of a linkedin recommendation also stands to benefit the school   anything that is out in the public gives us a little more assurance that it is going to be true   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>malta doesn t expect a linkedin recommendation to become a required part of the application process anytime soon  though   having the traditional recommendation letter option remains important for those in the military who may have a high security clearance  for example  or for international applicants who don t have access to linkedin   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>giving applicants options has worked well in the past  he adds  noting the success of the mccombs application essay  which applicants can choose to respond to in writing  via a video submission or through an about me page </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the new linkedin recommendation option for mba applicants is really our attempt to make the process less painful for both applicant and recommender  give people options  get what we need and also maybe give something back to the applicant   he says </paragraph>

  <title>livewire data offers interesting insights into admissions results</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit launched its mba livewire feature in december       giving applicants unique real time insight into how their peers are faring in the admissions process at    leading mba programs around the world  perhaps most fun  livewire lets people share the good news when they are accepted to their target school  it also gives those still waiting to hear a heads up that decisions are rolling out  but more than that  seeing the self reported gmat scores and gpas of other applicants also enables those who follow livewire to benchmark their own credentials against their peers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  with almost eight months of collected data  livewire also provides a means of analyzing prior admissions cycles  in fact  we have just undertaken the first analysis of livewire responses  and the scatterplot here showcases what we ve found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before getting into what it all means  we should note that there is some restriction of range here i e  there aren t very many people reporting gmat scores below     which probably indicates some response bias  in other words  applicants who scored well on the gmat or had strong gpas may be more inclined to share their numbers publically  albeit anonymously  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with that limitation in mind  the responses we received are interesting in that gpa and gmat alone do not seem to predict admissions results </paragraph>
    <paragraph> on the one hand  the data tell us that if you have a     gpa or less and a     or less on the gmat  you are pretty much out of luck at the top schools   says clear admit co founder eliot ingram   this confirms what we have known to be true  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> but it also reveals that having a      gmat and a      gpa doesn t ensure that you will get in either   he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in short  bad numbers can keep you out  but good numbers by no means guarantee acceptance </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is actually good news for our readers   ingram points out   it means that ultimate admissions decisions have more to do with other factors within the application process essays  interviews  the overall message applicants communicate about their candidacy   he continues   all of which is still very much in their control  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>expanded livewire features for upcoming round   because livewire launched well into round   last year  most of our findings to date apply to the second and subsequent rounds  this year  in time to capture upcoming round   data  we have expanded livewire s capabilities  which should yield even greater analytic insight </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beginning this week  we have enabled applicants to share more of their admissions journey  including indicating where they have applied  as well as where they have chosen to enroll </paragraph>
    <paragraph>livewire participants can score special discounts on clear admit products an additional new field within livewire now invites any applicants who so chose to share their email addresses  while entirely optional  sharing this information will enable us to follow up with special promotional offers tailored to your target schools   share that you ve been invited to interview at chicago booth  for example  and you could receive a discount on the clear admit chicago booth interview guide  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you do elect to share your email address  rest assured that this information will not appear in the livewire feed your submissions will still appear entirely anonymous to other livewire followers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while decisions for the           admissions cycle continue to trickle in  livewire is poised to really pick up again now as we head into the           cycle  remember  your window into real time admissions results is only a click away  don t miss this opportunity to keep your finger on the pulse  of course  the more people who contribute  the better sense everyone gets of the overall admissions cycle  so don t just watch other people s results roll in share your own as well </paragraph>

    <author>Admissions Director Q&A</author>

  <title>admissions director q a  sara neher of uva s darden school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we recently caught up with sara neher  director of mba admissions at darden school of business at the university of virginia  uva   who had just returned from a family trip to celebrate her dad s   th birthday in the mountains of colorado  trading one beautiful environment for another  she s back now in charlottesville and ready to dive into the mba admissions cycle just as it begins to heat up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>neher  who celebrates her ninth anniversary as director of admissions this month  says she initially turned down an invitation to work at darden  after five years in sales at proctor   gamble including completing an mba at emory s goizueta school of business while working she returned to her home state and undergraduate alma mater to work for the jefferson scholars foundation  which offers merit based scholarship aid to exceptional undergraduates  graduate students and professors to come study and teach at uva  during that time  the foundation launched a scholarship program with darden for mba students   i met the dean everyone was speaking my mba language and they said they had a vacancy at darden in admissions   she recalls  to which she replied   no  i love my job  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a few months later  neher found she d had a change of heart  as director of the jefferson scholars undergrad scholarship program  she had worked with several classes of really accomplished  driven young students   typically  i was the only woman with an mba they had ever met   she says   they weren t seeing the mba as a path especially the women and i thought   maybe this is my chance to do something about that    fortunately for her and for darden they hadn t yet filled the position </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she concedes that change has come slower than she might have liked in terms of increasing female enrollment   it has taken me a long time to get more women in the program  but that and increasing diversity in general is something i think a lot about   she says   and i am glad to say that it has changed a great deal since i got here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  neher talks about the arrival this week of darden s new dean  what she ll miss most about departing dean bob bruner and the  surprising to some  diversity of the school s alumni network  she also describes in detail just how the application process unfolds and how best to approach the school s essay  don t miss out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what s the single most exciting development  change or event happening at darden this the coming year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sara neher  that s easy  the new dean  scott beardsley  his first official day was monday  but i had been emailing with him a lot before that  i foresee his arrival as bringing a lot of good change  we all have a lot of excitement around the network that he brings to us and his ideas and strategic vision </paragraph>
    <paragraph>scott is very different from outgoing dean bruner  for starters  he has a huge european network  one of the first things we are doing is going to europe with him  of course  he also has the mckinsey network and all the companies he has worked with through mckinsey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he is very passionate about getting the right people in the rooms  and i am excited about what he is going to bring to all sides  although what he ll bring to recruiting here at darden is most immediately evident </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for what i ll miss the most about dean bruner  i think his compassion is probably the closest word i can think of  having been at darden for as long as he had  he had such an understanding for all the staff and faculty and really tried to help them do anything they wanted to do  his approach was always   let s get in the trenches and figure out how to do this the best way possible  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he just had such compassion and understanding for others  the students could tell he cared about them  we had lunch with him just the admissions office to say goodbye  he traveled with us  he really got to know us  so the farewell lunch gave us an opportunity to tell him what we appreciated about him  and he in turn gave us some tips about how he thinks we should onboard scott </paragraph>

  <title>haas accenture partnership creates new big data curriculum</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>from financial services to retail to utilities  companies in an ever increasing range of industries are exploring and implementing big data and analytics  to equip its mbas with the tools they need to understand how data science stands to transform business  the haas school at the university of california at berkeley has forged a new partnership with global management consulting  technology and outsourcing company accenture  together  they have launched a multi phase initiative designed to position big data squarely within the haas curriculum </paragraph>
    <paragraph> today  every company is a technology company  every company is a software company  every company is a data company   says gregory la blanc  a finance and technology lecturer at haas   to be successful  our students need to know how to navigate the strategic landscape in a world filled with all this data  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>la blanc has been teaching at haas for    years  including a course called data and decisions that every haas mba takes when he or she first arrives on campus   it s kind of a combination of statistics  critical thinking  inference  persuasion and quantitative reasoning all wrapped up in one   he explains  adding that it was created about five years ago as an improvement on traditional statistics </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we figured that statistics the way it is traditionally taught doesn t really get the job done   he says   it s very formula driven  mechanical  repetitive and it wasn t giving business students the ability to think clearly  make good decisions  know when to believe things  how to ask questions  how to design things and develop hypotheses  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>data and decisions tackles how to solve business problems using standard technology  sampling and experimentation   but the rise of big data allows us to do so much more   explains leblanc  indeed  understanding how to access and analyze big data whether it s complex files of    terabytes or more  massive amounts of information gathered from social networks or unstructured data such as video and voice promises to be one of the most significant transformations in business since the industrial revolution  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we wanted students to learn about these new technologies that people are using and to think very deeply about the strategic implications how do you monetize it  how do you design a business strategy around it   la blanc says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas accenture partnership is born and so this past spring  la blanc kicked off the first phase of a partnership between haas and accenture to develop a curriculum around big data  teaching a new course called data science data strategy </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the class was trying to do a lot of things   la blanc explains  for starters  it was intended to provide an introduction to data science methodologies and techniques from decision trees and logistical regression to nearest neighbor clustering  that said  the idea was not to turn the mba students into data scientists themselves   we even had everyone do things in excel because we didn t want them to have to learn a new language   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after an intro to data science fundamentals  the course s focus shifted to strategy  specifically how to develop strategy around data  and then it was time to hear from people from industry through a lecture series that included executives from dozens of companies   we had a lot of people come in from all sorts of companies ge  wells fargo  ups  facebook  cloudera  tamr and others to talk about what they think is happening in this space  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>accenture presented a perfect partner  la blanc says  noting that the consulting firm has been making inroads in data analytics work and building a practice around understanding the intersection between data science and business strategy  beyond providing a sounding board as la blanc and colleagues began to craft the curriculum for the new course  accenture also supported the lecture series  including helping secure some of the speakers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but accenture s most important contribution to the class was exposing students to what they are doing with clients  la blanc says  in april  accenture welcomed the students in the class to its san jose technology lab  where they got to see live demonstrations highlighting current analytics research and engage in in depth conversations with accenture executives </paragraph>
    <paragraph> accenture believes that the best way to demystify a typical data driven consulting engagement is to go through the process of working with clients and data scientists to achieve desired solutions and outcomes   says prith banerjee  managing director of global technology research and development at accenture   data science projects can be considered a  black box  for business managers and non technical strategists  but this exercise empowers students to feel comfortable making impactful data driven decisions and thereby help their future organizations do the same  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second new course debuts this fall as the second phase of the haas accenture partnership around big data  haas will offer another new course  applied data analytics  this fall  also developed in partnership with accenture  this course will be taught by haas lecturer dave rochlin and thomas lee  a visiting assistant professor and research scientist </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we felt like we really want to give students an opportunity to delve in deeper and do project based work   says rochlin  who also serves as executive director of haas work  a program that sends haas mba students to global firms to research business challenges   with accenture  we ve been examining how to put together a project based course that lets students work on real time  urgent  client based challenges  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the usual processing methods don t work with these data sets and the only way for mbas to really learn how to handle big data is to actually work with it  and to interact with student engineers and data scientists   la blanc says   this relationship with accenture gives students that opportunity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new course will be based on a  learning by doing  aspect that is central at haas   we are always looking at how we can create an appropriate  learn by doing  environment   rochlin says  as part of the new course  haas students will partner with students from the uc school of information  together these student teams will have access to accenture data scientists  projects and clients and will work on projects in real time with real data   they will go from trying to frame the problem to evaluating alternate ways to do the modeling  from examining what additional data needs to be obtained to how confident you can be based on the data you have   rochlin says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in particular  rochlin hopes the experience can help encourage students to take a more exploratory and diverse approach to working with big data   a current approach in using data analytics is to find extremely narrow problems and use the data to check it   he says   the next generation is figuring out how to use big data even when you don t know what question you should be asking  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the course they are devising for the fall  multiple teams will work on the same problem  la blanc says   we very much expect them to take different approaches and come up with different answers   he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas accenture partnership yields mutual benefits accenture has been interested both in finding partners they can collaborate with and learn from  but also in helping develop business school graduates who have the knowledge and skills to incorporate data analytics into their jobs and understand the value and power of that work  rochlin says   we started out talking about a very broad agenda and quickly realized there were a lot of overlaps between what they were interested in doing and what we were interested in doing   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we see a marketplace need for analytically oriented business leaders who are both able to make decisions grounded in data as well as rethink their organization s business processes to fully realize the potential of emerging analytical approaches   banerjee says  indeed  accenture has partnered not only with haas but also with the massachusetts institute of technology and other schools in the hopes of building a pipeline of potential employees with these valuable skillsets </paragraph>
    <paragraph> through this initiative  we hope participating business school students will gain the experience of working together on an interdisciplinary team that uses data  visualization and critical thinking to establish business strategy  answer data driven questions and achieve better business outcomes   banerjee continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>far from turning mbas into data scientists  la blanc hopes that the initiative will help haas students better understand where their role ends and the role of data scientists begins   too often  mba students graduate and are thrust into an engagement with a data scientist without knowing how to interact  how to ask the best questions   he says   this initiative  by providing a little bit of exposure to data analysis techniques  will give them authority to make decisions they are qualified to make   he says   exposure to data scientists in the experiential classroom will help mbas figure out their own strengths and weaknesses while learning to interact and manage teams  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the shape of big data curriculum to come beyond launching the new data analytics course this fall  la blanc and rochlin are already looking ahead toward the future of haas s big data curriculum  for starters  they plan to split the data science data strategy course into two parts   the speakers will all be split out into a separate speaker series  which will allow us to delve deeper into the data science   la blanc says  this deeper dive is facilitated in part by the fact that it is becoming increasingly easy for students to handle big data without having to learn new languages  he continues   because so many software programs today are so easy to learn just extensions of excel the students don t have to learn how to code  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rochlin  for his part  predicts that the line between poets and quants in business schools will grow increasingly blurred   some mbas come into business school and embrace the science  while others consider themselves to be more strategy focused   he says   but moving forward  that artificial division is not going to stand up  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in time  specific classes in data strategy and data science will no longer be required because they will be part of every class  la blanc predicts   ten years from now you won t be able to talk about finance marketing organizational behavior without it being evidence based finance marketing organizational behavior   he says   data will be an integral part of every course  everything will be based on data  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but for now  la blanc and rochlin  together with partners at accenture  are excited to roll out haas s new big data curriculum </paragraph>

  <title>financing your mba  part iv</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in our previous post on financing your mba  we covered loan programs for mba students from the united states  today  we ll take a look at loans through the lens of international students  who face some different restrictions but who are also eligible for special programs tailored to their unique requirements </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by law  federal loans can only be distributed to u s  citizens or permanent residents  this means that international students must put extra work into finding financial aid and loan programs to support their education if they choose to pursue a u s  mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>international students should research their own countries  options for financing studies abroad  and schools  financial aid offices are also useful resources in this regard  for instance  harvard lists    scholarship or fellowship opportunities for students of particular nationalities  this list includes financing opportunities for harvard students alone as well as universal fellowship options   mit sloan lists    scholarships or fellowships geared towards international students  and columbia business school provides an even more in depth explanation of resources  discussing both scholarship search engines for international students and country specific opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph> private lenders for international students international students can also consider u s  based private loans  but they should recognize that many of these loan programs require a u s  co signer  understanding that this can prove a hardship for those without a u s  connection  some schools offer internal options for international students  for instance  harvard business school has partnered with the harvard university employees credit union to offer private educational loans that do not require a u s  co signer  nyu stern also features a list on its website of loan providers that don t require international students to have a u s  co signer  consulting with your target schools  financial aid offices is a great way to learn about available loan options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>international students should keep in mind that u s  lenders are typically not allowed to issue loans to students from countries on the united states treasury department s office of foreign assets control  ofac  sanctions list   the treasury department encourages prospective students to check this list with some regularity  as it is frequently updated </paragraph>
    <paragraph>also addressing the need for non co signer loans  companies like prodigy finance have entered the market in recent years  founded by insead alumni who faced funding challenges themselves as international mba students  prodigy offers loans using an innovative community financed model in which alumni  institutional investors and qualified private investors fund the next generation of mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>next up in our series  we ll begin to explore the range of scholarship  fellowship and other programs providing additional means of financing your mba </paragraph>

  <title>gmac debuts interactive post mba salary estimator</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>especially given the price tag that accompanies obtaining an mba from a leading business school  it would be foolhardy for prospective applicants not to give careful consideration to the degree s return on investment  roi   this  of course  will depend on the career you pursue after graduation and the salary you are able to command in that role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>turns out you re in luck  the graduate management admission council  gmac   which administers the gmat entrance exam  has created a new tool designed to help prospective applicants estimate the salary they can expect to earn after completing their degree  prospective students enter their intended industry and job function  and the tool then parses data compiled by gmac s surveys of thousands of mba alumni to return a tailored salary estimate  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  gmac notes  the advantages of an mba extend well beyond greater earning potential   as a graduate you ll enjoy a competitive edge in the job market  meet and interact with an impressive cohort of fellow professionals  create lasting connections with your classmates  and enjoy new and challenging opportunities   reads a gmac press release announcing the new tool  still  understanding how the degree can impact your earning power is critical in terms of deciding when and whether you can afford to make the investment in business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac s annual survey of corporate recruiters  conducted from february through march       revealed encouraging results in terms of the starting salaries      mba grads were expected to fetch  recruiters at the     employers surveyed reported plans to offer recent mba grads a median starting salary of          compared with a median of         for bachelor s grads  of course  median means just that the middle number in a given sequence of numbers  and in the case of post mba salaries  that sequence of numbers might range anywhere from         a year with a non profit or in an emerging economy to          or more for select mba grads going into senior roles in private equity or venture capital  for example </paragraph>
    <paragraph>enter gmac s new post mba salary estimator  this interactive tool was designed to tap gmac s extensive data drawn from more than       alumni to help prospective mba students estimate the salary they can reasonably expect to draw based on multiple factors unique to their own situation  including target industry and job level </paragraph>
    <paragraph>simply indicate the industry and job level you hope to enter upon graduation  and the gmac tool will provide the median salary for graduates matching your selections  this information promises to be much more relevant than the median salaries for all mba grads  in addition  if you provide an email address  the tool will also serve up supporting information drawn from gmac s surveys of alumni  including   th and   th salary percentiles  levels and sources of career success  degree value  knowledge usage and personal career impact </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while it s no crystal ball as actual post graduation salaries will obviously depend on multiple factors unique to each individual the new gmac salary estimator can be a useful tool as you evaluate the impact obtaining an mba can have on your future or as you weigh different potential career transitions </paragraph>

  <title>financing your mba  part iii</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>moving right along in our multi part series on financing your mba  we ll take a look today at some of the options prospective mba students have for obtaining loans to finance their time at business school  for the purposes of this post  we will focus primarily on loan programs for u s  students  international students  stay tuned for subsequent posts that will go into greater detail about loan programs tailored for your needs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  because loans must ultimately be repaid unlike scholarship or fellowship aid deciding how much you should borrow is as important as understanding how much you can borrow  to make an informed decision about the amount of student loan debt you can take on and reasonably expect to repay  you ll need to consider your current finances and any loans or other debt you may already have  program costs  other potential sources of funding  scholarships  savings  etc   and your anticipated salary increase upon graduation  as well as estimated loan repayments and interest and fees   the department of education s website for repayment plans features a range of online calculators to help you calculate loan payments based on the amount you plan to borrow and how quickly you are able to repay  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>federal loan programs for u s  citizens and permanent residents  the most widely used loan programs are those provided through the u s  government  these specifically include the direct loan program  the direct plus loan program and the federal perkins loan program  through these programs  students can borrow the cost of attendance  as determined by the school  minus any financial aid packages they receive  in order to remain eligible for government loans  students must ensure that their total debt from subsidized and unsubsidized loans  including federal undergraduate loans  remains under          </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the direct loan program offers graduate students unsubsidized loans of up to         at an interest rate of      percent  there is an ordination fee of   percent of the loan deducted from each loan disbursement  and interest accrues throughout a student s time in school and during deferment and grace periods  while graduate students were previously able to borrow up to        with interest delayed until after graduation  the budget control act of      eliminated graduate direct subsidized loans in july      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students with good credit histories may also consider applying for a federal plus loan  the interest rate on these loans is fixed at      percent for the life of the loan  there is also a     percent ordination fee that is deducted from each loan disbursement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students with exceptional financial need  and who are matriculating at participating schools  may also apply through their school s financial aid office for a perkins loan of up to        per year at a   percent interest rate  there are no other fees associated with this loan  students should keep in mind  however  that their school determines who receives this loan  and participating schools do not necessarily reserve funds for their mba students  also  there is a         cap on how much you can borrow in total as a graduate student  which includes any amounts you may have borrowed as an undergraduate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fees and interests rates when deciding whether to take out loans  students should be sure to take the costs of fees and interest rates into account  for example  if a student borrows          in federal loans her first year  she will owe         in interest alone  as well as the principle loan  by the time she enters the workplace </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how to apply for federal loans the free application for federal student aid  fafsa  is an online form that determines the loan eligibility of u s  citizens and permanent residents  available on january  st each year  the fafsa can be submitted online or mailed in by either downloading the pdf or requesting a paper based copy  the u s  department of education recommends submitting the form online to prevent any delays in processing the application </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while deadlines for submitting the fafsa vary  most schools recommend completing the form as soon as possible in order to ensure applicants do not lose out on available funds  the fafsa does require information about income from that year s tax return for example  the      fafsa asks for information from the      tax return but applicants can use the previous year s tax return to approximate their income or use the fafsa income estimator tool  after filing their taxes  applicants can then use the irs data retrieval tool to update their fafsa  processing takes three to five days for electronically filed fafsas  schools have access to a student s completed fafsa one day after it is finished processing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>private lenders to cover the rest of their expenses  students may wish to explore private loan options through a bank or other lender  schools generally encourage students to exhaust all possible scholarship  fellowships and federal loan options before turning to alternative private loans given the typically higher interest rates these parties offer  however  applicants with excellent credit scores may be able to secure private loans that offer a better interest rate or lower ordination fee than federal loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>private loans have much stricter eligibility requirements than federal loans  lenders can decline to issue a loan  require a co signer or set higher interest rates for a number of different reasons  including a credit score  this score  which typically ranges from a  poor      to a  strong       is based on factors such as an applicant s payment history  debt ratio  types of credit and length of credit history  those with a history of late payments on credit cards or other loans  or who owe a significant amount of money compared to their credit limit  tend to have low credit scores  and these individuals may face higher interest rates on private loans as a result  in addition  applicants with little to no credit history or who are from outside the u s  may need a co signer  or someone who agrees to take on full financial responsibility for a loan should a borrower fail to pay it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while schools generally do not endorse a preferred lender  citing conflict of interest  they do sometimes list reputable lenders their students have used in the past on their financial aid websites  students can also reach out to their local banks or other lenders  or research national programs such as pnc  wells fargo  sallie mae  or discover card s mba loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>next up in our series  we ll look more closely at loan opportunities for international students  stay tuned </paragraph>

  <title>darden s dean is bullish on school s future as he prepares to depart</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we had the distinct pleasure of speaking recently with bob bruner  who for the past    years has served as dean of the darden school of business at the university of virginia  he will step down at the end of this month  when scott beardsley becomes the ninth dean of the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the wide ranging interview that follows  dean bruner reflects on his time at darden  the strengths his successor will bring in his role as darden s dean  the state of graduate management education and why he is optimistic about darden s future </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  he was thoughtful and engaging  with valuable insights for anyone considering business school  whether at darden or elsewhere  we are so grateful to him for making the time to speak with us </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what are you most proud of in your time as darden s dean </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bob bruner  the school has accomplished many great things in a short space of time  but i am most proud of darden s ability to attract stronger and stronger entering classes of students  i believe the ability of schools to recruit up is a prime measure of their vitality  our full time residential mba program has shown wonderful advancement in its caliber of students and boasts wonderful diversity in terms of industry  gender  citizenship  race  ethnicity  you name it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our students all possess very strong and rising academic potential  as well as strong leadership skills and communication skills  and what we are hearing from recruiters is the rising attraction of our students which is evident in our placement results over time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i believe that darden s ability to continue to recruit up is the start of a virtuous cycle  attracting stronger and stronger students makes it easier to attract stronger faculty  both of which lead to program innovation and a strengthening of program quality  which in turn leads to rising recognition for the school and the ability to engage a broader set of external stakeholders  this then leads to fundraising capability </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i do see in the industry the possibility of a downward spiral as well  a pernicious self reinforcing cycle  the virtuous cycle i mentioned before can move in the opposite direction  sadly  i see in our field business schools that are struggling with the ability to attract strong students and faculty or implement program innovation  there are some very good schools whose missions are quite worthy  and yet they are finding it difficult to recruit up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden  though  is in the first group  in great part this is because of our culture  we have an extremely strong teaching culture  which has led to favorable word on the street about the school   the school has been acknowledged by external sources and rankings and publications such as yours as being a place with very strong values toward the student </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a characteristic of the millennial generation is that they focus quite intentionally on value received for value given  and i think these students are paying quite keen attention to the value they will gain </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden is part of the experience economy  which is different from the commodity economy  the experience economy attracts people consumers who are interested not just in getting a thing but also in the experience that thing offers  take buying a notebook computer  for example  you can buy hardware at bottom dollar at the bare bones functionality that you need and not pay very much money  indeed  the price of computers is continuing to plummet  or  you can focus on a computer as an experience and this is where steve jobs at apple was genius  an apple goes on in brilliant colors and talks to you and prompts you intuitively to do what you need to do to boot up  that creates an experience of awe  harley davidson  disney these are also companies that have mastered the experience economy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and so it is in the world of management education  there are providers who give you the bare bones at very inexpensive rates and then there is a very small set of the total market that is the antithesis  that is oriented toward providing a total experience intended to be transformational  darden is one of the leaders in the transformational experience segment of the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba students are very  very careful shoppers  i respect them totally  they figure it out  they are able to distinguish darden from schools x  y and z  they will decide whether darden is their cup of tea or whether they want something more bare bones and undifferentiated  but there is a segment of the market that is intensely  passionately oriented toward wanting a transformational experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we get between eight and nine applicants per seat at darden  and that s because we are able to construct an entering class and deliver an experience that students rave about  that has helped us to continue to recruit up and produced a self reinforcing  virtuous cycle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what have you left undone in your time as darden s dean </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  let me just say that i am totally humbled by the experience of being a dean  there is more unfinished business  and i will be the very first to admit it  it goes to the very dynamic nature of management education  there continue to be major opportunities for darden in the areas of digital learning and field based education  getting students out of the classroom and into the field working with practicing executives   there are also still major opportunities in the field of globalization  particularly in getting american students out of the united states  there is also more to be done in terms of serving different demographic subsets of the field  pre career  mid career  advanced career stages   i could go on and on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i often hear critics of management education saying this is a moribund field a field that hasn t changed  that suffers from terrible inertia  that is a dinosaur on its way out  i will just look those people straight in the eye and tell them they are flat wrong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what i see is a group of players in the field who are investing very heavily in new curriculum  new talent  new experiences  what is not publicly known are the failures and experiences that bombed and didn t work  but we should be trying lots of little bets  we need to be experimenting widely  aggressively  broadly experimenting in little ways because that is what business does </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if we aren t failing in some regularly routine way  we aren t trying hard enough  i think my colleagues see this  there is this other notion that academics don t experiment enough  and that is just flat wrong as well  i think  experimentation  is the ticket for management education going forward </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of my favorite books right now is called little bets by peter sims  i have given copies of it far and wide to my colleagues and some of my alums  in it he describes this philosophy of investing in little ways to discover things that warrant more investigation  i have regular conversations with deans at peer schools  and they are doing much the same  it helps to hear what they are doing  there is an effervescence of innovation taking place  which ultimately makes me very optimistic about the future of the field  i think    years from now management education could well be very different from what it is today of course  it will create some winners and some losers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how confident are you in your successor  scott beardsley  what advice have you offered him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  he is a living breathing embodiment of the book little bets  scott beardsley is a    year veteran of mckinsey  and he has been the leader of internal education for mckinsey  in fact  he may very well have had something to do with the ideas embedded in the book </paragraph>
    <paragraph>my advice to him has been heavily oriented toward making the leap from business into academia on listening well and adapting to what might seem to outsiders to be an unusual environment  to outsiders  higher education can seem overly collegial and very slow moving  when in fact a lot of change is taking place but is not evident to the naked eye </paragraph>
    <paragraph>scott beardsley s great strength is in asking questions  he has impressed me greatly in his ability through a dialectical process to sort out in his own mind what needs to happen but to lead others to it in a socratic fashion  i am optimistic about his ability to make the leap into academia  but it is a stretch for anyone moving into the dean s role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what will you miss the most about being darden s dean  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i love developing people and helping to give them assignments and provide resources in ways that allow them do their best work  it is intensely fulfilling to see a high potential colleague absolutely blossom in his or her professional capabilities  shedding my responsibility as dean means shedding that opportunity somewhat  but i will continue to do that as a professor among colleagues and i will certainly mentor junior colleagues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i have been thrilled at the range of relationships one develops as dean relationships with students  alumni  donors  corporations  some have been transformational for me personally and also very fulfilling  and they have had lovely results  such as completing a major capital campaign and helping to direct the school in new ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what will you miss the least </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  travel  the middle seat of airlines   yes  i still fly economy   staying in hotels and the like  i have averaged     days per year out of town in my    years as dean  and i intend to cut way  way  way back on that </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i look forward to doing things that i have missed  i love to teach  i love to write i averaged authoring or co authoring a book a year in the years before i became dean  and i look forward to returning to that  and i very much look forward to helping students in a classroom setting again </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what will you do during your year away before you return to darden to teach </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i will spend a month in europe traveling with my wife  i owe her considerable catch up time  after that i will divide the year between harvard business school  hbs  and another school on the west coast  though the exact mix of that time remains to be finely tuned  i might spend most of the year at hbs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the purpose of going away is that it helps the new dean get traction and it helps the outbound dean reboot in terms of teaching and writing  i will spend the year developing concepts for new courses  developing some book outlines  probably even writing chapters of one or two books  in essence  i will be restarting my intellectual life as a professor </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during that year i am not going to teach  consult or give speeches i have turned down lots and lots of invitations for those things  instead i will dive deeply back into my intellectual life  but at the conclusion of the year  i very much look forward to returning to darden </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what do you see as your successor s greatest strengths </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  there is one dimension in which he really resonates with me  i will miss the ability to help develop people  and he is passionate about developing people  both students and his colleagues  i think that bodes very favorably for the future of the school  he is passionate  too  about the role of education in society and the transformational impact it can have </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he is also just a very warm individual  easy to meet  to get to know  very american  he plays guitar in a garage rock and roll band  he is a very  very highly ranked tennis player  he is keenly interested in the student experience straightforwardly  and i think these will all prove to be particular strengths to him as he comes into our community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the real core that i am talking about here is i think he s got our values  within the darden program  one of the key ideas we teach is that high performance is really driven by values  not by dollars  we are heavily a values  and mission driven community  and so is scott  so i feel very good about his stepping into this role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what has been the greatest transformation in graduate management education over the past    years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i d say it s a toss up between globalization and digital learning  both of those were highly accelerated by the global financial crisis  nobody anticipated the global financial crisis  but it accelerated a set of trends in the field that are most visible in terms of cross border mobility of students and schools  use of digital learning  the association to advance collegiate schools of business  aacsb  led a report on the globalization of management education it was really a wake up call to business schools and their deans saying   look this is not a fad  this is a long term secular trend toward increased mobility of students  faculty and programs across borders and it is going to demand adaptation among leading programs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the global financial crisis also forced business schools to reexamine their use of digital technology as a way to reach a broader public  in june       the darden school signed an agreement with coursera to offer moocs  massive open online courses   and the university of virginia followed very quickly  to date  darden has enrolled more than half a million students in coursera  and uva  another half million </paragraph>
    <paragraph>those numbers dwarf the total number of graduates of darden or uva  now  cynics always point to the fact that not all students complete moocs  but even if you only look at the completion rates  the numbers continue to dwarf the number of students on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if we are in the business of transforming society by developing responsible leaders and by doing research  the digital medium opens up vast possibilities  we have taken those experiments  grown those that were successful and offered a broader range of courses  we are doing more in our executive education programs  and we will do more in our two year residential mba program  some people do say   but darden is one of the leaders in face to face classroom teaching why are we going digital  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to them i say it is not either or  it is both and  the technology very probably will help us deliver ideas and knowledge in ways that frees up time for us to do more things that are deeply in service to our students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>going forward  we need to ask very tough minded questions about what technology will do  back in       i couldn t have guessed that globalization and technology would prove to be so disruptive  those two forces will continue to be enormously disruptive in the    years to come </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is one other phenomenon that i see playing a very serious role in the time to come  i have written about in it my blog as the  winners take all  phenomenon in higher education  basically  it says that rewards accrue asymmetrically to players in a field of competition such that the players who establish a track record of high performance tend to capture a disproportionate share of the benefits of that performance </paragraph>
    <paragraph>michael jordan stands out as one of history s greats in basketball and his financial rewards and brand value are way out of proportion to the fact that he was a member of a team that was very successful  and that team was one of a professional league of basketball players  and the benefits accrued to professional teams are themselves way out of proportion to sports teams in general </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in this blog of mine i deliver a number of graphs and tables that show that gains accrue disproportionately to high performing schools  if this continues for the next    years  we will see a widening gap between the haves and have nots much like the highly discussed income inequality gap </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  as dean of a school that seems to be on the winning side of the entire field  you wouldn t think that i would be the one to wring my hands and warn everyone about it  but i care very much about the success of higher education worldwide  and i think there is going to be a shakeout at the end of all of this that will impact business schools at the lower and middle ends of the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i see this as problematic because one size does not fit all  we have benefited from providing a wide variety of different offerings  today  a student who wants an mba at the lowest prices can find one  as can a student who wants a part time program  an executive mba  variety is what makes a market  our very broad and highly segmented market has been a good thing for students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to the extent that there is a shakeout at the middle and low end of the field  we will lose diversity  the total volume of mba applicants has plateaued and is declining  to our great fortune in america this has been offset by applicants from outside the united states  but i think the demographic trend among developed economies is not buoyant for the field in general  and the winners and losers will be even more starkly defined in the future  again  darden has been fortunate to recruit up  but if the application trends in america continue as they are  the future will be more and more painful for the have nots in the field  i would be sorry to see that happen </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  as you prepare to step down as darden s dean  what do you find to be most top of mind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  my own transition has prompted students to come and congratulate me on my retirement  but i am quick to point out that i am not retiring that i will be coming back to darden  maybe we can call it  recycling   i ve offered   no  that makes you sound like a plastic bottle   students have said   repurposed   i suggest   that makes you sound like an old piece of machinery   they reply   you are being reinvented  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i find all of this humorous  and i take it all in good spirit  but top of mind for me right now is the fact that all of us in academia and really everyone needs to think about what are the opportunities and challenges embedded in this incredible demographic transition about to take place  baby boomers are moving out of management  it will take many years for that to become manifest  but what people need to be thinking about what i find myself thinking about most is how to harness the accumulated experience of that generation  all the while continuing to invent something new </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i look at my colleagues who are of a similar age to me  and they intend to contribute very actively in whatever role they are in  i think i like the  reinvention  word best  i think there is a lovely opportunity in this generational transformation that is about to take place  i don t have any answers for what lies ahead  but my successor will have to deal with that and i look forward to helping </paragraph>

  <title>new associate dean to spearhead growing entrepreneurship at yale som</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as a reflection of the growing importance of entrepreneurship at the yale school of management  som   the director of the school s entrepreneurship initiatives has been appointed associate dean  the school announced earlier this month </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kyle jensen joined yale som last year as the inaugural shanna and eric bass     director of entrepreneurship  under his leadership  the school s program on entrepreneurship added seven new entrepreneurship courses last year  drawing students from the entire university </paragraph>
    <paragraph> even in the first year of the effort to build out the entrepreneurship program  the program has become a center of activity at the school and has engaged the rest of yale university   som dean edward snyder said as part of a story on the yale som website   kyle s leadership and the energy he brings to this new role are exemplary  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it was based in part on this success that jensen was appointed to the additional role as associate dean  snyder says  jensen s hiring last year grew out of a task force led by len baker  yc       a partner at venture capital firm sutter hill ventures  which provided recommendations for the school s strategy on entrepreneurship  houston based velite benchmark capital management managing partner eric bass  som      and his spouse  shanna bass  made a gift to endow jensen s position </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his inaugural year as director of entrepreneurship  jensen developed a variety of classes and extracurricular programs  including a survey course called  entrepreneurship and new ventures  and a practicum in which students work on their own startups  yale som also now boasts a new entrepreneurial studies suite in edward p  evans hall </paragraph>
    <paragraph>concurrent with jensen s appointment last year  yale som established two new merit based scholarships for students in each entering mba class  which are granted on the basis of demonstrated interest in entrepreneurship and future potential as an entrepreneur  yale som will also name up to five entrepreneurial fellows each year to receive two years of loan deferral after graduation to enable them to work full time on a startup </paragraph>
    <paragraph> yale  and yale som in particular  has the potential to be a real engine for innovation  and kyle has taken some big steps toward realizing that potential   baker said as part of the story on the yale som website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jensen  an entrepreneur  developer and scientist  co founded several companies before joining the yale som faculty  they include a boston based  venture backed biotechnology company called agrivida  a patent analytics provider called priorsmart  and pit rho  a motorsports analytics firm  his research interests include computational biology  intellectual property and the sociology of science </paragraph>
    <paragraph>heading entrepreneurship at yale som has been a joy thanks to the students  he says   i have a special commitment to those student entrepreneurs who chose to start ventures here and now during their brief tenure at yale   he said in the yale som article   it is a privilege to be in their service  and i am thankful for the adventure they inject into my life daily  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale features multiple resources for entrepreneurial students to pursue their ventures both inside and outside of class  jensen himself served as an entrepreneur in residence at the pan university yale entrepreneurial institute  additional support is provided through the center for engineering innovation and design  the center for biomedical and interventional technology  cbit   innovate health yale  the center for business and the environment  cbey   and the center for molecular discovery </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my colleagues in these groups are superb and they care deeply about helping yale founders build successful ventures   jensen says   that s where the real  high touch support happens  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because many students studying entrepreneurship at yale som will go on to positions at other firms before starting their own ventures  the school teaches a broad interpretation of entrepreneurship  jensen says   we teach how to be entrepreneurial  how to be innovative and how to lead others into the unknown in the pursuit of opportunity   this approach is designed to give students tools they can apply in their daily lives while also fitting into yale s liberal arts education focus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jensen s priorities in the year ahead as associate dean include expanding the use of mobile apps to enhance student participation in class  he also intends to continue taking advantage of yale som s participation in the global network for advanced management  which helps student startups with an international component find collaborators around the globe </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale som is certainly not alone among business schools in expanding its emphasis on and resources for entrepreneurship  last week  the university of michigan s ross school of business announced a     million alumni gift to support entrepreneurship at that school  of course  silicon valley schools like stanford graduate school of business and uc berkeley s haas school of business have long been at the forefront of entrepreneurship  with unique curriculum offerings as well as extensive experiential learning opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the basses  whose gift last year endowed jensen s position and helped jumpstart entrepreneurship at yale som  are thrilled with the progress they have seen   providing a structure to support student entrepreneurs is an important step for yale som   they said   we couldn t be more thrilled with the rapid growth of the program and the excitement about entrepreneurship at the school  </paragraph>

  </authors>
  <title>admissions director offers advice on kellogg s new essay questions</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we caught up with director of admissions beth tidmarsh late last week to discuss the new essay questions posted by the kellogg school of mangement on july  th  though the wording and order of the questions has changed slightly this year  applicants are asked  like last year  to respond to two required prompts and given     words in which to provide their answers  as in past years  applicants also have the opportunity to respond to an additional optional essay with no word limit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leadership and collaboration once again factor prominently into kellogg s new essay questions this year  but tidmarsh and her team hope the prompts provide applicants with a great deal of latitude in how they respond </paragraph>
    <paragraph> leadership continues to be something we are very focused on in evaluating applicants here at kellogg  but we also recognize the need to give applicants a chance to talk about leadership in different ways   tidmarsh says  her team recognizes that leadership styles vary greatly  people can be loud leaders  quiet leaders  strict leaders   we encourage applicants to take the opportunity and tell us what kind of leader they are   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we also recognize that leadership evidences itself in different ways   she continues  for some applicants  leadership may not be reflected in your job title  maybe you are a leader in a volunteer organization or as part of a smaller team at work  she offers  or maybe you demonstrate leadership in how you facilitate collaboration or take input from your team   we want to give applicants the opportunity to highlight and profile for us what they think it means to be a leader   she stresses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg is also recognized for the hands on role its students play in every aspect of the school   students are involved in our admit weekend  orientation week  revising school policies and processes so collaboration and teamwork factor prominently into our essay prompts   tidmarsh says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>together  the two essays are designed to help tidmarsh and her team assemble an incoming class that will thrive at kellogg  where leadership and student involvement are hallmarks of the mba program   it is our way of looking both for students who are going to be involved at kellogg and want to be part of that partnership and for people who are seeking to make an impact in the world and the future and be a future leader  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but she stresses once again that kellogg does not believe in a set mold for leadership   you don t have to be the class president while you re here or plan to be a ceo once you leave   she says   you can be a leader in many different ways  and that is what we are looking for applicants to demonstrate through their essays  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg seeks and brings about both personal and professional growth this year  one of kellogg s new essay questions explicitly invites applicants to reflect on both personal and professional growth in their past and in the time they might spend at kellogg  acknowledging that some people pursue the mba for purely professional reasons  while others are led to it as much by personal circumstances  tidmarsh notes that kellogg seeks and is open to both  while at kellogg  though  applicants should be prepared to grow in ways both personal and professional </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you do not come to kellogg to stay the same   she says   at kellogg  you are going to change both personally and professionally we want people who are coming here because they want to grow and change   she adds   we want you to think about and tell us about where you have been and where you think you are headed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in its prompt about leadership and teamwork  kellogg intentionally added the word  recent  to signal to applicants that they should draw from experiences in the past few years in their responses   a strong example would be something in the time horizon in which they have been working their career horizon to date   tidmarsh advises   going back into college can work for some people if the example is strong and appropriate   she continues  but experiences dating back more than that she does not think are as effective   if you are going back into high school it might lead us to wonder why you have to go back that far   she warns </paragraph>
    <paragraph>holistic application process seeks full picture of applicant like many leading business schools  kellogg s aim is for a holistic application process that evaluates the whole person  at kellogg  this goal has resulted in a long standing philosophy of granting interviews to any applicant who wants one  a practice that sets the school apart from many of its rivals   we still seek to interview everyone who applies as many as we can   tidmarsh says  to facilitate this  in addition to on campus interviews conducted by the admissions committee  alumni interviewers around the globe meet with applicants in their home countries </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in keeping with kellogg s goal of getting a full picture of its applicants  the application also features two extemporaneous video essays   we have had really good response to the video essays over the past two years and we are now going into our third year using them   tidmarsh says  she acknowledges that some applicants have heightened anxiety around this less familiar application component   but i find that once people get on the other side of it they say   oh  it wasn t really that bad at all    she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to quell some of the pre video jitters  kellogg provides guidelines to help applicants prepare for the video essay portions in advance  including advising them on what to wear  business casual dress  and where to do them  in a quiet space with good lighting   kellogg also posts    practice questions that applicants can rehearse responses to as many times as they want  jitters or not  applicants need to get the hang of video communication not only for the application but for the real world  tidmarsh points out   the world is headed in the direction of more and more video conferencing  and it is a skill for people to master and be comfortable with   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in keeping with the worldwide shift toward video communication that defies international boundaries  kellogg this year is increasing its investment in technology and webinars to make it easier for people around the globe to get to know the school before applying  tidmarsh says  still  she encourages everyone who can to visit kellogg in person   a campus visit really gives you the best sense of kellogg the best sense of how strong the faculty are  how energetic the student body is   she says   walking the halls is truly the best way to check for fit and environment and to see if this is a place you will be comfortable and excited about  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tidmarsh knows what it s like to apply to business school she herself applied to kellogg the first year the school accepted applications online  she says  but the application process has changed dramatically in the decade plus since then  she notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the biggest difference is how much applicants can learn about schools before applying   there is so much more information for people to preview and digest and consider as they are making choices   she says  for some applicants  this can prove less a blessing and more a curse   the pendulum can swing too far and people stop being themselves and start trying to repackage themselves as what they think the ideal business school candidate might look like   she says  to an admissions director  those kind of generic personas all begin to look alike  she cautions   i often say that candidates are best served by truly being themselves  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>step away from the application   my one piece of advice to applicants as they write their essays is to do some self reflection and soul searching  write a rough draft and then leave it for a while and come back to it later   says tidmarsh  too often  applicants shortchange themselves by rushing through the process   stepping away for a bit is a good way to approach the essay   she stresses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of business school overall  tidmarsh urges applicants to really do their homework  getting to know the schools  the size of their programs  their cultures and teaching methods   there is so much more to the business school experience applicants really shouldn t just look at the rankings  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of what tidmarsh is most excited about in the year ahead  it s welcoming the new kellogg class next month   when you have met these people virtually  watched their video essays  talked to them on the phone it is an exciting week when people come to campus for orientation and you meet them in the flesh   she says   of course  you barely have time to meet and greet and then it s time to start shaping next year s class  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our thanks to tidmarsh for making time to talk about kellogg s new essay questions and more </paragraph>

  <title>financing your mba  part i</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>getting into a top ranked mba program is no small feat  with application deadlines recently posted at several leading schools  many prospective applicants are laser focused now on preparing for the gmat  submitting undergraduate transcripts and crafting perfect essays  but every bit as critical as gaining acceptance to these top programs is figuring out how you ll manage financing your mba once you do </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you ve got a spare couple hundred thousand dollars in your bank account  then you can probably skip this series  for everyone else  read on  in this post and a handful to follow  we ll provide a broad overview of the various costs a typical mba student faces and the types of funding opportunities currently available  down the line  we ll take a closer look at the financial aid processes at a diverse range of leading business schools  giving you the tools you need to assess mba programs in light of both your own goals and available financing options </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re just beginning to think about an mba  this series can help map out the landscape  outlining the financial aid process and resources available at various programs  you can extend your research by consulting the clear admit school guides and schools  own websites  as well as through conversations with current students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for candidates farther along in the process  the series can help you plan out your application schedule with an eye toward financial aid deadlines and  if needed  any additional essays required  wherever you are in the process  we hope this resource can help you find the funding you need </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first things first  what s an mba going to cost  the first step in financing the mba is getting a handle on how much it will cost  the primary expense of an mba program is tuition  having said that  there are a variety of other costs including living expenses  course materials and additional fees that can increase the total amount a student pays by a half again  most business schools provide a breakdown of the expenses  which are posted under the financial aid or admissions section of their websites in order to help prospective students seriously consider the cost of completing a particular mba program  schools typically take the total cost of attendance into account when calculating the financial aid package students receive </paragraph>
    <paragraph>pre matriculation costs even applying to mba programs can be costly  to start with  taking the gmat even once will cost candidates       in addition  each business school typically charges an application processing fee  which range in price yet may total       candidates can also incur hundreds or even thousands of dollars in traveling expenses when visiting schools or going to interviews  finally  applicants can take on an array of optional costs such as gmat test preparation  consulting services and supplementary coursework </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tuition tuition at the top business programs has risen steadily for decades  indeed  in the past five years alone  the average tuition at the top programs increased by more than    percent double the inflation rate over that same time period  students can now expect to pay between         and         for a single year s tuition at a top school  with an average total price tag of          for tuition alone  public universities  which discount tuition for state residents  can sometimes be more affordable  for instance  in state residents attending schools such as uc berkley s haas  ut austin s mccombs  or unc s kenan flagler pay         to         less in tuition each year than do out of state residents  this wide range of variance can be explained in part by the different levels of subsidies that public universities receive and the economies of the states in which they are located </paragraph>
    <paragraph>living costs the cost of living also forms a substantial part of a student s expenses while at business school  these costs typically cover housing  food  utilities and other personal expenses  and they can vary widely by geographic region  for example  the fuqua school of business  located in the college town of durham  north carolina  estimates that students will pay         for room and board in their first year  meanwhile  at nyu stern  located in the center of manhattan in new york city  the estimated cost for room and board is         </paragraph>
    <paragraph>living costs are usually based on surveys of the student population or estimates of local rental costs  students should keep in mind that the figures posted by most schools are for single students with no dependents  those with partners or children should take into account the additional expenses of balancing family life with full time studies  harvard business school  for instance  estimates that students with a spouse or partner should set aside an additional         in yearly expenses for a spouse or partner  another         for one child and an additional        for a second child  meanwhile  tuck  with its rural new hampshire campus  calculates that        should be set aside for each additional family member  prospective students with further questions may contact their target programs  financial aid offices in order to request information about expected family expenses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>additional expenses and fees course materials  healthcare insurance  transportation costs and other mandatory university fees can add several thousand dollars to a student s expenses each year  furthermore  extracurricular activities  particularly international trips that are often a highlight of an mba experience  can substantially increase costs  for example  the kellogg worldwide experience and service trips  kwest  range from        to just over        before considering a number of out of pocket expenses  to help cover these expenses  some schools allow students to apply for an increase to their cost of attendance and thereby take on more loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>loan interest because recent legislature has rendered federally subsidized loans unavailable for u s  citizens or permanent residents in graduate school  students relying on loans to fund their studies will see their interest accumulate while in business school  for the most part  students do not have to start paying that interest  or the principle  until several months after they graduate  federal loans and some private loans also include an ordination fee that is tacked on to each loan disbursement  we ll go into greater detail on loans in a later post in this series </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to give you a sense of what you need to plan for  we ve compiled the following costs for sample applicant  sarah </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stay tuned for future posts in this series  where we ll take a closer look at the range of financing options available to mba students including school based financial aid  private scholarships and loan programs as well as specific resources for international students </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school case method video slated for makeover</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>if you ve looked at the new essay prompt for harvard business school  hbs  this year  you may have noticed that applicants are encouraged to view a video before starting to write  if you hadn t noticed  you re welcome </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs managing director of admissions and financial aid dee leopold is passionate about applicants watching this video  which brings to life the signature hbs case method   i am a nut about that   she confesses   if i could require that applicants watch it  i would  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the case method is so central to the mba at hbs that becoming as familiar with it as you can should be a central component to evaluating whether or not you could thrive at the school  leopold believes  because hbs understands that not every applicant will be able to visit campus and attend a class for him or herself  it features the aforementioned video on its website as a means of providing a taste of what the case method is all about </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the only problem  the video is from       although three of the four professors featured are still at hbs  much has changed in the in the eight years since the video was produced  for starters  the professor who teaches the actual case at the center of the video jan rivkin has risen from mere associate professor to become the bruce v  rauner professor of business administration and senior associate dean for research  david thomas  another of the professors featured  has moved on from hbs to become dean of georgetown s mcdonough school of business  the other two professors  janice hammond and david garvin  have also become named professors in their respective departments </paragraph>
    <paragraph>career progression  of course  is to be expected  still  the case at the center of the current video  bitter competition  the holland sweetner co  vs  nutrasweet  was written in       about a competition that ensued between nutrasweet and the holland sweetener co   hsc  following hsc s entry into the aspartame market in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perhaps even more concerning to leopold  though  are the clothes people are wearing in the case method video   i want a new video just to update the fashion   she says not once  but twice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  a huge part of the reason that hbs has gotten away with not overhauling the case method video before now is that the teaching style at its core hasn t changed  in a recent interview  professor frances frei referred to it as  a learning by advocacy  model  students pour over cases on their own and discuss them passionately in learning groups all before ever reaching the classroom  in class  they need to be prepared to have a position or recommendation and to defend it with facts </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we teach people the courage to act under uncertainty   professor garvin says in the video   it s not a passive process  and frankly  management is not a passive process   echoes professor rivkin   they get to try out many of the component processes of management in the classroom  and you can build muscles around things like judgment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you are asking people to learn how to take a stand   garvin adds  a fringe benefit  students seem to really enjoy it   fun is one of the most underrated aspects of the case method   rivkin says   learning shouldn t always be difficult  learning shouldn t be painful  there is this element of joy that comes with learning  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even so  the fashion is outdated  students are taking notes on legal pads instead of laptops  and there s nary an iphone in sight  well  leopold is getting her wish  the video is slated for overhaul  this year   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>part of the challenge  she notes  is choosing a new case that will stand the test of time while also proving accessible to a mass audience  if hbs has zeroed in on a recent case to spotlight in the new video  leopold wasn t giving it up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>whether you  apply this year and watch the case method video from      or next year  when a new video is slated to be available  leopold has a singular hope   i want prospective applicants to imagine themselves in this case study   she says   because hbs is truly a     percent case method learning environment  </paragraph>

  <title>a peek is all it takes  hbs s innovative initiative to woo women</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>for priyanka krishnamoorthy  a      mt  holyoke graduate working in investment banking at bank of america  a recent weekend at harvard business school  hbs  helped set her sights on pursuing an mba  the sri lankan native majored in economics and minored in math and had been thinking about business school for a while  she originally read about peek an innovative weekend program hbs debuted last month for students from women s colleges in an article in the paper  she decided to apply after attending an information session hbs held at neighboring smith college   they pitched it really well as a way to see what hbs is like   she recalls   on campus you hear a lot about phd programs and law school  but not about business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for krishnamoorthy  the highlight of the weekend was getting to meet current hbs students and alumnae and hearing about the decisions they made both before and after business school  just a few weeks into her own first job  she found their choices really eye opening   i thought there was a set path to it  but they all said   no  you can come from anywhere    she was encouraged multiple times throughout the weekend to think of the mba more as a master s in leadership than a master s in business administration </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an introduction to hbs s distinctive case method made her even more confident that she could thrive as part of the school s mba program   it s an active learning process rather than a passive learning process   she says   the case method really mirrors the environment of a small liberal arts college   the weekend also helped her overcome her apprehension about the steep tuition associated with an hbs mba   the cost is a huge factor and i wasn t sure it was worth it  but now i definitely think it would be  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>score one for hbs  only other participants would take far more convincing  take emily london  a    year old sophomore studying middle eastern studies at barnard college in new york city  her admittedly broad plans after graduation include doing something she loves that makes the world a better place and helps people  business school was nowhere on her radar  so much so that she deleted the emails she received about peek and disregarded fliers posted on the walls at school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but the program came up yet again when she was meeting with her career counselor at barnard   he has been working with me since my freshman fall and i trust that he knows me really well  but i was really surprised that he was suggesting this program for me   she says   i don t want to say that i reluctantly applied  but i apprehensively applied  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> thank goodness i got in   she says  the weekend at hbs placed business school squarely on a list of possibilities for the future   it went from  absolutely not   to  oh  i am definitely considering that   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why is harvard wooing women  hbs admits just    percent of the thousands of applicants who clamor for a spot in its class each year  making it among the most selective mba programs in the country  so why even bother trying to convince applicants who might be on the fence or  worse still  opposed  because  like most business schools  hbs is struggling to attract women who want to pursue an mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  after some recent gains  the latest application trends survey from the graduate management admission council reveals that the proportion of women applicants to full time  two year mba programs fell slightly in       to    percent  down from    percent the year before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to even approach the gender parity enjoyed more commonly by law and medical schools  business schools first have their work cut out for them in getting more women to simply apply  leading schools have placed significant emphasis on recruiting more female applicants in recent years  efforts that have helped schools like the haas school of business at uc berkeley enroll a record    percent women this past year and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school draw    percent women for its class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs  too  has made gains  the preliminary profile for the class of      shows that    percent of the incoming hbs class will be female  up from    percent in      and    percent in       still        is the goal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>can we get the case method to cook   youngme  felix and i have been working to create the conditions for students and faculty to thrive for several years   says frances x  frei  hbs professor of service management and senior associate dean for faculty planning and recruiting   i believe this specific idea was felix s  but we all jumped at the chance   she continues  felix oberholzer gee is faculty leader of peek and the current chair of hbs s mba program  youngme moon is a professor of business administration and the senior associate dean for strategy and innovation  together the three agreed to teach a series of case studies to peek participants  choosing cases they thought might appeal to the younger crowd  in the mix were four cases  on ikea  buzzfeed  chinese e commerce giant alibaba and tessei  a company that provides cleaning services for japan s bullet trains </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we were concerned we had never done anything like this before and i just really didn t know how it would turn out   says dee leopold  hbs managing director of mba admissions and financial aid  who apologized for being somewhat guarded about peek before it took place   we just didn t know  can we get the case method to really cook  really bubble in such a short time with people who haven t done it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  initial plans were to do a small pilot with just one women s college  barnard   we thought we might get    students   says leopold  but ultimately hbs opted to open the opportunity up to students at multiple women s colleges in the united states and abroad  when the weekend rolled around      students attended from    schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students payed      to take part  although financial assistance was available to applicants who could demonstrate need  and several participants shared that their individual colleges provided scholarships covering the costs  events unfolded the moment the women arrived on friday afternoon  june   th  with a campus tour followed immediately by a head first dive into their first case </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a lost little puppy  when i walked in on that first day i was a lost little puppy   recalls catherine cousins  who will enter her senior year at mills college in california next fall  cousins  who is double majoring in french and economics with an emphasis on international markets  learned about peek while studying abroad in senegal  she has always been interested in getting an mba but wasn t sure what it would involve </paragraph>
    <paragraph> when i first walked into the classroom at hbs  there were    of us and i was so intimidated   she says  noting that with only       students in the whole school  mills  classes are tiny  but being in a larger class proved revelatory for her   i was able to sit back and listen more and observe   she said   it really let me take in all the incredible and important perspectives in the room that i might not otherwise have considered  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>oberholzer gee kicked things off with a case study on alibaba on friday evening  perhaps recognizing that the students might be jittery just starting out  he led with an ice breaker   he asked us a few simple questions and had us write our answers on big pieces of paper and show them to the rest of the class   remembers london   it made me realize that there were lots of people there just like me  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the questions he posed were  on a scale of   to     how much do you know about business    what is your first impression of harvard business school   and  what is your hidden talent   hidden talents in the room ranged from tap dancing to netflix binging to being able to force a smile in any situation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>case method wins converts  i immediately fell in love with the case method it was a huge part of the great experience i had there   says cousins   i just assumed  based on my economics background that it would be really quant heavy  i was expecting numbers and statistics and excel  but the case method was so much more than just how the numbers change   she says  indeed  professors oberholzer gee  moon and frei led students through nuanced discussions of why and how companies succeeded or failed  what mistakes executives made and more   it was so refreshing to realize that business school  at least at hbs  isn t just about numbers and math   cousins says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cindy coffee  an architecture student going into her senior year at wellesley  felt wary heading into the first case as well   when we finished with it  i thought to myself   this is something i have been intimidated by  but it s not at all what i imagined it to be    remembers the ghanaian native   you are having a productive conversation with the professor and your cohort  trying to figure out what the company should do and eventually  at the end  what the company did do  it was eye opening to be taught in such an environment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold and the professors were just as wowed by the students as the students were by the case method   the women were really surprised by how they were really right in it from the start   leopold says   it was a very emotional feeling for us to see that   contrary to any concerns at the outset  the case method did most definitely cook and bubble despite the constraints of time  even with an audience completely unfamiliar with it   if it works for them  it will work for other populations as well   leopold notes  adding that potential audiences for similar programs could include college students studying stem  science  technology  engineering and math  or people from family businesses  for example </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beating business school students at their own game in one case in particular  the young women who participated in peek actually arrived at the optimal solution to the problem at hand faster than many of the business school students who have confronted the case before them  frei says she chose tessei because it s a case with a really hard problem turning around a very ailing system  essentially  workers had a very short period of time in which to clean the trains when they stopped in the station and they weren t being as productive as they needed to be   i hoped the students would have interesting solutions   frei says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the whole class came to the conclusion that it was important to empower the workers and romanticize their work kind of like a pit crew for racing cars  i think as a class we were pretty sure that was the right decision to make   london says   frances was absolutely in shock at how quickly we had come to that conclusion   she remembers   she kept calling it our faith in humanity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i was blown away by how engaged and thoughtful they were   frei says  in fact  she even tried to steer them away from their proposed solution initially   there are times when a student gets the right answer  but when pressed they back off of their conviction   we are a  learning by advocacy  model  and i wanted to see how strongly they would advocate their positions   when she s taught the case to more seasoned executives  they often propose firing all the workers right off the bat  or they ask for more resources or more time   it was as if this didn t occur to the students at peek   she says   instead they were most adamant about changing the culture changing the nobility of the job  which was to clean trains  and they felt they could do this quite quickly  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  that s just what tessei management did  and it resulted in an amazing turnaround for the company  london reports with evident pride </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dee leopold as dorm mother many anxious applicants to hbs view dee leopold as the school s formidable gatekeeper  but the impression peek participants got couldn t have been more the opposite  the women were split between three hbs dorms gallitin  hamilton and chase and leopold herself served as dorm mother of the latter </paragraph>
    <paragraph> dee is so kind and unassuming  when i learned that she headed admissions i didn t believe it   london says with a laugh    that s really you    she asked leopold incredulously </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i ve never had an experience like that before   leopold says  ostensibly  her role was to provide parental like oversight to this group of minors  although she added that she certainly didn t find herself breaking up parties or policing bad behavior   they all want to make a difference in the world and find something that has meaning for them   she shares </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the end of each day  they would return to the dorms  exchange their business casual garb for something more relaxed  and kick back   we were in these beautiful harvard rooms in comfy chairs it was a nice way to unwind and reflect after a long  long day   london recounts </paragraph>
    <paragraph> each evening we would debrief with dee about what she saw and how she saw us interact with the case method   recalls krishnamoorthy   on the first night she gave us guidance on how to be involved in the case method the next day when you should put your hand up  don t apologize   she says  over time  discussion moved into what hbs is like  what they are looking for  the things dee hates seeing in applicants  essays and different stories from applicants  interviews  she continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph> dee was very engaging and she wanted us to succeed  but she was also very no nonsense   krishnamoorthy says  adding that leopold told them that the weekend was for them to discover what hbs is like but that she wasn t trying to sell them on it   but she is clearly very invested in having more women apply  which i thought was very inspiring to see from a senior admission director   she continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the last night  leopold asked the young women why they d chosen a women s college   i answered  talking about why initially i was a little apprehensive about going to barnard but how i fell in love with it   says london   i couldn t believe the connection i made with her in just one weekend   she added  noting that leopold is also a barnard graduate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a skewed view of hbs  a case or two in  london found herself thinking   wow  this is amazing  i am sold   but she caught herself almost as quickly   of course i m sold  this is the barnard like environment that i am used to  a room full of really smart  powerful women with great ideas respecting each other  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>reality an hbs class where men still outnumber women by a significant margin will not be quite the same  the peek weekend participants each acknowledged that this topic had come up in conversation  a panel featuring alumnae included graduates from the early     s as well as some from just last year   they told different tales   says coffee </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there were many indicators that the culture is shifting  cousins echoed   it s a reality that the field isn t as diverse as we may want it to be  but the field is changing   she said   from talking to the students  it was very clear that times are changing  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> at points we did joke that we should have an mba only for women   krishnamoorthy said   but hbs is trying to mimic the real world  and that definitely includes men  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the value of diversity in the classroom  and especially with the case method  was not lost on these women  someone raised the point during one discussion that there is a limit to what you can learn sitting in a room filled with people who all think the same way </paragraph>
    <paragraph> they need the emily londons in the room  but they also need the people who fundamentally disagree with me on every level   the barnard student points out   i came to understand just how important that would be with the case method   she continues  being in a room with a bunch of people who see the world exactly the same way as you do is vastly different from being in a room with people who disagree   that not only creates a much more exciting and dynamic classroom setting  but it can also help you become better able to articulate what you mean  help develop your problem solving skills and either solidify what you already believe or open your mind to other ideas   london offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs seems to have hit a homerun with peek  at least to hear these participants and professors tell it  when asked  the only thing people said they might change would be to make it longer  most meant by a day or so  although longer breaks between sessions might be a good place to start   we were a lot of women   points out coffee  with just    minute breaks and more than     women there   there were serious lines for snacks and nearby washrooms  </paragraph>

  <title>fuqua admissions dean dishes on essays and life</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s not every admissions director who will make time during her vacation to discuss how prospective business school applicants should approach their essays  and yet liz riley hargrove  associate dean for admissions at duke university s fuqua school of business  did just that  speaking from north carolina s outer banks this morning  before the kids woke up ready to head to the beach  she shared insights with clear admit on the essay prompts released last week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not a lot has changed this year in terms of fuqua s application  it turns out  applicants will find they have twice as much space in which to answer three short answer prompts one on short term goals  one on long term goals and one on an alternative plan should that first short term goal not pan out  this year candidates get     characters for each response  up from     last year   we wanted to give candidates a little more opportunity to expand upon their responses   she says of this year s doubled answer field </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if the rest of the application looks pretty similar to last year s  that s because it is   we approach the admissions cycle really wanting to get to know our candidates   hargrove says   the essay questions we asked last year really helped us do that we really liked how we were able to engage applicants and glean information   she adds   absolutely  we are keeping them the same this year because they help us build a class that truly represents a microcosm of the world  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it doesn t hurt that applicants seem to really like the prompts too  she adds   the    random things  tweeting out their short  and long term goals they absolutely love it   she says  for her team to feel like they really get to know their applicants and for applicants to enjoy responding to the prompts is the epitome of a win win </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fuqua s     random things  as was the case last year  all applicants must reply to one required prompt and then select between two others  the required prompt      random things   invites applicants to share just that     quirky aspects of who they are  it grew out of a brainstorming session a few years ago when hargrove and her staff were trying to come up with an outside the box idea that would be in line with fuqua s entrepreneurial reputation  the prompt has been on the application ever since  in fact  hargrove likes it so much that she makes everyone who joins her own team share their own    random facts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she acknowledges that for as welcome as this unusual prompt may prove for many applicants  it may seem daunting to some others   we always worry about how the process appears culturally   she says   i think if you are on facebook and you tweet and you re on instagram it seems pretty natural but sometimes internationally it doesn t always translate   with this in mind  she and her team have shared their own random facts on the fuqua blog and elsewhere to give people an idea of how to respond </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here are a few of hargrove s own </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her team does worry some about how candidates feel about revealing personal things  but that s really what they are looking for   we want them to be a little bit vulnerable   she says   our objective is to admit people who will be impactful and really want to come to duke  and we find you can really get a sense of who people are and why they do what they do when they tell you about the quirky parts of their life  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when to opt for the optional essay like many other schools  fuqua does invite applicants to provide an optional third essay outlining any circumstances the admissions committee should be aware of  this is the perfect opportunity to explain a gap in work experience  a semester of lower grades in college  anything that might not appear consistent with the rest of your application   when someone uses this space to explain something that doesn t make sense to me  it s awesome   she says  for instance  learning that a family member got sick during your sophomore year in college can really help her team understand why your grades may have slipped then   but if it is a regurgitation of another essay or something a candidate has written for another school  it s just irritating   she cautions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an attempt to make things easier for both applicants and their recommenders  fuqua has taken steps to standardize its letters of recommendation some this year   we want to make it easier for people who are applying to multiple schools   she says   we get that  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most valuable letters of recommendation  though  are those that provide a good assessment of both a candidate s strengths and weaknesses   oftentimes  candidates think it has to be from the ceo of their company and say really good things about them but the best recommendation is the assessment of the good  the bad and the ugly   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to drive this point home  hargrove shares a few very personal things about herself  once  when her daughter was an infant  she burped her before heading off to work  where someone asked her what was on the back of her shirt   i went to work with baby vomit on my back   she says  more recently  in the past year  she has experienced several major losses and expanded her family to take in an orphaned nephew   i think about all of that and how it may have impacted me   what would someone write about me this past year    she wonders aloud </paragraph>
    <paragraph> perfection is not required   she says   in fact  the students who go into the job search process trying to be perfect are the ones who struggle the most  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>parting advice   my advice is always be yourself   hargrove says without a moment s hesitation   the thing i love about welcoming our incoming class is feeling like they have represented their most authentic self  individually and collectively  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she looks at her job as needing to build a microcosm of the world and to do that effectively she needs to get to know the applicants   the diversity of the incoming class is what makes the mba so transformative   she says   just be yourself  because everyone else is taken  </paragraph>

  <title>mba provides both immediate and lasting value  say graduates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>type  the mba is  into google  and the autocomplete box fills with inauspicious indicators of the degree s value   the mba is losing its magic  is followed by  the mba is worthless  and  why the mba is a waste of time and money   students graduating with an mba disagree and quite emphatically according to a survey report released today at the annual graduate management admission council  gmac  conference in denver </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business school graduates are clear in their judgment that their degrees not only provided immediate value  but lasting value   bob alig  gmac s executive vice president for school products  said in a statement announcing the results  indeed  nine out of    of the more than       graduating business school students who responded to the gmac global management education graduate survey  gmegs  rate the value of their degree as good to outstanding  and    percent would recommend their program to others considering a graduate business degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>graduates who snagged jobs early in the recruitment process were most likely to credit the degree with helping them develop skills in the areas of managing human capital  knowledge of general business functions and working well with others  gmac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>class of      graduates when surveyed in february and march of      felt overwhelmingly that the degree increased their employability  eighty six percent said the mba improved their chances of finding a job that meets their expectations  and    percent felt it both provided them with a competitive advantage and prepared them to meet challenges in the job market  the degree also introduced them to new career opportunities  said    percent of respondents </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what stands out in the gmegs survey  as well as in other surveys we have conducted over the years  is that a graduate management degree is an outstanding investment in the personal  professional  and financial aspirations of these students   alig added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it doesn t hurt that mbas are graduating into a great market  with early employment success reaching a three year high  according to survey respondents     percent of job seeking graduates from full time two year mba programs had a job offer in hand before graduation  up from    percent last year   salaries  too  are up  globally  mba grads with early job offers report a median    percent pay bump over their pre degree salary  that s up from    percent last year and    percent the year before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so why the disparity between what google suggests  the mba is  and what actual degree holders report  perhaps like the iphone s autocorrect function  google s autocomplete function still offers room for improvement </paragraph>

  <title>new certificate program at nyu stern lets working professionals sample the mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>not sure you re ready for a complete mba  why not try out a quarter of an mba  a program introduced earlier this year at new york university  nyu  stern school of business lets you do just that  the new advanced professional certificate  apc  program lets participants take five courses in either finance  marketing or general business taught by stern s world class faculty  alongside students in the school s part time mba program  upon completion of any of the three tracks  participants receive a certificate registered with the new york state department of education </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program is great for working professionals who want to quickly build knowledge in a specific area as well as for those who already have an mba but want to refresh or supplement their expertise  qualified candidates can apply for admission to the program and take courses on a part time basis in mba classes where there is capacity  enrolled students will have up to two years to complete the five courses  or    credits  required for certification in any of the three tracks </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one common theme we continue to hear with growing intensity from our prospective students  particularly millennials  is the importance of time how can i learn what i need to know as quickly as possible to excel in my current position or to be competitive for new functions   says nyu stern assistant dean of mba admissions isser gallogly   the apcs provide students with specific area knowledge fast and they are offered on weeknights and saturdays  making them accessible to working professionals  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the potential applications of this new program are vast  gallogly continues   for example  the finance track could quickly empower those who didn t major in finance in college  but who now work in the industry  with a broader perspective that helps them excel in their function   he says  the marketing track  meanwhile  might appeal to undergraduate liberal arts majors who are now looking to obtain marketing fundamentals along with the latest trends in analytics and digital marketing  and the general business track lets entrepreneurs pick and choose a handful of business courses that can help them get their ventures off the ground </paragraph>
    <paragraph>apc students can choose from evening or saturday classes on stern s manhattan campus or evening classes in westchester with students in stern s langone part time mba program  participants who don t already have an mba can also choose to apply to stern s langone part time mba program while pursuing their apc  provided they do so and are admitted before receiving their certificate  the can apply the apc credits toward the part time mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think it s a very cool and innovative offering   gallogly says  noting that it can be a perfect way to take a range of classes even if you don t have the time or money to do a full mba  it can also be a great opportunity for those who already have an mba  he says   maybe you were working in business and took time off to have a family   he offers   now you re ready to go back into the workforce and want to get up to speed this can be a perfect on ramp  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to ensure that all apc students can keep pace with the stern mba students they will be studying alongside  candidates for the apc program are required to have at least two years of work experience  go through a formal application process and submit either a gmat or gre score or proof of an mba degree  the first apc students will begin coursework in fall       and courses will be offered in the fall  spring and summer semesters  students may take a maximum of three classes  or nine credits  per semester </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is really nice to be able to provide different ways for people to get the world class education that nyu stern offers   gallogly says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>complete details are available here for the apc selection criteria and application components  view sample courses here </paragraph>

  <title>cornell s johnson school admission director shares excitement about forte conference</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>current mba students and alumni from leading schools around the country and the globe convened yesterday and today for the      forte foundation mba women s leadership conference  held this year at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  representatives from forte s sponsor schools are as important a part of the conference as the student attendees  admissions directors and others from forte s    sponsor schools attend in order to meet students  learn from speakers and network with sponsor companies  they also share their own challenges and triumphs as they relate to enhancing the experience of current and prospective female mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>judi byers  executive director of admissions and financial aid at the s c  johnson graduate school of management at cornell university  shared her excitement via twitter about attending this year s conference  clear admit caught up with byers  who joined the johnson school earlier this spring  to learn a little more about what she most hoped to gain from the event </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what part of the conference agenda caught your attention first  what are you most excited about </paragraph>
    <paragraph>judi byers  i m most excited to welcome our new students  it s incredibly fulfilling to meet the next group of women to pursue a cornell mba  and i m really pleased to be able to welcome them in person  forte does a great job of creating the environment for us to meet our high potential female applicants as they are preparing to apply to business school  and this conference is a way for us to support our new students as they get underway with their mba experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of the conference agenda  i m looking forward to sharing best case practices around student led diversity initiatives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  as an admissions director  what are you looking most to draw from the conference </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jb  i m looking forward to hearing about what schools  companies and organizations like forte are doing proactively to expand the pipeline of women who apply to business schools  we each have the opportunity and responsibility to help with increasing the representation and success of women in the workplace  particularly in positions of leadership  coming together to discuss ways for us to accomplish this is an important part of building awareness for those who are either planning to apply to business school at some point in the future or who perhaps have not yet considered the mba or field of business as a potential pathway </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what impact do you think some of what you hear and learn in the next two days could have on how you approach the upcoming admissions season at the johnson school  the following admissions season </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jb  i d like to hear more about the concerns and challenges that are top of mind for candidates  i m also looking forward to hearing about the initiatives that forte is working on to partner with schools to engage candidates even earlier on in the pipeline </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what role can the forte conference and events like it play in helping to increase the enrollment of female students at leading mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jb  forte continues to have an important and influential role in helping female students attend the world s top business schools  i think the forte conference and events like it provide an excellent venue to further the dialogue about the opportunities  support and resources available to women prior to  during and following an mba program  these events are one of the ways attention may be given to promote the benefits of pursing an mba as well as how candidates might leverage the experience to advance their careers </paragraph>

    <paragraph>last week s momentous supreme court ruling on marriage equality helped more people than ever before feel like the united states is a great place to be part of the lgbtq community  maybe it got you wondering about which business schools are the best places to be part of that community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as it turns out  there s a ranking for that  and this year  new york university  nyu  stern school of business soared to the top  winning recognition for getting more of its student body involved to help foster an lgbtq inclusive campus culture than any other top business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mba ally challenge rankings  released in june  are the culmination of a year long competition launched by nonprofit organization friendfactor as part of an effort to encourage straight people to become visible and active allies in their workplace and campus communities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>twenty three schools participated this year  shattering prior records  together  the business schools involved       students as allies more than double last year s participation of       and hosted more than     events and activities  collectively  the schools improved lgbtq inclusiveness on campuses by    percent based on measures taken at the beginning and again at the end of the school year  friendfactor reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the challenge  schools  efforts to activate their student bodies are ranked on three criteria  the number of students involved  the number of activities they execute and their results on a survey that measures lgbtq awareness and the inclusiveness of campus culture  to help make it clear that lgbtq students are welcome and supported on their campuses  participating schools have done everything from draping their student centers in rainbow flags to organizing inter section competitions to partnering with local lgbtq community groups </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nyu stern shot up from the number seven spot last year to outrank every other school  students at stern held    activities through the course of the year  including a comprehensive ally training series and a huge april ally week  the results were staggering  with    percent participation among the student body </paragraph>
    <paragraph> am i shocked that stern won the friendfactor challenge  no  i m not   says rachel hurnyak  mba       who served as president of lgbtq student group outclass   our community leaned into hard topics this year  there were awkward moments and sometimes misinformed things were said  but  as a community  we let it get messy  doing so allowed us to see what needed to be cleaned up  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to holding more events and establishing more allies than any other school  stern also instituted a gender neutral restroom on each floor of the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last year s winner  uc berkeley s haas school of business  slipped to number two this year  followed closely by the university of michigan s ross school of business  each had more than    activities and    percent student participation nothing to be ashamed of  usc s marshall school of business won for  most improved school   increasing inclusiveness by    percent over the course of the year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alison goggin  executive director of mba admissions at stern  shared that on hearing the news she joked with colleagues in admissions at haas that it is only fitting for stern and haas to hold the top spots  given the schools  respective locations in greenwich village and berkeley  birthplaces of the lgbtq civil rights movement in the     s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern is a program that has long made emotional quotient  eq  an integral part of its mba program   this year  several of us tried something new by injecting diversity and inclusion into stern s eq formula   hurnyak says  she and classmates asked the community to attend ally trainings and small group discussions  telling them the reasons would reveal themselves later </paragraph>
    <paragraph> later came sooner than we thought   she says  just a couple of weeks ago  when caitlyn jenner s vanity fair cover was revealed  a male investment banker and former classmate texted her to ask for clarity on a women s studies concept discussed in an ally training  meanwhile on facebook  another former classmate posted that caitlyn s gender identity is separate from her sexual orientation   i was overwhelmed with pride   says hurnyak </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the effects of stern s efforts to increase inclusiveness and haas s and ross s and every other school s will only ripple out    when these mbas enter the workforce  yes  they ll be able to stand up for injustices  but they will also know how to broach the topics that everyone else is too afraid to touch   hurnyak points out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>friendfactor  which calls itself  the lgbt rights organization for straight friends   praised participating schools  noting that    of the    achieved gold  silver or bronze status for reaching allyship participation levels and activity milestones  eleven schools reached gold marked by at least    percent student participation and more than nine activities  in addition to the three front runners  these schools include the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  uva s darden school  northwestern s kellogg school of management  columbia business school  duke s fuqua school  wake forest university school of business and unc s kenan flagler school </paragraph>

  <title>today s mobile generation wants business school admissions on the go</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>business schools that aren t meeting prospective applicants on their mobile devices and via social media may need to rethink their strategy and fast  this according to a recent survey measuring how today s mobile generation consumes media as part of the mba admissions process  results of the survey  conducted by southwark consulting and the graduate management admissions council  gmac   were released last week </paragraph>
    <paragraph> everyone has read stories and surveys about this newest generation shifting its media consumption habits   says southwark consultant alex brown  who co authored the study   the interesting thing about this study is that it is the first one to specifically target people applying to or considering business school   the survey s     respondents from around the world were all registered on mba com  the official website of the graduate management admissions test  gmat   which is the primary entrance exam for business school applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the results of the survey confirm what has been reported in the popular press that the rate of smartphone adoption among millennials is ubiquitous  between    and    percent  it also revealed social media s significant rise in importance as a place where this audience gathers its news  in broad terms  people have been looking to the internet at the expense of print  radio and tv for some time now  but the survey helped shine a spotlight on the newest phenomenon  which is that the current generation of business school applicants now learn things first on their phone not their pc and in their news feed  be it facebook  linkedin  twitter or some other social media platform </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business schools  on the whole  are laggards in their adoption of using these platforms effectively to communicate with their audiences   says brown  who worked in graduate management admissions for    years  including seven at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  before leaving to teach digital marketing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that the schools are lagging is par for the course  says brown  since there s always an element of catch up involved with technological shifts   there is no criticism here  but what business schools have been doing in terms of their mobile presence is a little bit behind the curve   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools  therefore  need to have a strategy that gets their content into those news feeds  since doing so makes that content more relevant and more likely to be seen by people using mobile devices  brown says  the importance of social media has only continued to rise  with more millennials finding their news there than on traditional news sites or via news aggregators  the survey found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an important way to reach female applicants the survey also found that millennial women spend more time on their mobile devices a day than their male counterparts  with    percent of female respondents using their smartphones three or more hours per day  compared with only    percent of males  and while men and women report using the various social media platforms at about equal rates  women are much more likely than men     percent versus    percent  to rank social media as their number one news source  according to the survey results </paragraph>
    <paragraph> having an equal gender mix has always been an issue at business schools  so one way to make sure you are reaching out to female populations is through mobile and social media   brown notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>linkedin trumps facebook as source for mba news when asked where they would like to receive graduate management news  more respondents endorsed linkedin than facebook     percent versus    percent   this finding was unsurprising  given that an mba is a professional degree and linkedin is a professional network  notes brown   what it tells us is that to the extent that schools have an effective linkedin strategy  they should be pushing it   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>segmented out by age  the findings of the study grew even more pronounced  younger respondents were more likely to spend long periods of time on mobile and social media and cited social as their first source of news at a higher rate   things are going to continue to move in this direction rapidly  and business schools need to have a proper mobile marketing strategy to remain relevant   brown says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what does that mobile strategy look like  should schools all rush out to develop their own apps to reside on the phones of this new generation of applicants  not necessarily  according to the survey  indeed     percent of respondents said they would download an mba admissions app from their target schools if it included features such as the ability to complete the application online  view where it is in the application cycle  receive admissions decisions and updates on events and communicate with alumni and current students   you have to be a pretty well branded school to make that leap of faith and spend the resources to design such an app   brown says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>complicating things even further  though the majority of respondents reported having more than    apps on their smartphones  they also revealed that they only use about eight of those apps on a daily basis  to become one of these eight habitually used apps presents a major challenge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a more realistic strategy for most business schools will be to make sure they have a very strong social media presence in the linkedin  facebook and twitter platforms that are among the habitually used apps  another important point of focus  as suggested by the survey results  should be on ensuring that a school s website is optimized for mobile access  since respondents report spending as much time accessing the internet via a mobile device as they do via a pc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while not without its challenges  the shifting media consumption habits of millennials present exciting opportunities for business schools   it s all new and ever evolving  but it does provide schools with a direct communications channel into the applicant pool   says brown  this is vastly different from times past  when admissions offices had to reach applicants by running ads in a magazine  for example   to now have the opportunity to move content out directly to applicants and engage in two way communication is very cool   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>view the complete  gmac southwark mobile social use survey  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>southwark consulting is led by graham richmond  an original co founder of clear admit  </paragraph>

  <title>forte foundation women s leadership conference draws record attendance</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>current female mba students and alumni have come out in droves this year for the      forte foundation mba women s leadership conference  taking place now at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  kicking off with a sponsors meeting on thursday for school and company representatives  followed by a career focused day of programming yesterday and a day centered around professional development today  the conference this year has welcomed     mba women and alumni  in addition to more than     speakers and presenters  for those who don t know forte  it is a nonprofit consortium of leading companies and top business schools devoted to launching women into successful business careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think we have pulled together some really interesting topics that a lot people want to hear about   says elissa sangster  forte foundation executive director  when asked what contributed to this year s record attendance   we are excited to see it all come together  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sangster remembers making name tags by hand for the    or so attendees that came to the inaugural forte conference    years ago  a lot has changed since then  her staff  which at that time consisted of herself and one other part time employee  has grown to    this year and will expand to    or    next year  she says  which is a good thing  since attendance has increased nine fold  participating schools have grown from    at most to    this year  and sponsor companies now number     sangster says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we had no idea the huge growth we would see   she says  thinking back to that first conference in        we had about          in the bank back then  and we have around    million now  so that is significant growth as well  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the number of forte fellows women receiving fellowships through the organization to pursue mbas at sponsor business schools has increased even more significantly  from fewer than    in the first two years to       today  to date  sponsor schools have given almost     million to forte fellows  according to the organization s website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with increasing coffers and rising demand  forte has vastly expanded programming for its annual conference  what initially amounted to half a day on friday and half a day on saturday has grown to two jam packed days of speakers  workshops  networking events and more  preceded by the sponsors meeting on thursday  sangster herself greeted attendees yesterday  followed by a welcome address from mcdonough school of business dean david a  thomas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with the theme  let s power up   this year s event boasts an incredible array of noteworthy speakers  as well as more than    workshops on topics ranging from money management to communications strategies to help make your voice heard in the classroom and beyond </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the keynote speakers are elana fine  managing director of the dingman center for entrepreneurship at the university of maryland smith school of business  and lucinda duncalfe  ceo of monetate  who will both discuss female entrepreneurship  cindy solomon  a customer service and employee engagement guru and strategic consultant to leading organizations including the mayo clinic  raytheon  oracle and google  will deliver another keynote address on how women can build confidence  power and potential </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  this year s conference also includes dialogue with leadership  a recurring component in which c suite women come together in candid conversation to share how they rose to the top  scheduled presenters for this session include jocelyn cunningham  market offering portfolio leader for deloitte  and gisel ruiz  executive vice president of walmart s international people division </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the conference has grown over the years  sangster and her team have divided content into elements that are primarily career focused on the first day and programming devoted to professional development on the second day  to appeal to the needs and interests of first year mbas and second years and alumni  respectively   everything on saturday has a professional development component  which makes it great for second year students  as well as alumni who may only be able to attend for one day   sangster says  the conference now also features a company expo  giving attendees the opportunity to engage directly with sponsor companies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sangster herself is most excited this year about today s closing session  a panel entitled mbas and the politics of doing good  which will include presenters laura walker  new york public radio president and ceo  jane mosbacher morris  founder and ceo of to the market  associate assistant deputy secretary of education ursula wright of the u s  department of education  and mary humphrey  ceo of the jane goodall institute   i think this is such an important topic for women especially   she says   we really want to help them connect the dots between the mba and doing amazing things that really have high impact  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of sangster s greatest personal goals and that of the forte foundation as a whole is to increase female enrollment at top mba programs   we are particularly proud of seeing the needle move it s grown from    percent in the top programs when we started in      to about    percent today   she says   it s a huge accomplishment and change  but it is still not enough  we want to see that average continue to move forward  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though the needle forte most wants to see move is female enrollment in top business schools  the mission of the organization is much broader   we don t spend all of our time focused on that because we need to focus on the pipeline   sangster says  beyond its work with current mba women and alumni  forte is also involved in a big initiative to engage with college students  ensuring that college women are exploring business no matter what their major is  a pilot  rising star  program will provide current college students with a curriculum they can follow to prepare for jobs after graduation that will ultimately help them become top applicants to mba programs  as part of the program  which forte is currently piloting with    institutions but hopes to expand  college women will get to engage with current forte fellows and women business leaders  get to know the forte website and resources there and be encouraged to explore leadership opportunities within student organizations on their campuses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the goal of the rising star program is not to encourage female college students to go straight to business school from college  since the schools and companies forte works with are not looking for that  it s really designed to help college women begin to think more about their possible future career paths so that they can make choices to support them  sangster says   if you have left undergrad and know you are going back to school later in your career  you are going to be more intentional about saving money  for example   she says   by reaching women in college and helping them with a plan  we hope to make it easier to get from there to applying  enrolling and paying for the mba  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another primary focus for forte is to serve as coaches and advocates for prospective female applicants to leading mba programs  the forte mbalaunch for women program includes group  one on one and peer coaching  office hours hosted by subject matter experts on every aspect of the mba admissions process and connections to current mba students at target schools   mbalaunch is really designed to walk them through the    months leading up to entering a top mba program   sangster says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though sangster is clearly always thinking about the big picture  we hope she s also gotten to focus on the moment and enjoy all that this year s conference has had to offer  the growth is impressive  and we ll be watching to see what she and her team at forte do next </paragraph>

  <title>a european mba  right for you </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with the dollar reaching a    year high against the euro earlier this spring  much ink has been spilled about how the time is right to head to europe for an mba  indeed  pursuing a graduate management education abroad can present a range of advantages for american students with cost savings chief among them  especially given the recent relative strength of the dollar  that said  the decision of whether or not to head to one of europe s top business schools is a highly personal one best made after careful consideration of many factors that extend well beyond any savings tied to currency rates </paragraph>
    <paragraph> oh yes  i definitely did benefit from the exchange rate   says alexander eldred  a washington  dc native currently completing his mba at france s hec paris  as luck would have it  eldred paid the bulk of hec s        euro tuition in march  right as the euro dipped to      to the dollar  had he paid the entire tuition then  it would have amounted to         for a degree that just a year earlier would have run him          add to that living expenses  which are similarly lower than they have been historically thanks to the exchange rate  and the savings stack up   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>shorter programs mean lower opportunity cost as happy as he was for the savings  eldred notes they were  really just a drop in the bucket  when you are talking about the cost of an mba  far more significant than any currency fluctuations is the shorter length of european mba programs  many of which range from    to    months  compared to the two year commitment far more common among u s  programs  this contributes not only to lower overall tuition costs  but also to markedly reduced opportunity costs  since students return to the workforce more quickly </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another north american student  meaghan kappel from toronto  chose hec in great part because of its    month program   the program length is perfect   she says  providing the ideal medium between north american two year programs and accelerated    month programs  which she ultimately decided felt too short   sixteen months gives you enough time to think  but you aren t losing too much of your salary and your professional experience  which was a big concern of mine coming into the program   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kirk bullock  a southern californian who decided to head to barcelona for his mba  was likewise drawn by a shorter program   a huge reason i chose esade was the flexibility of its program   he says  at esade  students can chose to complete the degree in        or    months  bullock began in september      and will finish in september      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> not only is the cost of the degree less  but it also puts you back into the workforce making a salary sooner   he says   to me  the two year programs just seemed too long too long to be out of the workforce  too long to be away from my network   he says  an additional advantage  he adds  was a more intense  focused experience   the networking that you do is much more intense  you make great friends and connections and you work them the entire time   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>diversity  diversity  diversity ask american students why they chose a european mba program  and you will undoubtedly hear diversity among their top responses   what is great about hec is how incredibly diverse it is   says eldred  ninety percent of hec s students are international  drawn from more than    different countries  this exposure to different cultures  languages  experiences and leadership styles is invaluable  including in the eyes of recruiters  he says   what a lot of firms are looking for is people who can play nicely in the sandbox   he notes  skills that naturally emerge from such diverse situations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> everyone touts diversity  but at a lot of places that are supposedly diverse  you have a majority student body and then you have the others   eldred continues   here  no one is even close to a majority the french only make up    percent   he continues   if you only talk to people from your own country  you won t have very many friends   he states matter of factly  since there are never more than four or five students in a single class from the same country   you are forced to get out and meet people from elsewhere and work with them   he says   hardly a day goes by when i don t speak four different languages  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bullock says the same about esade   if you go to berkeley and you sit in a class  diverse means you are still going to have at least    percent of people being american   he says  not so at european schools   we have maybe    percent spanish in our class   professors  too  come from all over the world  each tailoring courses toward their cultural preference  which further extends the diversity of experiences mba students encounter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kappel  too  touts the incredible value of the peer to peer learning that takes place in classes with such true diversity   every single class at hec involves at least one group assignment   she says  her very first group included one canadian  one indian  one japanese  one chinese and one moroccan  she recalls   when you are forced to work as a group and you all come from a different country  each of you leads in your way or  as importantly  learns when not to lead  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the role that language plays though the language of instruction at most leading european business schools is english  some americans choose european mbas to obtain or improve proficiency in another language  this was very much the case for jenna meulemans  a student at spain s iese business school  though meulemans studied spanish in junior high and high school and had worked and studied abroad  she was not fluent before moving to barcelona  at iese  she took part in an accelerated language course before classes began and has continued to seek out opportunities to strengthen her spanish with classmates and friends  because iese s campus is right in barcelona  day to day life provides plenty of opportunity to practice as well  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bullock  for his part  didn t speak a word of spanish and had never left the united states before heading to esade  but coming from a career in hospitality in southern california and hoping to ultimately return there  the opportunity to learn the language was a major factor in his decision of where to study   in my industry  spanish is a huge bonus  and it is such a prominent spoken language   he says  adding that language proficiency will open up possibilities for him not only in spain or returning to the west coast  but also in the majority of latin america  central america and other parts of the united states </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he has really focused on the language  taking classes provided through the school  working with private tutors and speaking with friends   my spanish is finally to the point where i have proficiency   he says  still  his hope upon graduation is to remain in barcelona and work in the hospitality industry  and for that he knows he still needs greater mastery  so he ll keep working on it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at hec  where students live and take classes on a campus outside of paris  it s not actually essential to master french  according to several students there  the language that everyone has in common is english  so much discussion both in class and outside of it defaults to that  having said that  you must speak french if you hope to work in france after graduating  says the quadrilingual eldred  who speaks english  french  german and chinese </paragraph>
    <paragraph> speaking french is really a prerequisite for having a fruitful career in france   he says  which is no different than in the united states  he points out   speaking the local language is normally a pre requisite for employment in most countries   formerly a spice trader in china and an ingredient buyer for mars in tennessee  eldred does intend to remain in france after graduating  targeting operations management jobs in paris in the food or transportation industries </paragraph>
    <paragraph>potential drawbacks of a european mba students who set their sights on working in europe after completing their mba should be aware that european salaries are generally lower than in the united states with the united kingdom  and london in particular  an exception  the degree costs less  but your earning power coming out  if you remain in france or spain for example  will also likely be lower </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the cost of living  though  is also lower   i will probably make less in barcelona than i would if i returned to the united states   concedes meulemans   but i have an incredible apartment here that costs a third of what i would have in new york  where it would be much smaller   she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bullock takes the same view   yes  the salary potential of going back to the states is much higher   he says   the cost of living in europe is lower  however  not enough to balance the equation equally  but it does help  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all of the americans interviewed for this story hope to remain in europe after graduation  though a couple indicated they may return to the states at a later date or as a back up plan  they each acknowledge that brand recognition for european schools among u s  employers could pose something of an obstacle to students hoping to return to the states immediately upon graduation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is a small disadvantage   says bullock   i do have to take the next step of explaining to an employer that esade is a top ranked school   he says   back in the states  if i say   berkeley   they know berkeley   but once the caliber of the school is established  he finds it s much less of a barrier than some people might perceive  the value of the brand within spain and in europe more generally  meanwhile  is enormous  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>eldred says much the same of hec paris   i think it is completely surmountable   he says   the hec name has enormous value in france here  people s jaws drop when you say you go to hec   outside of france  there is no question that the street value of the hec name is not as high as that of some u s  schools  he says  still  he s not concerned   the people who are hiring for the types of jobs you will want coming from hec will have heard of it   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the schools are also working actively to elevate their brand among u s  audiences and enhancing career services resources for students seeking work in the u s  after graduation  the current students say </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is starting to change   eldred says of hec s recognition outside of europe  things like the school s number one ranking among european schools in the economist this past year don t hurt  he points out  but he also attributes the shift to efforts by the school itself and to a greater number of north americans pursuing european mbas   it is an overnight process  no  but it is changing   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but make no mistake  living in another country is not always easy  the american students say   it can definitely be challenging   says bullock   adjusting to the culture is hard  especially for americans   he says of spain   things are much more relaxed here in terms of what we are used to  and there is much less convenience   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though she wouldn t trade her experience for anything  meulemans says that being so far from friends and family has sometimes been difficult   especially when you are doing something as intense as an mba   she says   it s not like being in new york  and getting to fly home to chicago for a weekend when you want to   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not right for everyone but for some  just right should the short term savings presented by currency fluctuations propel americans who ve never before considered getting an mba abroad to drop everything and start packing their bags  no  say most american students studying in europe right now </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but if you are a global citizen of the world or are ready and willing to work hard to become one the diverse classrooms  peer to peer learning opportunities  shorter programs and global networks presented by european business schools may be for you  if so  depending on where the dollar goes from here  you may save a little dough as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>still wondering whether a european mba might be right for you  the mba tour is hosting a conference in new york city on monday  june   nd  exclusively for applicants considering european mba programs  </paragraph>

  <title>georgetown mcdonough s shari hubert points to subtle changes in new application</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>refreshed following a two day staff retreat  the head of admissions at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business took time this morning to share with clear admit her advice to prospective candidates on how to approach the school s application for the class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though its essay question remains unchanged from last year  there are subtle shifts elsewhere in the application  says shari hubert  who has served as georgetown mcdonough s associate dean of mba admissions since       among other things  applicants will have greater opportunity to highlight experiences living and working abroad  read on to learn more about these subtle shifts  as well as hubert s advice on how to make taking a risk in response to the essay pay off </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if it aint broke  hubert and team decided to maintain last year s open ended  why you   essay prompt because they liked the insights it provided into applicants  backgrounds and motivations   it worked out really well for us last year allowing applicants to tell us their story in their own words   hubert says   what really stood out were those applicants who were willing to take a risk  be open and vulnerable  and tell us what they think and what is important to them   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>because the application features separate fields where candidates are asked to share their short  and long term goals  hubert and her team are looking more in response to the essay for applicants  rationale behind pursuing an mba  their philosophy on life and how they think mcdonough fits within it  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the line between taking a risk to be open and vulnerable and taking things too far is a fine one  as guidance  hubert reveals the risk she herself took when applying to harvard business school  asked to write about her greatest accomplishment  hubert shared that she had re established relations with her father  from whom she had been estranged for    years  when she was a junior in college   i opened myself up and took a real risk  but i was able to tie it back to my ability to take initiative  to be a leader  to not be afraid to take that risk   she says   if you are going to make yourself vulnerable and share something truly personal  you need to think about the end goal   she continues   how can you tie it into the values of our institution and illustrate how it makes you the type of student who would thrive here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcdonough s core values and just what are the values that mcdonough holds dear  you ask  one of the things that mcdonough prizes most as an institution is its global perspective and the global nature of its students  hubert says  true to its jesuit founders  the school also seeks students who will be women and men in service to others   of course  you come to business school to fulfill your own dreams and aspirations  but we also want students who are asking themselves what they can do to leave the institution better than it was before   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  georgetown is known for its collaboration  hubert adds   our students are continually thinking not only  will this help me succeed   but also  will it help my classmates succeed    she says  ultimately  this collaborative nature only reinforces the value of the brand  because if both succeed  it is better for the value of the degree  she notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  mcdonough again this year gives applicants the opportunity to submit optional essays to explain gaps in employment  provide information not otherwise included in their application or  for re applicants  show how they have strengthened their candidacy since their last application   for us  the optional essay is really key when we might have a concern about an element of a candidate s application this is an opportunity for them to proactively address that concern   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a few subtle shifts  even though its essay stayed the same this year  hubert draws attention to a couple of changes in the application that might be of interest  last year  the school had a broad question inquiring about applicants  global experiences whether they had ever volunteered  studied  worked or lived abroad  this year  hubert s team has broken this question into two parts to get a better sense  specifically  of applicants  global experience when it comes to working  living or traveling for business abroad  since this will have the greatest impact on their experience at mcdonough </paragraph>
    <paragraph>also new this year  the school will now offer an application fee waiver to individuals who are part of the forte mbalaunch program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>application volume growth mcdonough s application volume increased this past application season roughly    percent over the prior year  with the majority of the increase coming from domestic applicants   we were very pleased   hubert says  she attributes the growth to a range of factors  including a greater emphasis on digital marketing and public relations  as well as the school s partnership with customer journey mapping firm peer insight  which helped her team think about the application process from the applicants  perspective </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another shift hubert saw as part of the most recent application cycle was an increase in the number of applicants laser focused on scholarship opportunities   applicants are looking very closely at how they will fund and finance their mba  what the roi is  whether it is worth taking out loans   she says  it used to be that students didn t mind taking out loans for the mba  but with more and more applicants already having huge student loan debt  that is changing  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are getting more requests for scholarships and more appeals for scholarship reconsideration   she says  hubert has championed flexibility at the school in terms of being willing to accept requests for appeal  formalizing the process through which applicants can ask that their scholarship request be reconsidered </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fortunately  says hubert  mcdonough has also had an increase in its scholarship funding   that has been dean david thomas s number one priority to increase funding for mba scholarships   she says   that has helped us provide a bit more scholarship to more people who merit it  </paragraph>

  <title>mba applicants say fuqua  chicago booth get to know them best  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>applicants who applied to leading business schools in the         admissions cycle felt that duke s fuqua school of business and the university of chicago booth school of business got to know them better than others  according to survey results released today by the association of international graduate admissions consultants  aigac   notably  scores for how well schools got to know applicants fell this year over last for every school except chicago booth and more so at schools that reduced the number of essays applicants could reply to in the         application cycle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>aigac  which was co founded in      to set and promote high ethical standards and professional development among graduation admissions consultants  has been conducting an annual survey of mba applicants for the past six years  survey questions are designed to solicit feedback from applicants on everything from the tools they use to research programs to where and why they ultimately enroll to how they expect an mba will impact their future careers and salaries   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants select schools based on reputation  career impact aigac found this year  as in past years  surveys  that applicants are most influenced by a school s reputation when deciding where to apply  asked to allocate points out of     to each of    considerations  respondents allocated an average of    points to a school s reputation  more than any other category  career impact was second  at    points  followed by career placement stats at    and location  alumni network and school culture  which all received an average of   points each  less important to applicants were considerations such as academic focus  net cost of program  quality of faculty  global opportunities and program facilities  the survey found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the other interesting findings this year was growing interest by female applicants in entrepreneurship  compared to a slight decline among male applicants  this year  approximately    percent of both female and male applicants indicated an interest in entrepreneurship </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  consulting proved a main priority  with almost    percent of male and female candidates expressing an interest in working in that industry after finishing an mba  candidates continue to expect the mba to have a significant impact on their earnings potential  with both male and female respondents anticipating a roughly    percent salary increase within the first six months of graduating </paragraph>
    <paragraph>almost half     percent  of survey respondents indicated that they used admissions consultants as part of the application process  although male applicants were significantly more likely than female applicants     percent versus    percent  to do so  female applicants who did use admissions consultants were more likely to also pay for test prep support  the aigac survey found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the vast majority of applicants     percent  reported submitting gmat scores  although significantly more female applicants     percent  than male applicants    percent  submitted gre scores   of the female applicants who chose to take the gre  more than    percent cited the benefits of the test format and outcomes as their reason why </paragraph>
    <paragraph>aigac launches initiative to improve recommendation process last year     percent of applicants reported that one or more of their recommenders asked them to write letters of recommendation for themselves  many respondents felt that the recommendation process was onerous for recommenders and called for schools to adopt a shared  standard set of questions  aigac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this year  in response to some of these concerns  aigac has launched a new initiative to make the recommendation process easier to navigate  it has created an informational document explaining the letter or recommendation process  discussing what schools are hoping to read and offering tips on how applicants can guide recommenders in ways that are consistent with what schools have advised on their own websites  working drafts of this document are currently available on the aigac website in english  spanish  german  japanese and hindi  and mandarin  french and portuguese versions will be available soon </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the survey results reflected responses from     applicants gathered online between september      and april      </paragraph>

  <title>mccombs director of mba admissions weighs in on essays  application changes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin earlier this week posted its essay questions for the         application season  though the prompts remain largely the same as last year  mccombs director of mba admissions rodrigo malta had several interesting tidbits of news to share yesterday in an interview with clear admit </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we really  really  really love our first essay question   malta says of the prompt that invites applicants to introduce themselves to members of their future mccombs cohort   we have had it for three years now  so we had it way before harvard did   he adds with a satisfied chuckle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when the question debuted at mccombs the year before last  applicants were asked to reply in essay form  last year  mccombs offered greater flexibility  inviting applicants to choose between writing an essay  sharing a video introduction or sharing an about me profile   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>malta and his team loved the variety of responses that came in last year   about    percent of applicants submitted something other than a written essay  which far exceeded our expectations   he says  but his team really does not have a preference for one communication method over another   we want candidates to choose whichever communication method they think will allow them to put their best foot forward   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the team has seen some really wonderful examples of each communication method  as well as some really terrible ones   the terrible ones are usually those in which candidates try to do something they are not comfortable with or be something they are not   he warns  if you do choose to submit a video  don t feel like you need a full production studio  he adds  though they have seen great videos that are really well produced  they have also seen equally as effective videos that are really simple  just a one person show with the candidate speaking directly into the camera </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the second essay question  mccombs this year refined its prompt slightly in an effort to encourage applicants to focus their responses on what they hope to achieve while at mccombs  as well as why mccombs is right for them and what they will contribute to their classmates  experience  this is in contrast to last year  when applicants were asked to share what they hope to gain from the texas mba program both personally and professionally  in addition to why mccombs and impact on classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph> with just     words to reply  we realized that we were asking applicants to try to squeeze a lot in there   malta conceded   we want them to really focus on their time here at mccombs   he says of the slight shift  this is also the place to show some mccombs love  he underscores   we bleed burnt orange here in texas   he says   we want to make sure they know this is the right place for them and why  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  mccombs will continue to provide an optional essay where candidates can address anything that may not have been covered elsewhere in their application </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new emphasis on linkedin when the application goes live later this summer  candidates will notice some other changes this year as well  malta says  for starters  the application will place greater emphasis on candidates sharing their linkedin profiles  in the past  as part of the  getting to know you  section of the mccombs application  candidates were invited to share linkedin profiles  any blogs they have and even a pinterest page devoted to why texas mba  this year  those contributions are still welcome  but the invitation to share a linkedin profile has been moved up to right beside where applicants are asked to upload their resume </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants will also have a new option with regard to letters of recommendation  as in the past  recommenders will be able to submit official letters of recommendation directly to the school   this year  though  we will also be asking candidates if they want us to use a recommendation they have on their linkedin profile   malta says  exactly how this will work from an operational standpoint is still being ironed out  so stay tuned for precise details in the application instructions  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the motive behind this shift in terms of recommendation letters is two fold  malta shares   we want to have something that is useable for the applicant even after they go through the application process   he says  a recommendation via linkedin would have the added benefit of helping applicants strengthen their profiles in preparation for their career searches while at mccombs  but the public nature of a linkedin recommendation also stands to benefit the school  malta notes   anything that is out in the public gives us a little more assurance that it is going to be true  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking back at the past year  malta reports that he is very pleased with an increase in both applicant quality and quantity  applications were up between   and    percent  he says  with the majority of growth among domestic applicants  acknowledging that some admitted candidates have yet to decide where they will ultimately enroll  malta is cautiously optimistic about the quality of the incoming class   we know it is a really competitive environment out there  but initial indications are that we will be coming in with a great class profile   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the year ahead  mccombs hopes to build on recent success it has had integrating its first  and second year classes  this year  the school will expand initiatives designed to likewise increase interaction between students in the full time  part time and executive mba programs  orientation activities have been aligned across the different programs to provide greater opportunities for interaction  ways to connect the leadership from the various programs as part of the graduate business council are being considered and several of the school s international trips will be open to students from each of its different programs  malta says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>increased integration of the first  and second year classes  as well as of the students within the school s various mba programs  serves to strengthen the school s network and its reach   when we survey our applicants  we find that one of the biggest reasons they choose to come to texas is because of that longhorn network   says malta   so we are always looking for ways to make sure that those connections are there and alive and as far reaching as they can be  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our thanks to malta for taking time to share these updates with clear admit  stay tuned for our analysis of the mccombs essay questions  as well as further updates on recommendation letters and more when the application goes live later this summer </paragraph>

  <title>why mission matters at mit sloan school of management</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>how important is a business school s mission statement to the experience of its students  according to recent graduates of the massachusetts institute of technology  mit  sloan school of management  the school s mission to develop principled  innovative leaders who improve the world and to generate ideas that advance management practice influenced where they chose to attend business school  the experiences they had there and the future path of their careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ricky ashenfelter knew he wanted a school in a market that had a lot of entrepreneurial ventures  which led him to focus his search on san francisco and boston  but more than that  he also wanted a school that valued and would offer coursework tied to energy and sustainability  that narrowed his focus further to mit sloan  the university of california at berkeley s haas school of business and stanford graduate school of business  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what i liked most about sloan was that it was part of a larger mit ecosystem  which was not the case for many business schools   ashenfelter says  and so he left his consulting job at deloitte and headed for boston hoping to find solutions to the problems of food waste in business supply chains </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students drawn to sloan by its mission  the classmates i met from day one were all drawn to mit sloan because of its mission   ashenfelter says   many had motivations to pursue very international  large scale efforts that would change the world from a technology  sustainability or social standpoint  sloan naturally attracted students motivated by that   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to his delight  ashenfelter found that the school s emphasis on entrepreneurship and sustainability gave even more color and maturity to the thoughts and desires encapsulated in the mission  he says   the coursework and extracurricular activities at sloan encourage people to think big and beyond traditional jobs like consulting and finance   he says  of course  many sloanies do go into consulting and finance  he notes   but the time we spend at sloan embeds that kernel or idea around this mission that unifies us as we go out into the world  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before joining sloan  ashenfelter had been part of deloitte s sustainability and energy practice  working with retail and food companies to address challenges from an environmental perspective  having seen the issues of food waste in the supply chain first hand  he came to sloan hoping to explore solutions that he could then take back to a startup or existing business </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i did not necessarily come to sloan with a drive to start my own business   he says  and yet  that s just what happened  through the sloan entrepreneurship   innovation  e i  track  ashenfelter found himself bombarded with case studies  user stories and examples of entrepreneurship that quickly had him thinking he could and should launch his own startup </paragraph>
    <paragraph>together he and fellow sloanie emily malina launched spoiler alert  a mobile application and online platform enabling the real time exchange of surplus  expiring and spoiled food    i came focused on the ideas of food waste and sustainability and she came from the perspective of technology before school  we put our heads together to combine our past experiences to do something with a social and environmental mission that could also produce financial gain   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  malina and ashenfelter met before arriving on campus  at an event for admitted sloan students in the washington  dc  area  they would discover that they d worked just three floors apart from each other in deloitte s dc office  though their paths had never crossed  since ashenfelter worked in the private sector and malina worked in the public sector  doing consulting around technology implementation for government agencies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pair discovered a shared interest in technology and sustainability  and the idea for spoiler alert was born  at sloan  they took several classes together related to their fledgling business  both as part of the e i track and as part of the school s sustainability initiative  a certificate program designed to foster leadership around sustainability issues  these included a venture product marketing course taught by senior lecturer bill aulet  hubspot co founder brian halligan and kayak co founder paul english  as well as classes on technology sales and energy ventures  both also took advantage of the resources of the martin trust center for mit entrepreneurship </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to round out their individual interests  they took a range of courses separately as well and were involved in different extracurricular activities  ashenfelter notes  he was a member of the student led energy club and served as managing director of the mit clean energy prize  a student run business plan competition that distributes more than          to new ventures focused on addressing global energy problems  she was actively involved in the mit     k entrepreneurship competition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>simultaneously  the duo ran a pilot program for spoiler alert from january through march of this year  working with eight massachusetts based food organizations  including the greater boston food bank  as part of the pilot  close to       pounds of food were posted for donation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on friday  ashenfelter and malina both graduated from sloan as part of the class of       they plan to release the spoiler alert app beyond boston and start raising capital  remaining in cambridge to work on the venture full time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and so sloan s mission begins to ripple out into the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>spotlight on unconscious bias another sloan student graduating last friday was similarly impacted by the school s mission  though in very different ways  elena mendez escobar holds a phd in physics and worked at mckinsey for three years before coming to sloan  sponsored by her company   i chose sloan because the sloan alumni i have met were the kind of people i like to work with and had this incredible sense of collaboration   she says   i didn t realize the mission would be so important   she confesses   but so many students and professors here talk about the values and the mission of the school it really made me fall in love with mit sloan   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mendez escobar  a native of spain  transferred to mckinsey s boston office a year before coming to sloan because her physicist husband got a job at mit  she gave birth to her second child just months before enrolling in the mba program  one of the things she found herself thinking about most during her first year as an mba student was the lack of women in leadership positions in business  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i had it in my mind that i wanted to do something about that   she recalls  she remembers hearing an interview with lean in author sheryl sandberg  in which the facebook chief operating officer was asked what companies can do to increase women s leadership  sandberg talked about unconscious bias training   that spoke to me a lot   says mendez escobar  who began doing research around unconscious bias  discovering that it serves as an invisible barrier in developed countries where many of the structural barriers to diversity have been removed </paragraph>
    <paragraph> at sloan  where we have so many future business leaders  i had the thought that if we could have a conversation and really understand these subtle mechanisms and learn the tools necessary to remove these barriers  that could have a huge impact on future companies   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>breaking the mold conference sells out as co chair of the sloan women in management  swim  club  mendez escobar helped spearhead a series of events during the fall of      focused on unconscious bias  leading up to the annual swim conference in february       called breaking the mold  the conference was designed to help students understand what unconscious bias is and develop approaches to managing it in the business world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as an example of unconscious bias  mendez escobar points to research conducted by a recent visiting professor to sloan  modupe akinola  together with other experts in unconscious bias  akinola sent emails to more than       randomly selected professors at american universities  the emails  from fictional prospective students  were identical and written in flawless english  but they featured a range of male and female names  with varying ethnicities  the call back rate in response to these emails  however  was not identical  emails purportedly sent by white males  for instance  were much more likely to receive a response than those sent by asian females  the researchers found </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that is not something these professors were doing on purpose   notes mendez escobar   but there is something in the way we think that gives rise to those kinds of biases   she says  the good news is that recognizing this bias then suggests a very easy intervention to combat it where corporate hiring is concerned  namely having the first resume review be name blind  she points out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the hope with the breaking the mold conference was to draw attention to this type of unconscious bias and help attendees come up with strategies to combat it   when i started thinking about unconscious bias and how to tackle this problem  i never thought the initiative would get as big as it did   mendez escobar says  in all  the events she and swim co founder maria troein helped organize drew more than     people  the conference sold out two weeks before it started and  unprecedented for prior swim conferences  a full third of the attendees were male </paragraph>
    <paragraph>keynote speakers included former mcdonald s president jan fields and sloan alumna robin chase  zipcar founder and buzzcar founder and ceo  the conference also included an interactive workshop called  what policing can teach us about navigating unconscious bias   led by anna laszlo  director of the organization fair and impartial policing  the workshop invited participants to examine unconscious bias in high pressure situations and how to employ techniques to manage biases and the impact they can have on organizations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> maybe i can organize a seminar   i remember thinking   maybe i can organize a seminar    she says  she quickly learned that she could aim much higher  hoping for a team of    to    students to help organize the conference  she was amazed when more than    signed up   that s why we were able to do so many events  because there were so many people interested in it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>encouragement from the sloan administration and students pushed mendez escobar well beyond her initial goals   people kept giving me suggestions of people to reach out to at sloan and in the larger mit community   she says  it was at the urging of the school s administration that she pursued the idea of creating a mini documentary on the subject of unconscious bias  she notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i have never before experienced so much encouragement   she says   in the past  as a woman  i would have an idea and kill it myself before i even took it anywhere   she says  not so at sloan   i was surrounded by people giving me the encouragement to be confident in my own ideas   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one such situation arose when  having scheduled a meeting with the head of mit s department of women and gender studies to discuss how they might work together  she found herself being invited to teach a course on unconscious bias to undergraduates   at the beginning i was completely overwhelmed and said   no  i don t think i m the right person for this    but reminded by the sloan administration that she had plenty of teaching experience while doing her phd and that she had certainly developed an expertise in unconscious bias  she accepted the position   they pushed me to take an opportunity that maybe three years ago i would have refused   she says  it proved to be a wonderful experience  she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these experiences have made mendez escobar one of the biggest proponents of the sloan mission   thanks to sloan s mission  something that was a very small idea has become something very big   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as with ashenfelter and malina s ideas around sustainability and the supply chain  mendez escobar s ideas around unconscious bias are poised to ripple out from mit sloan  she has already been involved with the team at mckinsey that oversees hiring and promoting processes to discuss how they might implement best practices to avoid the unwanted consequences of unconscious bias  she hopes  upon returning to mckinsey  to do the same with the clients with whom she works </paragraph>
    <paragraph> part of why we started this was to help people in their companies after sloan   she says   everyone has a problem finding talent and diversity  and this is something that other companies beyond mckinsey will be interested in knowing more about   she says  especially as research shows that companies with more diverse leadership teams prove to be top financial performers  she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>down the line  she fully intends to stay involved with mit around issues of unconscious bias  if asked  she would gladly continue to teach a class to undergraduates  and she would also be open to developing a workshop with business school students on how to improve processes around hiring and promotion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>given that these mit sloan students represent just a small fraction of the more than     mbas who graduated on friday  imagine how far and in how many different directions the school s mission stands to ripple out from here </paragraph>
    <paragraph>find out how mit sloan s mission statement plays into this year s admissions process </paragraph>

  <title>nyu stern head of admissions offers advice on essays posted today</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>just after new york university  nyu  stern school of business posted its essay questions for the         admissions cycle this morning  assistant dean of mba admissions isser gallogly got on the phone with clear admit to share some advice on what the school is looking for in prospective applicants  responses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern didn t change much this year in terms of its essay prompts  the first  identical to last year  invites applicants to outline their professional aspirations  including why they are pursuing an mba now  what they have done to determine that stern is the best fit for them and what they see themselves doing professionally when they graduate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in answering this question  gallogly urges applicants to demonstrate a clear  well researched career plan as well as first hand knowledge of the stern mba   business school isn t a place to figure out what you want to do   he says   we all know it may change  but you need to come in with a plan   he underscores  he and his team are looking to learn from this essay whether applicants have researched the industries they are targeting or conducted informational interviews to learn as much as they can   we are looking for people who are directed and focused   gallogly says   they need to do their homework before they apply it s in their own best interests  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>likewise  applicants need to do their homework on what differentiates the stern mba program from others  gallogly advises  business school is a huge  irreversible investment          for stern tuition and registration fees alone  to be precise   you only go once  and you want to get it right   he says  noting that the choice you make extends well beyond the two years you ll spend there   this is going to be your network for the rest of your life  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> at a top tier school  it s not about avoiding going wrong because you are not going to go wrong  it s about how right can you go   he says  you want to choose the place where you will thrive  to get a feel for whether stern is that place  gallogly advises applicants to not only completely devour the school website  but also take advantage of the vast array of multimedia and social media resources  online chats and recruiting events around the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>best yet  come to new york   spend the time  spend the money  go visit the schools   he says  to not do so in his mind is like buying a car without taking it for a test drive  not only that  visiting a school provides a great opportunity to make your case about your admission directly to the admissions committee in person  he continues   why wouldn t you take that opportunity  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you advance to the interview round in the stern application process  you should definitely plan to come to campus  he adds  though the school does conduct limited offsite interviews in london  china and india  gallogly vastly prefers meeting candidates in new york   it is in candidates  best interests to come and make sure stern is where they want to be   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for its second essay instead of giving applicants a choice between two prompts stern this year served up just one </paragraph>
    <paragraph>personal expression  please describe yourself to your mba classmates  you may use almost any method to convey your message  e g  words  illustrations   feel free to be creative  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the admissions committee chose to move away from the second option  which last year asked applicants  to describe two different paths they could envision their career taking  because they found they got better insight from the personal expression option  feedback also suggested that applicants enjoyed responding to the personal expression prompt more   they feel it gives them the opportunity to convey who they are to the admissions committee in a more creative format   gallogly says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while stern doesn t track what percentage of applicants opt to submit written essays as compared to other forms of communication  it receives a wide range of submissions  gallogly reports   essays are totally fine   he stresses  noting that they receive plenty of those that are wonderful  but they also get videos  collages  recipe books  board games or cereal boxes that applicants have personalized  buildings  sculptures the list goes on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the fine print for the prompt does list some limitations  namely no food or articles of clothing that have been worn   back in the day  there was a classic story of someone who really enjoyed making sushi   gallogly recalls   by the time it showed up to us let s just say it really wasn t putting their best foot forward   over the years  stern has also needed to implement restrictions on size  he says  noting that there was a trend for a while where applicants seemed to be sending in the biggest thing they could think of   it was just a matter of time before a volkswagon showed up   he jokes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stern has featured this prompt for several years now because of the valuable insight it gives into emotional quotient  eq    columbia and harvard are now starting to follow suit in terms of this essay   gallogly notes  referring to the  introduce yourself  essay those schools have both introduced in recent years   we have had this a lot longer than they have  but i am glad that other schools are starting to pay attention to how important eq is   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>personal is good too personal  not so much we asked gallogly if there are common pitfalls applicants should try to avoid when sitting down to respond to stern s prompts   sometimes people take it into a space that is a little too casual   he says  while you are encouraged to share personal information  especially in response to the second prompt  make sure it is appropriate for a business setting  he advises  one litmus test is to consider whether what you are writing about is something you would feel comfortable sharing with your boss  if not  probably best to choose another topic   there are some conversations that should not be had on a cell phone on a crosstown bus   he says  and yet  it happens with every application cycle  he adds  don t be that applicant </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  stern again this year offers applicants the opportunity to submit a third optional essay  where they can explain current or past gaps in employment  plans to retake the gmat  gre and or toefl or other relevant information that may not be captured elsewhere in their application  notably  stern also requires applicants who are unable to submit a recommendation from their current supervisor to use essay   to explain why </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  there you have it  our thanks to gallogly for taking time to weigh in </paragraph>

  <title>new courses  boot camps keep kellogg mbas on the cutting edge</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>from the very latest in how to market consumer packaged goods  cpg  to the finer arts of persuasive data visualization  a new series of classes and boot camps at northwestern s kellogg school of management is giving mba students there the tools they need to stay current in the ever evolving world of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kicking things off last month  the kellogg marketing club partnered with cpg giant kraft to offer a day long boot camp designed for first year students preparing for summer gigs with cpg firms  kraft company leaders led the boot camp sessions  which covered topics ranging from channel relationships to nielsen ratings </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the purpose of the boot camp was to give first year students some exposure to concepts that they will encounter in their consumer packaged goods internships  but are not necessarily covered in the first year curriculum   says eric leininger  clinical associate professor of executive education  who directs kellogg s chief marketing officer program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a summer internship is the quickest way to spend    weeks i have ever encountered   said kellogg second year student and marketing club member matt benson  benson worked together with classmate dan rubin willis to help launch the initiative  so that interns could hit the ground running even faster   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to face to face interaction with kraft execs  the boot camp also included an impromptu session led by professor julie hennessy on the best ways to get feedback from a summer internship boss </paragraph>
    <paragraph>based on the success of this year s trial run  students in other industries may benefit from internship primers down the line   we plan to expand this idea to cover the tech and pharma industries next year   leininger said   crash course in consulting  complete with jet lag also new this past spring was an innovative course in which kellogg mba students partnered with students in spain and hong kong to get a taste of what it s really like to be a globetrotting consultant  as part of the new  international growth lab   kellogg students tackle real world problems facing an international business  working alongside students from esade business   law school in barcelona and the hong kong university of science and technology </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through a combination of regular video conferences and travel to work in person with their counterparts around the globe  participating students get to experience the jet setting rhythm of management consulting first hand </paragraph>
    <paragraph> they ll be real consultants  doing a real consulting project  making real recommendations to clients   said harold sirkin  who runs the lab  sirkin  an adjunct professor of strategy at kellogg  is also a senior partner and managing director at the boston consulting group in chicago </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more than just a pretty visualization also on offer for the first time this past spring  a new course entitled  visualization for persuasion  teaches students how to combine empirical evidence  cognitive science  computer science and graphic design to help sell ideas  taught by kellogg professor of leadership and organizational change brian uzzi and associate professor of psychology steven franconeri  the course helps students develop data visualization skills through hands on experience </paragraph>

  <title>fifa corruption scandal serves up ethics course material for mba students</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph> ethics and integrity are essential in the world of sport and are topics that have continued to gain importance for fifa and the football community in recent years   these words  spoken by former federation internationale de football  fifa  president joseph  sepp  blatter in august of last year  ring somewhat hollow today  at the time  the international governing body for soccer that he then led was preparing to host the first ever world summit on ethics in sports in belgium   we therefore welcome the opportunity to host this special summit and look forward to a fruitful debate among international experts on these important topics   blatter continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maybe he missed the conference  apparently  he either didn t listen to the international experts or he thought that what they had to say somehow didn t apply to his own organization  earlier this week  blatter announced that he would resign as president of fifa following the indictment by the united states government of several current and former fifa officials and sports marketing officials for bribery  fraud and money laundering </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as devastating as the unfolding scandal has proven for blatter and fifa s reputation  there are valuable lessons to be learned  and professors at several leading business schools fully expect to use the fifa case to teach their mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the case will certainly be written for an mba program   says b  sebastian reiche  an assistant professor in the department of managing people at iese business school  whose research focuses on cross cultural management and global leadership  among other topics </paragraph>
    <paragraph> many of the things that are playing out here could be a great case   echoes david mayer  associate professor of management and organization at the university of michigan s ross school of business  mayer  who is also faculty co director of the center for positive organizations at ross  notes that issues of cultural relativism  accountability and leadership in crisis that are central to the fifa scandal are all topics that come up in the classes he teaches on the intersection between ethics and leadership   now you ve got me thinking i should write a case on this   he says with a laugh </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the basic lesson for mbas is that corruption will cause organizations to implode   says harvard business school  hbs  professor of management practice william w  george   must practice integrity all over the world   the former medtronic chairman and ceo stated in a twitter exchange with clear admit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a combination of factors contributed to fifa corruption many factors came together in the fifa case  creating a scenario ripe for bad behavior  for starters  there are very high incentives for misconduct where international soccer is concerned  indeed  the    count indictment from the u s  attorney s office unsealed last week alleged that      million in bribes changed hands between fifa officials and other parties for vote rigging to send events to certain countries or business to certain companies </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there was a lot of money to be made and very little oversight   says mayer  add to that the fact that people in a competition mode who are high in power are more likely to engage in self interested behavior   i do think there was a bit of a perfect storm   mayer says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s possible that some of the fifa officials and others involved may have even rationalized to themselves that they were helping countries who might not otherwise have had a shot at hosting international events like the world cup  he suggests   i think oftentimes it is important for all people to feel like they are a good person in some way   he says  viewing what they are doing as some type of good could potentially have licensed the unethical acts in some minds  he offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the perception that bribery is part of the way business is done in certain regions of the world may also have something to do with how the corruption at fifa was justified by those involved and continued unchecked for as long as it did   believing that bribes are how business gets done other places is a form of morally disengaged thinking   mayer says  these kinds of rationalizations can and do affect people s behavior  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some areas of life  such as family  religion and education  are more likely to be imbued with morality  mayer notes  sports and business  in contrast  are characterized by competition   clearly people do wonderful things in both  but that combination can create a bad synergy that can lead to bad behavior   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bribery benefits no one cindy schipani  a professor of business law at ross for more than    years  takes a starker view   this scandal is just another example of the high level greed that s involved in trying to get business in a way that is completely inappropriate and benefits no on but the greedy parties   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most tragic  she adds  are the human costs  in the case of countries that may have paid bribes to host world cup events  for instance  millions of dollars were wasted that should have been spent on services for their own citizens </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there is never a benefit to paying a bribe   schipani says   you might get a contract in the immediate future  but the payments that go out are always much greater than the benefits that come in   she says  often  she adds  one bribe leads to another and another </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schipani  who has conducted extensive research on bribery and corruption  says that a western notion that bribery is part of how business gets done in other parts of the world is harmful   it s just not true   she says   bribery is illegal all over the world  when it takes place  it is always under the table  it is always hidden that tells you something right there  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lessons from fifa for mba students schipani hopes to drive home to her mba students that clean business is better business   what i worry about with my mbas is that they could go out into the world thinking   if i just pay this little extra then i ll get this contract and it will benefit the company  it will benefit the shareholders    in fact  the opposite is true  she says   it never benefits the shareholders  because bribery means that companies are spending money they shouldn t be spending  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the case of german engineering giant siemens  which was embroiled in a corruption scandal and paid a      billion fine for bribery in       the company is much more profitable today by operating clean  schipani says   it is just a fallacy in thinking that bribery is good for business or good for the company  it s not  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thinking that it is okay in other countries is another fallacy  she adds   i will dissect this particular scandal as it unfolds as another example of how corruption doesn t benefit business  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mayer  for his part  envisions using the fifa case as an opportunity to encourage his students to imagine ethical questions they themselves may encounter  doing so will probably involve presenting a range of conceivable scenarios  he says  for example  he could see himself saying to students   maybe no one in this room would take    million dollars in a bribe  but what might be something you would be tempted to do  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> put this way  i think my students could relate to the idea of feeling pressure   he says  be it feeling like they could lose their job if they didn t do something to win a given contract or be it feeling pressure to protect their family </paragraph>
    <paragraph>classroom discussion will also likely lead to the challenges an organization faces when there is an ethical scandal  mayer continues   how does an organization respond  can you keep the same leadership  does a leader have to go  what kinds of things can you do to renew faith  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fifa s future fate in the case of fifa  mayer and schipani both suspect the organization will rebound   they are going to take a hit  but i suspect that they will recover from it  especially if they make a commitment to seriously clean up  making sure that the parties that have touched this scandal in anyway are gone and putting in monitoring efforts to show that they are really cleaning up   says schipani </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mayer was not surprised to see blatter step down  but he was surprised at how quickly it happened  he suspects that the threat of corporate sponsors pulling out may have contributed   ousting blatter seemed like a necessary but not sufficient condition   he says   bringing in a leader who is removed from the scandal  who is untarnished and who has a reputation for high integrity will be really important now   he says  he also suspects that many more fifa officials may need to go </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  many of the factors that led to the corruption in the first place will remain   there will always be money and the incentives will always be high  but if there is more of an ethical culture and more oversight of the people involved  my intuition is that it will rebound   mayer says   ultimately the product is so good    he says   people love soccer  and they are motivated to want to get to see soccer and see institutions that support soccer on positive terms   he says   i really see them recovering  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>recent events certainly highlight the need for a world summit on ethics in sports  perhaps  though  an organization other than fifa would be better suited to host the second annual gathering </paragraph>

  <title>prince of wales challenges prospective  current business school students to champion sustainability</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>speaking last week at london business school  lbs   his royal highness  hrh  the prince of wales challenged current and future mba students to demand an education that will prepare them to lead the world toward greater sustainability </paragraph>
    <paragraph> to all those current business school students   and to those who are deciding where to study   ask yourself  is your chosen business school really going to equip you to be the kind of leader that is so badly needed for the next    years  nothing less will do   prince charles said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lbs hosted the may   th event  which was convened by the prince s accounting for sustainability project  a s  and the university of cambridge institute for sustainability leadership  cisl   speaking to an assembled audience that included deans and leading academics from business schools from around the world  hrh conceded that some progress has been made in the past two decades in terms of incorporating sustainability into mainstream accounting and finance research and teaching within business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for starters  he offered  the cisl that he himself founded    years ago has helped train almost       business leaders on how to find convergence between profitability and sustainability </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it is clear that new and important research is emerging from many quarters  including that relating directly to finance and accounting   he said   and it is good to hear that the m b a  programme has developed considerably to meet the widening demands and requirements of future business leaders   he added  but too often  he continued  specializations on sustainability are being offered as optional electives or as part of ethics classes  rather than being embedded into core curriculum courses </paragraph>
    <paragraph> is all this enough   the prince asked of those in attendance   and why on earth is it taking so long to get the message through  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools have a responsibility to tap the minds of their students and encourage innovation  creativity and greater understanding as it relates to sustainability  hrh challenged  the concepts of environmental limits and the enhancement of community capital should come up again and again in classes devoted to finance  accounting  marketing  corporate strategy and manufacturing  key words such as population  poverty  climate change  ecosystems and biodiversity  human rights  africa  mega cities  and the empowerment of women should appear regularly in lectures and academic publications  and up and coming academics should be rewarded for doing work related to ethics  sustainability and society  he argued </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in short  are your business schools really in touch with the issues that will increasingly have an impact on the future viability of businesses  or should wise and forward thinking companies be looking elsewhere to develop their executives for the future   he asked </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools have a very special role to play  the prince continued   society needs to be able to look to you with confidence for some of the best thinking and the most enlightened education  to secure the future for our children and our children s children  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lbs  for its part  is already on board  according to its dean   i very much support the call to incorporate sustainability in the business school agenda   dean sir andrew likierman said in a statement   indeed  the issues are already taught as part of the core curriculum in many of our programmes   as an example  he cited the school s business  government and society core course  in which students examine how businesses can best balance the drive to make profit with the needs of society </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is not only because we see their importance  but as a response to the keen interest of our students   likierman added  student interest in sustainability is also reflected in the rapid growth in recent years of the lbs net impact chapter  which presented its      society economy environment summit  s e e summit  the same day as prince charles s visit to the school  the student led energy club is also very active on campus  organizing events such as the annual global energy summit and clean tech challenge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for any of the strides lbs may be making within the classroom or as part of club activities  it would be foolhardy for it or any other business school to profess to have a solution to the sustainability challenges that face the world today  says ioannis ioannou  lbs assistant professor of strategy and entrepreneurship </paragraph>
    <paragraph> while there isn t a comprehensive set of best practices that business schools can confidently prescribe  what we can do is to be actively involved in an exciting series of experiments and active learning with the business community  and its stakeholders   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph> sustainability has to be discovered  the role of business education therefore  for now  isn t to teach best practice  it is rather to provide a structured understanding of the challenges  establish the parameters of possible solutions and accordingly drive curiosity  collaboration and adaptability  </paragraph>

  <title>big shoes to fill at dartmouth s tuck school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>one month from today  dartmouth s tuck school of business will officially welcome its new dean as professor matthew slaughter succeeds    year veteran of the post dean paul danos </paragraph>
    <paragraph>talk about big shoes to fill  dartmouth president phil hanlon called danos  everything any institution could want in a business school dean   and more than    alumni and friends contributed to a     million endowment to name the deanship in his honor  supporting in perpetuity all who come after him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a wide ranging interview published recently by the dartmouth office of public affairs  soon to be dean slaughter talks about what it s like to follow in danos s footsteps  what he thinks prepares him for the challenge and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>his life work to inform his role as dean an international economist  slaughter has spent years studying and teaching how globalization  technological change and public policy shape the performance of companies  industries and labor markets  these very same forces have likewise shaped graduate management education  he notes  as evidenced by the growing interest in business education in emerging markets  the ways technology is changing how ideas are delivered and the expanded scrutiny of education in the united states and elsewhere </paragraph>
    <paragraph> forces such as these make it a very exciting time for those of us in education   he says   the work i have done throughout my academic and professional career will hopefully inform the thinking and activities we do here at tuck   he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to his scholarship and tenure since      as a professor of management and associate dean for faculty at tuck  slaughter served on president george w  bush s council of economic advisors from      to      and has regularly worked with business and government leaders in washington on financial regulation  international trade  international tax and immigration   this experience has enriched my teaching  my research and all other aspects of my professional life at tuck   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a tough act to follow                                        as for succeeding dean danos  slaughter appreciates the enormity of the legacy he has inherited   paul transformed the tuck school from a very good institution to in aspiration and  in many ways  in actuality a world class institution   he says  danos increased the range and impact of the school s programs  centers and initiatives  grew the number of full time faculty from    to     and helped raise the school s standing in global rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>slaughter also appreciates his own good fortune in having danos as a leader   on a personal level  i will always be eternally indebted to paul for all the big and little things he taught me  in formal and informal ways first as a faculty member and then when i had the good fortune to serve with him in the dean s office   he says   excited to help foster values driven leadership in the wake of the financial crisis  the integrity of business leaders has been called into question  slaughter notes  more than anything else  he is excited to help create values driven leaders    at a time when so many are yearning for that rare kind of leadership  the chance to help lead tuck to address those needs is very exciting   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and he plans to dive in by talking to people throughout the institution  though he has been at tuck for years  he astutely recognizes that there is still lots he needs to learn about the school   research shows quite clearly that when ascending into new leadership positions  people tend to succeed more when they view learning as integral to their leadership  learning from and teaching to others to help create visions of where an organization can go  why it should go in that direction and the exciting gains that result from going there   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t fix what s not broken even as he researches and prepares for the ways in which tuck may need to change direction under his leadership  slaughter also recognizes enduring strengths that should not change  such as the school s commitment to quality  deep belief in the integrity of leaders and focus on experiential learning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>unparalleled teaching also sets tuck apart  he notes   part of what distinguishes us is the way we bring the knowledge creation of our faculty and the experience of our alumni into the classroom in a rigorous and relevant way   he says   we do a terrific job at tuck connecting the value of scholarship with the teaching endeavor  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on a lighter note  slaughter also shared that his fantasy is to be reincarnated as a successful pga golfer  not the mediocre golfer he is today  last but not least  he confessed that he is a family man   one other thing everyone should know is that as much as i love my work and love the tuck school  far and away the most important thing to me is my family   he says  his wife  two sons  two dogs and extended family matter more to him than anything else in the world </paragraph>

  <title>sustainability takes center stage at harvard business school commencement</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>forget crimson  the stoles and tassels worn by harvard business school  hbs  graduates today may have been deep red  but the school was going for green in its commencement exercises this year  as part of the day s events as well as those of class day yesterday and reunion tomorrow hbs graduates  alumni and guests will take part in a coordinated composting effort unlike any in the school s history </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the first time ever  the back to back celebrations this week at hbs will feature completely compostable lunch containers and utensils  which attendees will sort into designated bins for recycling  composting and trash  and because it can sometimes be hard to determine which items go into which bins especially for novice environmentalists hbs green team volunteers will staff each of the    sorting stations to help people know what s what </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the environmentally conscious measures culminate five months of hard work and logistical scheming by the hbs sustainability team  led by allison webster and leah ricci   the advanced planning we put in place has helped us get well ahead of the game   says webster  who works for harvard s office for sustainability  ofs  as the hbs sustainability program manager </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since joining hbs in november       webster has been helping reduce the school s impact on the environment through a range of sustainability efforts  she also oversees the mba student sustainability associates  ssa  program  which this year hired    first year hbs students to contribute to ongoing initiatives  complete sustainability focused independent projects and help educate fellow classmates on how to get involved in efforts to make the school greener </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ricci  assistant director of sustainability and energy management  joined the hbs sustainability team in september       reporting to the school s facilities director  she leads and administers the hbs sustainability program  with a focus on conserving energy  reducing waste  instituting best practices and educating the community on behavioral changes that can positively impact the environment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since january  the two have been leading the charge toward making this week s events more sustainable  coordinating not only with the student ssas  but also with the employee based green team  hbs operations staff  restaurant associates  and the mba and alumni   external relations offices  thirty two green team members volunteered their time to serve as guides at each of the waste sorting stations  covering    shifts throughout the day </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there are a lot of logistics behind the scenes that go into this   ricci explains in an interview with clear admit  indeed  it has involved everything from coordinating with restaurant associates  the group that caters hbs events  to source compostable containers and utensils to gaining buy in from the custodial team  which will need to collect an additional set of bins as a result of the sorting efforts   everyone has been really willing to work together to make this happen   webster adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>learning and educating along the way the week s successes are also the result of learning from prior events at hbs  as well as recognizing and incorporating best practices from other schools within the university and organizations outside of it  ricci snaps pictures of effective composting signage wherever she goes   i m always sending pictures to allison saying   look at this cool sign i saw    most recently  she spotted inspiration at a local hospital when visiting a friend </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the duo also takes notes from other harvard schools that have implemented composting practices  they learned from the harvard divinity school  for example  that there are advantages to lining up the bins in order of importance from left to right  compost  recycle  trash </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking back at last year s commencement exercises  they also realized that the successful introduction of composting this year hinged on having as many compostable containers and other materials as possible   last year  there were too many elements that were too confusing   ricci says  so she and restaurant associates worked together to track down compostable options  even managing to find ones that didn t drive up the cost   we worried there would be a big price increase  but at the end of the day it was a wash   ricci says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>water bottles were the only thing they weren t able to source in compostable form this year  in part because of supply chain issues  ricci devoted countless calls to trying to track down a solution  just in the past couple of weeks  they have identified a water filtration system that could be attached to a water source  enabling people to fill compostable cups from a fountain  unfortunately  that discovery came too late to be implemented this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that s our dream for next year   says webster  although she has even higher hopes for the future   if we could totally eliminate trash bins one day  that would be amazing   she says   to just have a compost bin and a recycling bin would be great  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>small changes contribute to big picture goals  when you look at it holistically  this is not just about us adding compost on commencement   ricci says   it really all ties back into a larger effort  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  harvard university has set a goal of reducing waste per capita by    percent by       from a      baseline   already  through a focus on operating healthier  more energy efficient buildings  hbs has reduced emissions on its campus by    percent and cut energy use by    percent  it has also implemented single stream recycling  composting in dining halls  reuse collection stations during move out and donation of leftover food to local shelters and food banks </paragraph>

  <title>columbia business school admissions director provides insight into         essays</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>columbia business school  cbs  kicked off the application cycle for the class of       sending its application live in late april  before any other leading business school  though this year s essay questions aren t hugely different from last year s  the school s admissions director took time to share her perspective on the subtle changes with clear admit and offer some guidance to applicants who may be preparing to embark upon the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>speaking to clear admit yesterday  admissions director amanda carlson turned first to the school s first essay prompt the  career goals why a columbia mba now  question </paragraph>
    <paragraph> through your resume and recommendations  we have a clear sense of your professional path to date  what are your career goals going forward  and how will the columbia mba help you achieve them  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like last year  applicants this year are given     words to map out their career goals and explain how a columbia mba fits into achieving them  a slight modification to the first sentence  though  suggests that applicants leave out any synopsis of their work history to date </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as carlson herself points out  her team has included a career goals why mba question or some variation thereof at least since she joined in      and likely longer  it s important enough to appear again and again not only because it gives the admissions committee useful insight into what the applicant hopes to get out of business school  but also because it forces candidates to really think about their goals long and hard before they arrive on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like sand in an hour glass depending on which program they enroll in cbs features an accelerated program that begins in january  as well as its regular full time mba students at columbia are in school for    to    months  in talking to prospective applicants  carlson likens that time to sand in an hourglass   as soon as you turn that hourglass over  your time is limited and it runs out really quickly   she cautions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>columbia s location in new york city and all of the extra opportunities that affords only amplifies the effect  this first essay prompt is designed to help make sure students are focused and can maximize all that business school in general  and columbia in particular  has to offer </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if students come and haven t narrowed what they want to focus on  they may miss many of the opportunities here at their fingertips   she says   we feel responsible and want to ensure that candidates are super prepared when they walk into uris hall  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>candidates considering a range of careers what if you re considering more than one potential career path   it is completely fair for candidates to say they may be exploring a few options   carlson says  the application actually provides two places for candidates to get at this answer  beginning with the short answer question that invites them to share their immediate post mba career goal   for this one we clearly want people to be concise and focused   carlson notes  indeed  since the form field will only allow submissions of    characters or fewer </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the career goals essay  in contrast  offers candidates a full     words to describe how their short  and long term goals fit together  and why columbia is uniquely suited to helping them achieve those goals   if someone wants to add a little bit of color and explanation  this is the place to do it   carlson says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in other words  you can hint at more than one potential career path  but to stay within the word count and tell a compelling story while also focusing enough in advance to make the most of your limited time at school you ll do well to narrow things down from the very start </paragraph>
    <paragraph> no one at graduation checks the admissions essay  of course  there will still be time to refine your chosen career path after application essays are a distant memory   no one at graduation checks the admissions essay to say   you said you would do x  y or z    carlson reassures   it s natural to be inspired by a professor  by your classmates  by the experiences you have in business school   she continues  that s part of the reason for going to business school  after all </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of its second essay  carlson and her team want to know how a candidate will take advantage of columbia s location  at the very center of business   more than that  they want candidates to provide examples of how they will seize the unique opportunities the school presents such as its master classes  internships  new york immersion seminars and access to world renowned faculty and practitioners to bridge theory and practice </paragraph>
    <paragraph>answering this question fully requires in depth knowledge of the school s unique offerings  so  what s the best way of obtaining this knowledge  is it through visiting campus  talking to current students  sitting in on a class </paragraph>
    <paragraph> all of the above  of course   carlson responds cheerfully  fortunately  she follows up with some specifics   we have a group of students called the hermes society who volunteer their time to speak with prospective applicants about columbia   she offers as a first step  noting that contact information is readily available on the cbs website   that s a great way to reach current students and learn what their experiences have been  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>also  since columbia s j term students take classes for    months straight beginning in january  class visits are available even during the summer months   we find that it s a really nice benefit for prospective students to have that opportunity over the summer   carlson says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for applicants who are specifically interested in learning more about the unique j term program  carlson and team will host a special event on july   th called  spotlight on january   as part of a robust day of programming  participants will learn just what the j term entails  as well as how it can be a really good choice for someone who is company sponsored  part of a family business or looking to make a slight change in their career  for example </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you can t visit acknowledging that some applicants simply can t make the trip to new york to visit the cbs campus in person  carlson s team has hosted dozens of webinars in the past year  some with an academic focus  others spotlighting leadership opportunities or other aspects of the school s community  she hopes for even more in the year ahead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lastly  the team is finalizing its summer and fall recruiting plans and will soon post dates and locations in the united states and internationally where prospective applicant can meet the admissions staff and learn more about the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> any and all of those ways would be really helpful in terms of helping folks learn a little more about what student life is like at columbia and how they can take advantage of  being at the very center of business    carlson says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> cbs matters   i am so excited to talk about this   carlson says of essay    this essay prompt builds on a question columbia has been asking for the past couple of years one that invites candidates to share something about themselves they think will be pleasantly surprising to their future clustermates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  an entire program has grown up around the very practice of cbs students sharing little known aspects of who they are with fellow cbs students  called cbs matters  the program was founded a few years ago by one of the school s alumni  and now it has become an institution in and of itself  carlson says  this year  the essay prompt includes a link to a video showcasing the program  in which current students share a story or stories about themselves with their fellow classmates  the program is voluntary  but most students choose to participate  says carlson  sharing their thoughts  aspects of their background  really whatever matters most to them  in a somewhat public forum   cbs matters presentations can be delivered to a student s cluster or to the entire school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this program has been incredible in helping students foster deeper relationships   carlson says   and when they get to learn about what really drives people what motivates them most very often classmates want to help   she says   cbs matters really creates bonds that last longer than just the two years students spend here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by interweaving the cbs matters program into the actual essay question this year  carlson and team hope to help prospective applicants move beyond a merely hypothetical question and envision themselves actually delivering their own cbs matters one day </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of what to choose  carlson encourages prospective applicants  if they want  to take this opportunity to share something personal that doesn t necessarily relate to their career goals  beyond that  to gauge the effectiveness of a topic you are considering  she suggests trying it out on two audiences  one person who knows you very well and one person who doesn t know you at all  if it speaks to them both  that s a good sign </paragraph>
    <paragraph>is imitation the highest form of flattery  we mentioned that there are some similarities between columbia s essay   and harvard business school s newest essay question  revealed earlier this month  in which applicants are invited to introduce themselves to the members of their future section  carlson was surprised to hear it and seemed quite sure that any overlap was unintentional  overlap  though  is not surprising  given that schools are looking for similar traits in candidates  she adds   at columbia  we ask this question because it is just such a great opportunity to get to know more about something that doesn t relate to the candidate s professional goals  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>parting advice  have fun with it   carlson says when asked for one last piece of advice she d give to candidates before sitting down to write their essays   i really encourage them to look at this as a  glass is half full  process in other words  we are looking for reasons to admit people  not the other way around  </paragraph>

  <title>star sternie recognized for helping promote inclusion and diversity within nyu s mba class </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>rachel hurnyak is proof positive that good things sometimes come in small packages  the petite  soft spoken president of nyu stern school of business lgbtq student group outclass was honored by dean peter henry at an awards ceremony last night for her leadership and contributions to the school s community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thanks to the efforts of hurnyak and other sternies  the new york city business school this year introduced numerous initiatives emphasizing diversity and inclusion part of the school s commitment to promoting  eq   emotional quotient  as an integral value within graduate management education </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i wanted to come to nyu stern because to me it represented the type of school that would be the best and brightest in terms of diversity and inclusion   hurnyak said in an early morning interview with clear admit yesterday before heading off to yankee stadium for nyu s school wide graduation ceremony   she did not yet know about the award she would receive later that night  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hurnyak  who identifies as a member of the lgbtq community  was less drawn by the school s proximity to wall street and its investment banks and more by its location within the village  where the lgbtq civil rights movement began in the     s  she says  when she arrived  though  she found that there was still room for improvement in terms of making the school a more diverse and inclusive place where everyone regardless of sexual orientation  race  class or gender could feel safe and supported </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rather than waiting for something to happen organically or one person leading the charge for change  several groups including outclass  the association of hispanic and black business students and stern women in business worked collaboratively to champion greater diversity and inclusion school wide  hurnyak says   together  we succeeded at getting stern to a much better place  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>expanding allyship to all as an example  stern this year expanded  allyship  a concept promoted within the lgbtq community of inviting straight peers to serve as allies to lgbtq community members to be inclusive of all community members  a first among business schools  as part of ally week in april  a full    percent of the student body signed the ally pledge  promising to serve as allies to one another </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the ally pledge historically has been lgbtq specific   says hurnyak   we changed it so that it includes all people and calls for a promise to respect everyone  making stern a safe space for everyone  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one of my favorite moments as a human  current events and a forum called  stern speaks   in which stern mba students share their life stories with their classmates  also helped unite the student body for path changing discussions  hurnyak says  in the wake of the michael brown and eric garner cases that rocked the country      stern students gathered on a thursday night in december to hear three of their african american classmates speak </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another stern student  in a blog entry for the financial times in january  recounted the event   those of us who attended had the privilege of hearing three brave classmates share their stories  all of which included personal encounters with both individual and institutional racism   wrote victoria michelotti   when the floor opened to the audience  people mustered the courage to ask uncomfortable questions  honest and sometimes painful answers were given in reply  a dialogue had begun  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that discussion which was moderated by nyu stern professor dolly chugh  an expert on unconscious bias is when stern students really put everything on the table   it was the first time organically our community said   we are at a fork in the road and we have to choose between discussing the difficult topic and avoiding it   hurnyak recalls   it is one of my favorite moments as a human   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dean s recognition last night  dean henry presented hurnyak with her award at the academic awards and service recognition reception  the prestigious service award was established by stern alumni to recognize a graduating mba with extraordinary service and contribution to the school and the university as a whole  hurnyak s classmates chose her as the recipient </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today  during his convocation remarks at stern s graduation ceremony  henry addressed the assembled graduates about leadership and community at stern including the school s emphasis on eq  he noted with pride initiatives such as stern speaks  the cross collaboration of different clubs to strengthen the stern community during ally week and the    percent student participation in the ally pledge  he also again praised hurnyak s contributions to helping the stern community become more inclusive and diverse </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hurnyak  for her part  seems more comfortable talking about what stern has given her than what she has given stern   i often find in the lgbtq community that lesbians and gay men forget that we need to be allies to our bisexual colleagues and our transgender colleagues   she says   the diversity trainings that we received this year will help me be a better ally to members of my own community  which sometimes people are shocked to hear is necessary   as part of ally week  a gender neutral restroom was instituted and opened on each floor of the stern school  going well beyond a student initiated request for a single restroom in the building </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her time at stern has clearly also made hurnyak a greater ally to classmates outside of the lgbtq community   now i am ready to dive into racial equality issues   she says  even amid triumphs with regard to marriage equality  recent events in baltimore have made it impossible to ignore enduring racial inequality  she says   this year really taught me personally that these issues are not exclusive of one another they all relate to one another   she says   progress in the lgbtq community feels great  but i still can t celebrate fully when we are taking steps backward nationally with regard to race or gender  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hurnyak s growth and that of her classmates bodes well for business in general  she suggests   the single greatest achievement during my time at stern has been helping our peers practice talking about difficult topics topics surrounding race and gender and transgender issues  sexuality  socioeconomic status   she says   to me that is an achievement because these sternies will take those skills with them to their workplaces and their internships  and that will have a ripple effect for the rest of their careers  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as these sternies head out into the world  they will be able to leverage the kind of mindset that stern helped them embrace   as they make their business decisions  as they engage with their employees they will make their companies more inclusive and diverse places  which will positively benefit those businesses and society as a whole   she says   i call that a  win win   </paragraph>

    <paragraph>students graduating in recent days from mba programs across the united states and around the globe have more to celebrate than simply turning tassels  results from a corporate recruiters  survey released today show  indeed  employer demand for recent business school graduates tops all previous years  according to the      corporate recruiters survey  conducted by the graduate management admissions council  gmac  in partnership with efmd and the mba career services   employer alliance  mba csea  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an astounding    percent of u s  employers surveyed report plans to hire mba grads this year  up    percent over last year  globally  numbers are also robust  if not quite as strong as the u s  figures  some    percent of employers worldwide expect to add new mbas to their workforce this year  up from    percent in      and just    percent in       this bests the prior all time high of    percent in        </paragraph>

    <paragraph>during her tenure  she helped launch a capital campaign that has raised more than      million  including increasing donations by    percent each year  she noted in her email  she also cited the role she played in helping to strengthen the faculty and doctoral program and in increasing the school s global footprint  according to the school s website  she helped hire    tenure track faculty members and    lecturers  representing a full    percent of the current teaching faculty at the school  she is also credited with increasing international learning opportunities for students by    percent and for forming    new partnerships with universities around the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i am proud of the work we have done together to secure the ross school s position as one of the best business schools in the world   she wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her decision to announce her departure a full year before stepping down is both to give the school ample time to identify a successor and to not jeopardize the ongoing capital campaign  she says   it is very difficult to look  prospective  donors in the eye and ask them to invest in the university and you when you have one foot out the door   she told the financial times   this is much fairer  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>davis blake will leave ross once her term expires on june          </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school aims to become  go to place  on gender issues</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  wants to help the world understand gender related matters as never before so today it launched a brand new gender initiative designed to promote gender equity in the business world and society as a whole </paragraph>
    <paragraph> harvard business school and its faculty have been leaders in defining the roles and functions of business  as well as effective business practice   dean nitin nohria said in a statement   with the launch of this initiative  we want to have a similar and lasting impact on the way the world understands and acts upon gender related matters  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs senior associate dean for culture and community robin ely will lead the new initiative  which will have as its main goal to provide rigorous research to ground discussions about gender  helping people make better informed decisions as they relate to themselves  their families  their companies and their communities  she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>case in point  research released friday by hbs professor kathleen mcginn providing evidence of advantages for children of working mothers  mcginn  together with mayra ruiz castro  a researcher at hbs  and elizabeth long lingo of mt  holyoke college  studied        adults in    countries  they found that in    out of    countries studied  the daughters of working mothers completed more years of education  had higher rates of employment and were more likely both to supervise others and earn higher incomes than those of moms who stayed at home  sons of working moms  while their careers were not measurably impacted  were found to contribute more time each week to childcare and housework which research has shown to increase women s involvement in the workforce and perhaps impact the stability of marriages </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there are very few things  that we know of  that have such a clear effect on gender inequality as being raised by a working mother   mcginn said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the study was conducted as part of the new gender initiative  its findings help counter still prevalent perceptions that the increase in working moms is bad for society   a times article friday cited a pew research study in which    percent of adults had that view  compared to only    percent who saw more working moms as a positive   this is precisely the role hbs hopes the new initiative and its research will play </paragraph>
    <paragraph> so much of what people think they know about gender is simply not substantiated by empirical evidence but instead is based on gender stereotypes   ely said in a statement   we want to develop the initiative so that harvard business school becomes the  go to place  on gender issues  where both researchers and practitioners can come together to find ways to advance gender equity in the workplace and help both women and men lead whole  fulfilled and sustainable lives  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to supporting such research and related case studies  course development and conferences the gender initiative s mission includes spotlighting the intersection between gender and other axes of inequality and expanding women s opportunities to lead and  challenge discrimination  stereotypes  implicit biases and power disparities  that limit both men s and women s ability to thrive   according to a press release </paragraph>
    <paragraph>further  hbs hopes to support collaboration among hbs faculty and other scholars and practitioners interested in issues of gender and to cultivate a community of business leaders who are committed to advancing women and promoting gender equity </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nohria  appointed in      by drew gilpin faust  harvard s first ever female president  has pledged since joining the business school to help redefine gender relations on campus  in september       a front page new york times article outlined efforts he had led for the prior two years to foster greater success among its female mba students through changes to the school s curriculum  rules and social rituals  in january       nohria promised to increase the number of female protagonists in hbs case studies from   to    percent by      </paragraph>

  <title>cfa credentials complement the mba  do not substitute for it</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an applied finance and economics professor at johns hopkins university who  guarantees  the undergrads who take his class their top choice jobs on wall street when they graduate advises those students to skip the mba and obtain their chartered financial analyst  cfa  credentials instead  at clear admit  we re crying foul </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hopkins professor james hanke  in an interview with business insider  said he doesn t think that mba programs are worthwhile  cfa credentials  he argued  are  more rigorous  and  much better  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hanke has been trading currencies and commodities for more than    years and runs his own wealth management firm  still  we think his comparison of a specialized technical certification with a broader education in all things management is absurd </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the cfa is basically a test of finance and accounting with a focus on how finance and accounting is used in the banking industry   clear admit co founder eliot ingram says   meaning  the cfa is really only relevant for people seeking certain jobs in the finance industry   the mba  in contrast  offers a broader business education as well as a valuable brand and network </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make no mistake  the cfa has value  a lot of mbas in finance take the exam because it is a good credential to have in finance  ingram notes   it does demonstrate a level of mastery of the material much like passing the bar exam after law school   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>having said that  prospective applicants to business schools should understand how admissions offices at leading mba programs view cfa and certified public accountant  cpa  credentials  these credentials are not considered  academic  measures like an applicant s gmat or gpa  says ingram   in reality  the completion of the cfa cpa exams is more of a professional credential and is not a substitute for grades and standardized testing   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while we are happy for hanke s students who have landed entry level analyst positions on wall street  we stand by our belief in the intrinsic value of the mba and caution those who would heed hanke s advice and mistakenly believe that cfa credentials provide an adequate substitute for the broad based management education provided by leading business schools </paragraph>

  <title>wharton commencement speaker to share how the mba could save his life</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>david fajgenbaum  md  msc  has been working toward his mba as if his life depends on it  because it does  on sunday  in his commencement address to his classmates at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  he will share just why he believes a graduate management education can be the difference between life and death </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fajgenbaum was diagnosed with idiopathic multicentric castleman disease  imcd  in       a rare and poorly understood hematologic disorder in which the immune system becomes activated and causes cells to release inflammatory proteins that ultimately shut down the body s organs  at the time of his diagnosis  he was in his third year of medical school at the university of pennsylvania s perelman school of medicine  he took a year s leave and underwent aggressive chemotherapy  which initially was unsuccessful  over a six month period  he was hospitalized for four and a half months and even read his last rites  but ultimately the chemo helped put the disease into remission  and fajgenbaum returned to complete his md  he then proceeded straight into the mba program at wharton </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prior to his diagnosis  fajgenbaum had no intention of pursuing an mba  but his disease  combined with research he conducted in medical school  convinced him that he could do nothing else   there was no choice   he says matter of factly   i viewed what i would learn in my coursework at wharton as the information i needed to keep myself alive  to solve this disease  and to extend my life  i needed this training to take this disease down  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why you need a business degree to battle deadly diseases when he returned to medical school after his diagnosis  fajgenbaum dove headfirst into researching his own deadly disease  which has a    percent five year survival rate  he made some dramatic breakthroughs  in an article published recently in the journal blood he turns much of what had previously been understood about the disease on its head  suggesting a new concept of imcd pathogenesis and presenting a new sub classification system </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but he also encountered major roadblocks  biomedical research  he found  was plagued by a lack of overarching strategy  limited collaboration  and inefficient use of funds  perhaps even more damaging  limited resources like tissue samples weren t distributed in ways best geared toward finding a cure  too often  says fajgenbaum  experts in a given field keep all of the tissue samples to themselves  without access to samples  other researchers are shut out from the process  unable to contribute to eradicating rare diseases </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in       he co founded the castleman disease collaborative network  cdcn  to help accelerate research and treatments  still  he knew he needed the training an mba would offer to keep moving forward  especially given that he was already conducting research on penn s campus  wharton was the obvious choice for business school   there is nowhere else i would rather have been   he says   it was a no brainer  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  guided in great part by the training he has received at wharton  fajgenbaum and the cdcn are trying to democratize research by collecting tissue samples directly from patients and distributing them to researchers more strategically  to this end  he has developed a brand new model for building patient registries  one that allows patients to enroll themselves but grant permission to a team of healthcare professionals to verify the medical information  this hybrid model combines the high quality of physician powered registries with the affordability and greater reach of registries powered by patients </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he has also connected all the physicians and researchers in the world who are interested in castleman disease there are     in his network and then crowdsourced among this community to determine what research should be conducted first  finally  he has helped encourage and facilitate collaboration with pharmaceutical companies  all with the goal of accelerating the path toward a cure </paragraph>
    <paragraph> when you are dealing with research and deadly diseases  there are serious downsides to not coming up with a solution   he says   you should be willing to try anything  everything has to be on the table  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton s community rallies around fajgenbaum s fight the support and community fajgenbaum encountered at wharton has astounded him   i came to business school expecting that i would be able to gain the skills that i needed to take down castleman disease   says fajgenbaum   what i didn t count on was the wharton community getting behind me the way it did  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>twenty fellow students have given as much as    hours a week of their time to be part of the cdcn s leadership team  the help this team has provided from working with a researcher at columbia university to obtain tissue samples to creating marketing materials has been invaluable </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i never imagined there would be this significant group of wharton students who would make this their passion  too   he says  he calculates the roi of his mba in terms different than those of many other business school students  the way he sees it  he has gotten at least a    fold return on the two years he devoted to business school in terms of the time and energy his colleagues and classmates have given to serve on the team and be part of the fight </paragraph>
    <paragraph>laser focus could result in a blueprint for all rare diseases also while at wharton  fajgenbaum worked together with some of his classmates to develop a business plan for how the cdcn s approach to eradicating castleman disease might scale to combat other rare diseases  the venture  coined cure accelerator  was a semi finalist in the wharton business plan competition  bpc  and won the bpc social impact award </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the time being  though  scaling to combat other rare diseases will have to wait   if i didn t have castleman disease and we weren t on the edge of so many breakthroughs  i would pursue that with everything   fajgenbaum says  but for now  he simply doesn t have the bandwidth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>message for fellow business school graduates fajgenbaum suffered a third relapse while at wharton  requiring a third debilitating round of seven chemo agents administered over a three week cycle  but not only will he graduate on time with his class on sunday  he was selected by a committee of his classmates to deliver the student commencement address </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what does he plan to say  first  he wants to remind his fellow graduates that there are countless problems outside the traditional mba industries that a business school education can help solve   your mba puts you in a position to transform and overcome hurdles in any industry   he says  not just investment banking or consulting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second  you can have impact even if you re not a subject matter expert  business school graduates who know nothing about medicine can still be instrumental in driving research forward  by offering innovative strategies for motivating researchers or novel means of incentivizing collaboration  for example   you can change and transform industries based on the unique resources you have developed here   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last but not least  he will remind his class that it takes an army to make change   we would have made one percent of the progress and breakthroughs we have made if it were me doing it by myself   he underscores  turn to your classmates  your colleagues they will be there to support you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on to his dream job as his classmates toss their mortarboards skyward and head off to their post mba jobs  fajgenbaum will continue on his mission to find a cure for the disease that still threatens his life  he has just accepted a full time research position at penn s medical school that will allow him to spend    percent of his time researching castleman disease   it s a dream come true   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even though he is returning to medicine and research  he has every intention of turning to fellow wharton graduates and future business school students for help and insights   we desperately need smart business students to come up with solutions to these complex biomedical problems   he says   not enough people are applying business strategies to biomedical problems   he laments   it s a bunch of mds and phds doing the best they can  but when we can get smart mds and phds in the same room as smart mbas that s when we can really come up with ideas that will change the world  </paragraph>

  <title>mothers at booth prove that being a mom  getting an mba can go hand in hand</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>what s harder than juggling the frenetic pace of classes  clubs  recruiting and studying that fills the two years of an mba program at a top tier school like the university of chicago booth school of business  doing it as a single mom  and yet  there are moms who do just that  and do it well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sofia vargas and natalie wilson are co chairs of mothers at booth  a student club whose name says it all  vargas      has a three year old daughter named gabriela  natalie      has a five year old daughter gabrielle  the two gabbys play together often as their moms hit the books </paragraph>
    <paragraph> booth was one of the only schools i looked at that had a specific group geared toward mothers   says wilson  when she asked about resources for parents at other schools  she was referred to partners  clubs and while undoubtedly valuable to their members  she found that these groups usually served the female partners of men who were working toward their mbas   it is a very different experience when it s the mom who is going to school   wilson notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  especially when it s the mom who is also raising a child on her own  as is the case for both wilson and vargas   i just really loved that booth saw the difference  and saw the value in having a group specifically for moms   says wilson </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as co chairs of mothers at booth  vargas and wilson are working to plan a series of events  including a mother s day brunch later this month   they opted not to schedule it on mother s day  but a week later  recognizing that moms would probably want to spend the actual day with their families  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>they are also hoping to draw successful booth alumnae who are moms back to campus to share their experiences balancing family life and work  another forum they hope to host will focus on hr issues of particular concern to moms paid medical leave  whether or not an employer offers a place for breastfeeding mothers to pump  the difference in healthcare costs for individuals versus families   there is just so much i didn t know before having my daughter that i didn t factor into the equation of what kind of salary i would need   wilson says  events like these are designed to serve not only students who are currently moms  but also those who hope to become moms in the future </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to co chairing mothers at booth  wilson also co chairs two other student groups  net impact and the african american mba association  aambaa   and interns part time at a private equity firm in the suburbs outside of chicago  vargas  for her part  is the co founder of two companies  one a chain of organic grocery stores in mexico  and the other  a nonprofit that provides early childhood education to children in the slums of india </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so just how do they juggle classes and coursework  club and other extracurricular commitments  recruiting and being a mom   you have to be very organized   says vargas  a typical day involves waking around   a m  to shower and dress before waking her daughter  leaving the house by   to drop her off at daycare  arriving at school by   to prepare for      a m  classes  squeezing a couple of meetings and or calls into her lunch break and more class from      until      or study on the afternoons when she doesn t have class  at      she leaves campus to pick up her daughter  feed her dinner  play together  bathe her and put her to bed before cramming in another four hours or so of study  at the very end of the day  around midnight  she ll sometimes watch an episode of homeland  if she has the energy   my classmates know that i am unavailable from   to   in the evenings  and on the weekends i don t work   she says   that works for them and the rest of time i am super efficient  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wilson s day is much the same  she fits in some early morning study time before waking her daughter to get her ready for school  she stays on campus most days from   to      going from class to group meetings  and a terrific babysitter two evenings a week allows her to take one evening class and have another night devoted to study  but in the other evening hours and weekends that she spends with her daughter  she tries to stay unplugged and really focus on having quality time together  and she stays up late  often until two or three in the morning  doing more work after gabrielle has gone to sleep   my friends just call me  nocturnal nat    she says  she acknowledges that she probably doesn t get quite as much sleep as she needs  but there will be time for that later  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>both moms credit the extremely flexible curriculum at booth for making it possible to be mba students and single moms at the same time   i love it  because you can pick whatever you want to take   says vargas   i can t take evening classes between   and    but the curriculum is varied and often the same classes are offered both in the morning and the evening   wilson  who was an undergrad business student at wharton  was also drawn to the fact that she wouldn t have to spend time retaking core business classes that she d already completed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>understanding classmates has been another key factor in allowing both women to thrive at booth   the thing that has surprised me most is how much some of my classmates really want to get to know my daughter   says wilson  she frequently brings her gabby to campus events on friday afternoons  where she runs around and has a great time   there are some classmates who know her better than they know me   wilson says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i was really apprehensive about how flexible some people would be or how understanding they would be of my experience   wilson remembers  instead  teammates will often propose doing a google hangout in the evenings rather than a group meeting  recognizing that it s easier for her  she says  or they ll all head to her apartment  where they can study together while her daughter sleeps </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for vargas  one of the most challenging aspects of her time at business school so far has also proven one of the most rewarding   i think the hardest thing  especially at the beginning  was to be clear with my group mates that my daughter was my greatest priority without making it sound like a limitation   she says  but over time she has learned how to do exactly that </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it has been so rewarding to realize that i have the right to put some limits and prioritize my life and my time with my daughter   she says  prior to business school  she worked as a consultant for mckinsey  where she intends to return when she graduates   before when i was working  it was hard to balance my two lives at work and at home with my daughter  in my mba it has been very surprising how welcoming people have been to the idea and how understanding they have been  i realize now that i can organize my life better and set clear limits  and people will respect them  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>both moms concede that they may not be having the same business school experience that some of their classmates without children or families are   there are limitations on my social life   vargas says   if i wanted to go out more i would go out more  but i don t think i am in the same state of mind as some of my fellow classmates  i m ok with that  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>without someone she can leave her daughter with for a weekend or a week away  wilson has missed out on some of the opportunities for travel that her fellow classmates have had  but she s okay with that  too   i might not walk away from here having been to    different countries  but i will have the connections and career development i need  </paragraph>

  <title>stanford gsb  wharton  cbs post class of      admissions deadlines</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>deadlines  essays and word count  oh my  the class of      application season is officially in full swing with multiple schools including stanford graduate school of business  gsb   the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and columbia school of business revealing details about the requirements applicants will face </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gsb shared this week on its website that its round   deadline for the         application cycle will be september   nd  nine days earlier than last year  applicants who apply in the first round will receive decisions on december  th  the school s round   deadline will be january   th  with a decision notification date of march   th  round   s deadline will be april  th  and applicants in that final round will hear back from the school on may   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of essay questions  there will be no change this year from last  applicants will get to share just a little more about themselves  though  because the school has increased word count from a total of       last year to       this year  the admissions committee suggests allocating     words to essay a   what matters most to you and why    and     to essay b   why stanford    but allows that applicants can choose to divvy up the word count in other ways if they feel it would prove more effective  according to the website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of when to apply  stanford advises sooner   if you plan to apply in round one or two  we strongly encourage you to apply in round one   reads its website   over the last few years  the number of applications we receive in round two has increased  making it more competitive  do not rush your application  but submitting it earlier is better  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton also shared deadline information this week  although it has yet to reveal its essay questions  in term of deadlines  round   applicants will need to hit submit by september   th this application season  a couple of days earlier than last year  the decision release day for this earliest round will be december   th  round   s deadline will be january  th  with decisions going out on march   th  and round   s deadline will be march   th  with final decisions going out on may  rd </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as from stanford  the advice from wharton is to apply early if possible   we strongly encourage you to apply in round   or     reads its website   the first two rounds have no significant difference in the level of rigor  the third round is more competitive  as we will have already selected a good portion of the class  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cbs  meanwhile  announced that the deadline for both its accelerated january term  in which students forego a summer internship and study for    straight months beginning in january  and its binding early decision round will be october  th  the regular decision deadline will be april   th  with its rolling admissions process  cbs delivers decisions to applicants based on when they apply those who apply sooner hear sooner </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for its essays  cbs will keep things largely the same as last year  the first essay invites applicants to share in     words or less why  given their background  they are pursuing an mba from cbs now  the second gives applicants     words in which to explain how they will take advantage of being  at the very center of business   and the final required essay  which also has a maximum word count of      gives applicants a chance to reveal something they think might come as a pleasant surprise to their future cluster mates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  harvard business school  hbs  got the ball rolling last week  sharing that its round   deadline will be september  th  its essay questions will be posted on may   th and its official application will go live in mid june </paragraph>

  <title>university of illinois college of business launches new         mooc based mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the university of illinois college of business this week announced the launch of an online only mba degree program designed to democratize access to graduate management education  according to u  of i  college of business dean larry debrock  called the imba  it will be the first complete online graduate business degree offered in partnership with silicon valley educational technology company coursera  which offers courses from many other leading mba programs through its platform of massive open online courses  moocs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the college of business is celebrating its    th anniversary this year  and development of this new program was designed to mark the occasion  according to debrock   we re entering the online mba field motivated in part to find new ways to return to the tradition of great public universities making an elite education available to all   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with a price tag of just          the program is radically less expensive than online mba programs offered by leading business schools like carnegie mellon s tepper school of business and unc s kenan flagler business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the u  of i  college of business is not as highly ranked as the other schools offering more expensive online degrees  and the imba will not feature in person components like tepper s part time online hybrid program  which includes six weekends on the cmu campus over the course of the program  or mba unc  kenan flagler s online program  which features quarterly global immersions bringing participating students together for group sessions in cities around the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nonetheless  imba courses are all taught by college of business professors  and each specialization has an optional additional component  offered through the illinois edu web platform  that includes discussion with classmates and instructor feedback  and the ability to obtain an mba for less than the cost of a single year s tuition at many undergraduate colleges from a school ranked among the top    in the world is noteworthy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program also puts a new spin on the traditional mba curriculum  featuring what the school has dubbed  stackable credentials   stand alone specializations in subjects such as corporate finance  strategy  marketing and social responsibility that together build toward the full mba degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph> rather than simply transferring traditional mba content online  we re mixing academic disciplines into active learning packages about how businesses work that are preassembled for students   raj echambadi  associate dean of outreach and engagement at the college of business  said in a statement  each specialization is self contained and designed to equip students to apply what they ve learned in a given subject area immediately in a real life business setting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as with most moocs  any of the imba program s courses can actually be taken for free on coursera  to obtain a certificate of completion  participants pay      and to obtain college credit they pay        per course or        per specialization  they can apply for the official imba program before they start or after they have completed any or all of the individual courses or specialization </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this means that current professionals can sign up for classes in topics they need for work and later stack together individual certificates to construct a complete degree   this is part of what makes stackability possible   each sequence brings together all the pieces of the puzzle in one place   said echambadi </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the stackable nature of the program gives students the flexibility to take courses in whatever sequence they want  a full degree requires completion of    courses  which students who take two courses at a time can do in two years  but they also have the option of stretching the courses out over as many as five years  in this way  the imba program  reimagines graduate education to be more flexible and accessible   daphne koller  co founder and president of coursera  said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that students can complete coursework before even applying to the degree program is also a radical departure from traditional business school admissions  make no mistake  official enrolment in the imba program does require applying and being admitted  but  success in specializations in the program will be considered as a factor in admission   according to the program s website </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the imba really leverages the power of moocs for the first time   debrock said   the first portion of every course is open enrollment and involves people from all over the world  not just those who have applied and been accepted into an online mba program  instructors lead through a cohort system that creates constant  direct interaction among peers  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>elsewhere around the country and the world  business school students are likewise putting their money where their mouths are  still others are pitching in with person power and organizing know how  helping bring much needed relief to a nation devastated by a     magnitude earthquake feared to have affected some   million people or more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>april chapman  who pledged to match funds raised by the students in said s diploma in strategy and innovation program  said that social media posts and emails began to fly as soon as the news broke  and her cohort immediately decided that raising an immediate financial gift would be the best way to make a difference  chapman serves as co chair of the world vision innovation fund  a faith based humanitarian development and relief organization serving the poor in more than     countries  world vision s staff in nepal  along with staff mobilized from other countries  are delivering temporary shelters  food  hygiene kits  water  emergency health and protection for children  according to a release from the organization </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as some business school students worked from afar to amass and send funds and supplies  others are hard at work on the ground  yale school of management alumnus  mba     lokesh todi returned to his native nepal last year after graduation  surviving the earthquake unharmed  todi and his cousin  aditya  acted quickly to launch a fundraising effort on indiegogo com  reaching an initial goal of         quickly  the cousins raised their target to         and have already reached         </paragraph>
    <paragraph> local ngos often don t have the ability or the connections to raise funds abroad   but  they will  still  be on the ground when a lot of people who come temporarily to the country will be leaving   todi told cnn   we want to make sure that the ngos that will be here for a long time will get the money   todi is using lessons he learned in a course on managing global catastrophes at som to identify where to channel the money raised  at yale  he and classmates studied the aftermath of the      haiti earthquake  learning that organizations focused on children  women and sanitation issues are among the most important to support immediately </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to cnn  funds raised via the indiegogo com campaign could take a week or more to reach nepal  but when they do todi has arranged for them to be received by global shapers  a network of young leaders he is part of  organized by the world economic forum  in the meantime  he s collected some cash donations in person or via bank transfer  which he has used to buy basic food supplies for distribution </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  mba students in the united states are crowdfunding as well  at uc berkeley s haas school of business  students who traveled to nepal last year with the school s international business development program have launched a fundraising campaign on tilt  with a goal of raising         </paragraph>

    <paragraph>laird was part of team beauty for ashes in kathmandu last june  which worked with a group of nepalese women that helps survivors of sex trafficking earn money through handicrafts  she and other students who participated have been in touch with the women they worked with and learned that all are ok  but their families are not  the nepalese women have been trying to get in touch with relatives and help others in need on foot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of her experience with her team in nepal last year  laird saw that hospitals in nepal were severely underfunded  many having only one bathroom   nepal was far worse than i expected  in terms of how destitute it is  if that s the way it was like in good times  i can t imagine what it s like now   she said </paragraph>

  <title>unc kenan flagler launches new institute to study private capital</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>if you don t fully understand the role of private capital markets in the global economy  you are not alone  the university of north carolina kenan flagler business school has launched a new institute for private capital  ipc  designed to help change that </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the institute will come to define how private capital is taught and learned in every business school   said kenan flagler dean douglas a  shackelford  he announced the new institute at the school s eighth annual alternative investments conference on april   th to an assembled crowd of more than     business and academic leaders and business school students   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the plan for the ipc is to create databases  produce research and develop curriculum and educational initiatives that are missing today  included within the database will be private capital investment   such as venture capital funds  buy out and growth capital funds  hedge funds  debt funds  real estate funds  natural resources funds  and closely held and family businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph> by creating the most comprehensive database on private capital in the world  we will be able to provide dependable information  ground breaking research and accurate benchmarking across the industry and the academy   said gregory w  brown  kenan flagler professor of finance and director of the ipc   few academic researchers focus on private capital because so little data is available   and ipc will change that  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dean shackelford called the creation of the ipc just the beginning  indicating that kenan flagler plans to expand its focus on research  teaching  public policy and outreach initiatives that affect private capital markets   since private capital constitutes the majority of global capital  ipc research will have a significant impact on practice and policy  and will spur curricular innovations nationally and internationally   he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>unc kenan flagler is also home to the private equity research consortium  perc   where academic and industry experts collaborate to generate new knowledge about private capital markets based on objective academic research  the success kenan flager has experienced with perc will help guide the work of the newly formed ipc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a research council will help identify important areas for new research and provide feedback on projects the ipc undertakes  founding members of this research council include raymond chan of adams street partners  peter cornelius of alpinvest partners the carlyle group  barry griffiths of landmark partners  michael miles of guggenheim investments  kevin sigrist of the north carolina retirement systems  ruediger stucke of warburg pincus and brown </paragraph>

    <paragraph>the morrison family s ties to ucla run deep  both of their daughters earned mbas at anderson  and they have provided financial support to the school s athletics and biomedical sciences departments in addition to this most recent gift  much of their philanthropy has been made possible thanks to sherie morrison s trailblazing work developing genetically engineered antibodies  research that was lauded as a scientific breakthrough and has led to the development of many therapeutics  currently  sherie continues her advanced research studies using antibody based therapeutics to treat cancer </paragraph>

  <title>potential leaders in global real estate should have mcdonough in their b school sights</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the new steers center for global real estate at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  launched yesterday  promises to redefine the educational experience received by both undergraduate and graduate students preparing for leadership roles in global real estate  the school reports  formerly known as the school s real estate finance initiative  the steers center will offer students one on one career planning with professors and mentors  as well as experiential learning opportunities through the real estate clinic and real estate laboratory  consulting projects and career treks will further expand the global nature of real estate opportunities at mcdonough </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcdonough dean david a  thomas asserts that the new steers center will offer students  a transformative program that provides an opportunity to engage the world of real estate through a very practical approach   he also expects the steers center to propel mcdonough toward its goal of becoming the premier destination for global business education  he said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the steers center was made possible thanks to a    million gift from mcdonough alum robert h  steers  b      and his wife  lauren  it significantly upgrades its predecessor  the real estate finance initiative  which was established with a prior    million gift from the steers  steers is ceo of leading global investment manager cohen   steers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for why more money now  steers was straightforward   it was important to me to see georgetown mcdonough create a formal real estate center with the financing to be permanent and to think and plan strategically   he said in a statement  with double the funding  steers expects the new center to foster innovation and new strategies in the field  that prospective students and employers will look at and say  wow  that s really something special    he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>professor matthew cypher will serve as director of the steers center for global real estate  which will advance a well thought out real estate curriculum based on a student centered approach in which all students meet individually with faculty  executives in residence and alumni mentors to tailor career plans reflecting their individual goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the steers center will apply a clinic focused approach in which students get to try out what they re learning before being on the job  mcdonough s washington  dc  location is an incredible strength of the program  giving students the chance to cut their teeth in one of the most globally significant real estate markets  already  through the real estate clinic  mba students have worked with invesco to underwrite more than    billion in live real estate transactions  and through the real estate laboratory  undergraduate and mba students have full access to a building on wisconsin avenue by joss realty partners  where they have taken part in a range of projects  including building valuation  studying how to maximize parking revenue and redesigning the courtyard in partnership with architecture firms </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of dean thomas  goal of mcdonough rising to be the top destination for a global graduate management education  that the steers center will provide such global opportunities is also huge  mba students will travel abroad to complete consulting projects focused on real estate  and they will also meet with global real estate employers around the world  as they did through a recent career trek to bogota  colombia </paragraph>
    <paragraph> through the steers center for global real estate  we have married the academic excellence of the georgetown university classroom with the applied experiences afforded by our location in the global washington  dc  real estate community   cypher said in a statement  cypher believes that this point of differentiation will set the steers center apart from similar real estate initiatives at other leading business schools  such as columbia s paul milstein center for real estate  wharton s samuel zell and robert lurie real estate center and wisconsin s james a  graaskamp center for real estate   no other program will be able to match our strengths in developing students to become leaders in the field of real estate   cypher asserts </paragraph>

    <paragraph>speaking to the wall street journal  hbs dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold explained that the school hopes through the program to give women a fuller sense of what an mba can lead to  calling the mba  a misunderstood degree   she noted that there is a perception among many that pursuing one  must mean you want to go work in a bank forever and sit in a cubicle and wear a suit  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for why peek weekend targets students from women s college  leopold explained that graduates of these schools make attractive mba candidates because they have often held leadership roles on campus  hbs has historically looked for applicants who demonstrate clear leadership abilities or potential </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the inaugural peek weekend will take place on the hbs campus on june   th to   st  hbs faculty will lead class discussions on current management challenges using the school s signature case method of instruction  in the evenings  participants will analyze real life business cases  and in morning study groups and classes they ll convene to discuss their ideas with other participants and faculty   this is the life of an mba student at hbs   read a page devoted to the new program on the hbs website  the weekend will also include a range of workshops with hbs staff  students and alumnae </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the intent of the program targeting college students is not to attract younger students to the business school  but rather to help them better understand the hbs mba  at a time when they re making decisions about next steps   leopold told the journal  the average incoming hbs student is    with about four years of work experience  according to the class profile </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs staff visited wellesley college and barnard college last week to announce the new program  but it is also open to students from other women s colleges  to be considered  members of the class of            and      must complete a basic online application form by the may   th deadline  cost of attendance is       which includes all materials  housing and meals  scholarships will be available based on financial need </paragraph>

    <paragraph>in contrast  those with the  getting back my own money  mindset hold their purse strings more tightly   consumers who see their refund as money owed them by the government believe their refund belongs where it can do good in the long run   in an investment  savings account  or as a means of debt reduction   carlson said  those in this camp who do spend the refund are more likely than the  bonus  folks to spend it at stores where they shop on a regular basis  the survey found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the survey also found that those expecting larger refunds probably filed earlier than those who are still busy finishing up those returns at the eleventh hour  likewise  more of the early filers plan to spend their refund  of those who filed in january     percent reported plans to spend their refund  compared to just    percent of those filing by tax day </paragraph>

  <title>financial times data suggest mba roi is greater for younger students</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>parsing through data from its      global mba rankings  the financial times has come to the conclusion that the earlier you get your mba degree  the more you stand to boost your salary  both in percentage and absolute terms  combining survey responses from the mba class of      with analyses of their career progress and salaries  the latest ft rankings data reveal a more significant jump in pay for younger graduates in the three years after graduation than for their older classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the ft analysis  participants aged    and under when they began their degree enjoyed salary increases of nearly         three years out from graduation  a     percent increase over their pre mba salary  those who were    to    when they began their degree program reported an average pay increase of          to nearly double their pre mba salary  the oldest members of the class  those aged    or above  had an average pay increase of          representing a roughly    percent bump over their pre mba salaries  this pattern was observed in all industry sectors and countries  regardless of whether graduates worked overseas or changed industries  according to the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in citing these statistics  the ft made no mention of the fact that the opportunity costs for younger students would likewise be lower  serving to impact roi even further  younger lower level employees who opt out of the workforce for one or two years  depending on the length of the program  stand to lose less in potential income than their older counterparts in more senior roles  the ft did note that older participants were more likely to enroll in one year european mba programs than in the two year mba programs more common in the united states  presumably in part driven by opportunity cost considerations  of those surveyed by the ft     percent of mbas    or under opted for two year programs  compared to only    percent of those aged    or older </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  only   percent of respondents to the ft survey were    or younger when they started their mba  especially among top tier schools  admissions offices prefer applicants who bring multiple years of work experience to the classroom discussion  the vast majority of ft respondents      percent   were between    and     while    percent were    or above </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft data also reveal shifting motivations in pursuing the mba degree depending on the age of the students   while the younger participants are primarily motivated by salary  the more senior ones want to develop their managerial skills  those aged    to    wish to achieve both   read the ft analysis </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  the ft found the mba to be living up to expectations among graduates  even as those expectations differed from one age group to the next  a full    percent of graduates reported they had achieved their goals  whether in terms of roi or in terms of advancing to a more senior role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>when to pursue your mba degree is a decision that warrants significant forethought and research  as this ft data show  while roi is of course a consideration for all applicants  it may not be the primary driver depending on your individual goals </paragraph>

  <title>a guide to student loans for mbas</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the following sponsored content was provided to clear admit by commonbond  for more information about sponsorship opportunities with clear admit  contact us here </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first off  congratulations to all the new admits  whether you re starting your first year this fall or returning for your second year  you ll need to answer the following question  how will you pay for the next year of school  if the answer is  all or partially with student loans   we ve got you covered with the information you need to make an informed choice on the right loan for your situation  commonbond is a student lending platform founded by three mbas who created the company based on their own experiences with the unnecessarily expensive and confusing student loan system  we know the experience can be overwhelming and are here to help  so let s get started </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re a u s  citizen or permanent resident  your options are federal student loans and private student loans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the two key federal loan programs are the direct unsubsidized loan  the  stafford loan for graduate school   and the direct plus loan  you can borrow up to         annually through the direct unsubsidized loan program  that s a great foundation to your funding plan given that this loan comes with a fixed interest rate of       and an origination fee of         one of the lowest rates out there  tuition being what it is these days  however     k is unlikely to cut it  so how do you fund the rest  let s first consider the second key federal option  direct plus loans  rates are presently set at        with a       origination fee  on these loans  like the direct unsubsidized loans  direct plus loans come with the government s broad array of borrower protections   everything from deferment to income based repayment plans   but at these rates  they are likely not the best deal for mbas seeking to minimize interest costs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>private loan programs  managed by private lenders  can vary widely in terms of rates  terms  borrowers protections  customer service  etc  however  the interest rates generally land below the direct plus program  offering a savings option for mbas who have maxed out their direct unsubsidized loans  at commonbond  for example  our mba student loan starts at a fixed       rate        apr   when the borrower elects to make automatic payments   that       apr  which private lenders are required to disclose in order to help borrowers make apples to apples comparisons among private loans  includes a    origination fee  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here s a table comparing three options </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>note for international students studying in the u s   securing loans can be a challenge  and often your best resource is your school s financial aid office  they ve pretty much seen it all before and can share the experiences of other recent students to help you find the best financing option for you  many programs even maintain a special agreement with a u s  credit union or bank to help their international mbas  which could mean lower rates on your loans than other private lenders offer </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the bottom line for mbas looking for student loans  there are tradeoffs to federal and private loan options  but a mix of both can be the best bet for mbas looking for the best deal  if you have any loan or financing questions  feel free to contact our friendly care team at care commonbond co  they ll be happy to walk you through your options  for more information on borrowing through commonbond  check out our mba student loans  finally  if you re making your budget for next year  we have an automated mba budget calculator with all the inputs you need to budget for the next two years </paragraph>

  <title>columbia business school dean proposes radically simple b school rankings methodology</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>penning a recent column for forbes  the dean of columbia business school  cbs  took on the question of whether and how much the seemingly ever multiplying rankings of leading business schools matter  his answer  yes   but an applicant s individual needs should outrank any number affixed to a school in the many rankings that abound </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cbs dean glenn hubbard  an economist  argues that the quality of a business school can be measured by two simple metrics  input and output  by input he means applications  specifically how many applications a school gets and whether application volume is trending up or down   it stands to reason that the marketplace of prospective students will send the most applications to the best schools  which will  in turn  have more selective admission rates   hubbard wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for output  the second critical metric in hubbard s no nonsense formula  he refers to what happens to students when they leave the school   if the job market deems the students to have received a valuable education  they will receive good job offers   he wrote  adding that data on job offers and salary levels are therefore an important factor to consider to get at the true quality of a school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with just these two pieces  input and output  a picture emerges in which a consistent set of business schools repeatedly rise to the top  hubbard pointed out  this assessment provides a quantitative means of differentiating the best schools from the rest  these schools  hubbard continues  enjoy the  cascading effects of being a top business school   including financial resources that allow for changes to program and curriculum as needed and the ability to attract and retain top faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph> admittedly  the aggregate difference between schools in the top five or    can be slight   hubbard wrote   that means that  while rankings matter  if you are thinking about applying to business school  the question is whether the rankings matter for you   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hubbard called it human nature to apply to a school because it gets ranked highly  likening it to seeing a movie or buying a book after it wins an award   we want to experience the best   he wrote  but regardless of ranking  depending on your own needs and goals  some schools will be better for you individually than others   you owe it to yourself to do your homework on a school s academic curriculum  career management efforts  alumni network  and ability to put you in front of leaders who are shaping business today  </paragraph>

  <title>one in four hec paris graduates sets out to launch a startup</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>entrepreneurship is big and growing at hec paris  according to a recent survey of more than       graduates  the inaugural hec entrepreneurship barometer  published last week  reveals that almost    percent of hec graduates today are entrepreneurs  up from just    percent a decade ago </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hec paris has been increasingly promoting entrepreneurship over the past    years  through teaching  research  mentoring and resources like the hec incubator  to measure the impact of these initiatives  hec paris devised its new entrepreneurship barometer  which surveyed a representative panel of       alumni from the past decade from across hec s various programs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the results uncovered three main trends  namely that the desire to launch businesses is strong and growing among graduates  hec entrepreneurs are value creators in france and the businesses started by hec graduates across sectors are characterized by sound  sustainable business models </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of the growth in entrepreneurship  one of the major drivers is a desire for independence and the ability to innovate  according to survey findings  forty seven percent of survey respondents cited wanting to be their own boss as a primary motive for pursuing an entrepreneurial path  interestingly  it is not just the younger students at hec paris who show entrepreneurial drive  in fact  the percentage of entrepreneurs within the school s executive mba program  a whopping    percent  is higher than within any other program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>france seems to be the main benefactor from hec paris graduates  embrace of entrepreneurship  of the business startups launched by alumni surveyed     percent overall are incorporated in france  more alumni of the mba program   close to one third   have started businesses outside of france  but hec notes that this figure is partly ascribable to the fact that    percent of the mba program s students are foreign and some of these return to their country of origin upon graduation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the sustainability of the businesses launched by hec paris grads was another key finding of the recent survey  according to the entrepreneurship barometer  the survival rate of graduates  businesses after three years was    percent  compared to a    percent nationwide average   and about a quarter of the hec entrepreneurs use fundraising  more than twice the national average </paragraph>

  <title>tracking r  acceptances at stanford and wharton on the mba livewire</title>

    <paragraph>one interesting element in the stanford livewire data is that the average gmat scores for accepted and rejected candidates are the same  of course  one should keep in mind that many of the rejected candidates at stanford who entered results on livewire had been invited to interview at the school  stanford typically has the highest average gmat of all business schools  so it is likely that the pool of applicants was so strong that gmat scores became secondary  the fact that both accepted and rejected candidates have a gmat of     also shows that stanford bases its admissions decisions on factors other than grades and gmat scores </paragraph>

    <paragraph>amid widespread questions of credibility regarding the new methodology that led to the      results  bloomberg bw this week  march     emailed business school officials to say that it has plans for yet another overhaul of its rankings methodology and plans to publish a new ranking incorporating new and differently weighted core metrics next october  it also announced that beginning with the october publication  its mba rankings will now be published annually  a major shift from the biennial schedule it has upheld since the bw rankings launched in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the system that generated the eyebrow raising      results was based on three core metrics  student satisfaction  recruiter opinion and the research published by a business school s faculty  in this next overhaul  bloomberg bw says it plans to scrap the intellectual capital metric and include class of      placement rates three months after graduation and starting compensation for the combined classes of            these metrics will each be weighted    percent  meanwhile  the weight given to student satisfaction surveys will drop significantly  to    percent from    percent  a newly introduced survey of alumni will count for    percent of the overall score  finally  its survey of corporate recruiters will also carry less weight  down to    percent from    percent  and will rely on a single year s worth of employer opinion data </paragraph>
    <paragraph>phew  that s a lot of changes to keep track of  but the main shift  toward including more pay and placement data and weighting it more heavily than student satisfaction  will make bloomberg bw s new methodology more in line with many of the other popular rankings  which place greater importance on pay and placement data  bloomberg bw says that it plans to use      pay and placement data  even though newer data will be available in time for the forthcoming rankings  scheduled to be published in october  the magazine did not explain why it has chosen to use year old data </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here s exactly  what bloomberg bw said it its message to business school officials regarding the changes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to increasing the frequency of its full time mba rankings to every year  the magazine also announced that its undergraduate business school rankings will be published annually each spring  beginning in spring       meanwhile  the magazine plans to cease its executive mba and executive education rankings  but it will now publish its part time mba rankings annually  alongside its full time mba rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  those of us here at clear admit encourage prospective applicants to use rankings as just one of many data points when determining which mba program or programs might best meet your individual needs and goals  especially as those ranking the schools themselves still seem to have some tinkering to do </paragraph>

  <title>stanford gsb edges out hbs  wharton in      u s  news   world report rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford s graduate school of business took the number one spot in the latest u s  news   world report rankings of the nation s best mba programs  released yesterday  knocking harvard business school  hbs  to second and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school to third  last year  the three powerhouse schools tied for first place  but slight differences on core metrics caused hbs and wharton to slip this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>u s  news uses multiple core measurements to compile its rankings  with the greatest weight given to quality assessments by deans and mba directors at peer schools and corporate recruiter survey scores  wharton s scores slipped in both these regards  as well as in average pay for its mba graduates  precipitating its drop this year in the rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford came out ahead in terms of average gmat gre scores        average undergraduate gpa        and overall selectivity   with an acceptance rate of just     percent  it was by far the most selective school of all those ranked  with hbs accepting    percent and wharton       percent   these leading metrics helped the west coast school edge out hbs this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>average salary and bonus  another core metric employed by u s  news  varied very little among the top    schools  hbs was tops in this regard  at           mit was second  at           and stanford was a close third  at           but not far behind at all were wharton  at           and dartmouth college s tuck school of business  ranked ninth overall   at          </paragraph>

  <title>who makes a good applicant to cornell s johnson graduate school of management </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with the round   deadline for applications to the samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management at cornell university just a few days away  are you busy putting the finishing touches on your application  maybe you are just beginning to consider applying in the year ahead  in either case  if johnson at cornell is on your radar  read on to learn more about just what the school is looking for in its applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we recently spoke with eddie asbie  associate director of admissions and financial aid  who joined johnson in      to help develop the two year mba in ithaca class  in our interview  asbie took time to share some of what makes a good applicant in the eyes of the johnson admissions committee  beyond the obvious solid entrance exam scores and strong academics that are par for the course with a top tier ivy league school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>collaboration</paragraph>
    <paragraph>topping asbie s must have list for johnson candidates includes those that can truly embrace working in groups and thrive on collaboration   good applicants are those who can show evidence of their ability to collaborate throughout their work experiences  through leadership roles they ve pursued  and even through roles they ve served in their community   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> ultimately we are thinking about a candidate who is going to be a part of johnson s community for a year or two and bring unique value to their team  we also have a very diverse  vibrant community at cornell  and we seek candidates that are ready  willing and able to collaborate with students  classmates  faculty and recruiters from a broad spectrum of different backgrounds   of constant consideration is the possibility of placing candidates in front of the school s top recruiters   employers seek collaborators   asbie says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of how best to communicate your collaborative abilities as part of your application  asbie recommends highlighting teambuilding experiences on your resume  including times when you ve supervised or worked as part of a group or led a project  for example  demonstrating involvement in your community is also important   a recommender is a perfect person to attest to your ability to work in partnership with others or in teams   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>self awareness</paragraph>
    <paragraph>asbie is always on the lookout for candidates who are self aware with clear short  and long term goals and cognizant of both their strengths and weaknesses   if you are considering a career switch and tap into an industry that you have no background in  we want to know what kind of networking you are conducting  illustrate that you understand this is new territory and that you are taking the necessary steps to understand what the job function entails and what it takes to be successful  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>also vitally important is the ability to be self aware in regard to your academic background  he says  if you are from a non quantitative background  if your standardized test scores are below average or if your current job isn t quant focused  show an awareness of that fact and the steps you are taking to address it   are you retaking the standardized test  asking for additional quant focused assignments within the workplace  or completing an online course from an accredited institution  if so  share that with us   asbie encourages   if there are any red flags or something that may become a red flag in the future  address it   he says   these actions illustrate your ability to be self aware and implement steps to address deficiencies  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>true knowledge of johnson</paragraph>
    <paragraph> johnson pursues candidates who are ready to roll up their sleeves and learn by being immersed in our program and culture   asbie notes  due diligence is invaluable when it comes to understanding the culture  the education you will receive and the community  don t be  that  applicant who sounds like he she is reading straight from the school website when talking about the program  he warns </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a campus visit is one of the most effective means to get to know johnson  if you can visit  be sure to connect with students  especially those within the specific function or industry that interests you  if not  or in addition  network with johnson alumni and the admissions team as part of countless events held around the world or via social media events like webinars for prospective applicants   when contemplating two years of your life and the financial investment associated with enrolling in business school  you need to conduct significant research to explore your future community  painting an accurate picture of what johnson is and where you fit in that portrait  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>willingness to be challenged</paragraph>
    <paragraph> we want individuals who are not afraid of their perspectives being challenged and who are seeking new opportunities   he said  business school is an amazing opportunity to work with students from diverse backgrounds and industries  as well as an incredibly talented faculty   there will be times when you are provided with constructive criticism   asbie warns   these conversations can be challenging  we want candidates who are open to these opportunities to improve and develop plans for implementation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond these four key points  asbie adds that academics are equally important to johnson  his team wants evidence that a candidate has full confidence that he she can and will do well at johnson  letters of recommendations are extremely important and provide a venue for those who know you well to speak about work ethic  motivation and drive   all information a candidate places on an application provides a snapshot of the person you are   he says  make information relevant to the application process  he notes   including high school information and corresponding achievements is not relevant to business school admission  yet we see it every application cycle  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there you have it  straight from johnson s associate director of admissions and financial aid   what cornell looks for in its candidates  good luck on those applications </paragraph>

  <title>association of mbas  amba  director predicts future mba trends</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an article in today s independent provided a glimpse into the future of the mba degree as the director of a global mba accrediting body shared his picks for the top five mba trends of       andrew main wilson is ceo of the association of mbas  amba   described as an international impartial authority on postgraduate management education  in this role  he pays close attention to the ever evolving mba  in the near future  he tells us to look for alternative funding sources for mba studies  a wider range of specializations  more growth in entrepreneurialism  curriculum changes and flexible delivery and learning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>citing the amba      salary survey  wilson notes that corporate sponsorship of the mba has been and continues to fall  which has led to the development of new funding sources  such as crowd funding and peer to peer lending  these  he says   are likely to increase in popularity   and are certainly going to become a trend in       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wilson also anticipates the comeback of the mba specialization  which was highly popular about    years ago  the specializations of      will include some from the past  such as ones related to finance  marketing  strategy and technology  but new ones will also become more prevalent  such as luxury goods  healthcare  aviation  education and energy  wilson writes  citing input from mba recruiters  he also anticipates a rise in specializations in areas such as human resource management  project and program management  marketing and supply chain management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>something else wilson sees in his crystal ball includes a growing trend toward entrepreneurialism as part of the mba  notably  says wilson  entrepreneurial mba studies are becoming increasingly popular both in the eyes of students and employers   whereas in the past  big employers might have been reluctant to hire mba graduates with significant entrepreneurship coursework for fear that the new recruits would use the job to learn the ropes before leaving to start ventures of their own  today s large firms are increasingly recognizing that innovation and entrepreneurial skills are vital to enable them to compete   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several leading business schools have already begun to implement the curriculum changes that wilson predicts will be a fourth trend in the near future  some of the most significant changes to core curriculum are likely to be more focus on leadership  entrepreneurship  more specializations and greater emphasis on corporate social responsibility  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lastly  wilson predicts that greater expectation on the part of students for flexibility in the way in which they learn will drive further innovation in how mba programs are delivered  this could range from programs featuring multiple entry points throughout the years to blended learning platforms combining both online and classroom based teaching  and business schools offering multiple locations will become increasingly common  especially with an ever growing focus on globalization within the business world </paragraph>

  <title>prodigy finance offers no co signer loans  helping solve funding challenges facing mbas studying abroad</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>studying outside of the country of your nationality or residence can present many benefits to prospective mba applicants  see the world  improve language skills  expand horizons  learn first hand how increasingly global the business world has become  and yet  one major hurdle can sometimes prevent ambitious  talented prospective mba applicants from pursuing their education abroad  that pesky little detail of funding </paragraph>
    <paragraph>traditional banks are reluctant to lend across borders because tracking and enforcement of those loans suddenly becomes more difficult  many u s  banks  for example  won t lend to foreign students without a u s  co signer  someone local the banks can go after to recoup their debt if the borrower fails to repay </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a new way for international students to finance their mbas   with no co signer</paragraph>
    <paragraph>cameron stevens  a south african who had been living in malaysia  was delighted to be accepted to study at insead  only to confront exactly the funding challenge outlined above  despite this  he managed to make his way to insead  where he discovered that quite a few of his classmates had similar problems  together  he and two other insead students came up with a solution  and in      prodigy finance was born </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how does prodigy finance work </paragraph>
    <paragraph> go fund yourself   reads the company s playful advertising line  in fact  that s exactly how it works  prodigy finance is based on a community funded model in which international students attending mba programs abroad receive loans made possible by investments from alumni of the school they attend  for instance  alumni who attended insead will invest in a bond to fund current insead students  additional investors often include the business schools themselves  the school community and other investors or institutions interested in higher education or social impact  by investing in these current international students  they are also investing in the value of the given school s mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>application process  interest rates and eligibility</paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for the borrowers  each applicant receives an individualized interest rate  which will apply over a floating base rate  students  individualized interest rates are based on a number of factors having to do both with the applicants themselves  as well as the quality of bureau information prodigy finance is able to obtain for them  their affordability and other market rates they may have access to  as well as the average target rate that prodigy must achieve for the alumni investors and the portfolio of students are also taken into account   the rates that we quote are anywhere between   and    percent above the base rate  and in general  the apr sits between   and   percent   says liz reid  prodigy finance s student brand manager </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to qualify for a prodigy finance loan  applicants must provide proof of acceptance to a participating school  the entire    minute application process takes place online  beginning with the applicant stating how much he or she hopes to borrow  within   business days  applicants receive conditional approval  their interest rate and their loan amount  once conditional approval is in place  the borrower can accept the terms  pay an administration fee  which ranges from between     and     percent of the approved loan amount  depending on the length of the program   provide supporting documentation and be on their way to the mba program of their dreams  once they arrive at school  they will digitally sign the loan agreement  and funds will be disbursed directly to the school  in instances in which a student s loan amount exceeds tuition  additional funds for living expenses will be deposited directly into the student s bank account </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students from more than     countries are eligible as long as the school they hope to attend is outside of their country of nationality or residence   u k  students are an exception  because prodigy is u k  based  students from that country can take part even if they plan to attend a u k  school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>furthermore  with a prodigy finance loan  there is no need for guarantees  co signers or collateral  and borrowers don t have to start repaying until six months after their study period has ended  as long as they are full time students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy finance  from inception to today</paragraph>
    <paragraph>stevens and his co founders began prodigy finance to fill the funding gap faced by many international applicants across the globe  in the eight years since  the program has grown to    schools across the united states  europe  asia and africa  including columbia business school  london business school and ceibs  to name just a few   click for a complete list of participating schools   the company plans to expand to even more schools in time  as for the investors  so far prodigy finance s community based funding model is working beautifully   in terms of repayments  we have over    percent repayment rates to date   says prodigy s reid   the main reason we believe repayment rates are so high is because of our community funded model   the students know that the money is coming from alumni who were students once themselves  they don t want to let that community down by defaulting on their loans  they also know that the investors can see their repayment status   it s almost like a  social pressure  in a way   reid adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy finance investors earn up to   percent annually through a low risk investment that allows them to support students at their alma mater  talk about a win win </paragraph>

    <paragraph>in terms of advice for how to approach the tbd  here s what lamb had to say   the tbd is an opportunity for you to express yourself both as an individual and a member of a functioning team  remember to balance these two roles during this exercise and make the most of it   this is your time to show us that you are a fit for wharton as an individual  and also a wharton community and team member  </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business teams with school of education to launch program for educators</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>recent research has shown that school leadership has a dramatic impact on student achievement  so stanford has launched an innovative program designed to help district school leaders strengthen their strategic thinking  problem solving skills and leadership ability as a means of boosting achievement among all students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford s graduate school of business   gsb  has partnered with its graduate school of education  gse  to develop the new program  which is called the executive program for education leaders  epel   epel  which targets superintendents and two to three members from their central office  will focus exclusively on leaders from california school districts in its first year  epel will span an entire year  involving participants in both on campus and distance learning sessions taught by stanford faculty  as well as leaders in the field who will speak to the class </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new epel program will be offered by the stanford educational leadership initiative  seli   which also runs a principal fellows program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>seli executive director rebecca katz notes that the epel program will be different from other leadership training offered in education  which often focuses on managing rather than on changing organizations   excellent management skills are crucial  of course  but today s leaders have limited opportunities to interact with researchers to come up with new ways to approach and solve problems   katz said in a statement  epel will offer such opportunities  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>drawing on the expertise of stanford faculty  the program will cover topics including design thinking  crisis management  motivating and managing people  implementing and assessing reform  leading and supporting workforce learning  technology in education  and turning around low performing districts and schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program will begin in july with one week on the stanford campus  during which the focus will be on general management  over the ensuring year  the program will continue with off campus  online sessions and one on one support  as well as two additional weekend on campus sessions  on in october and the other in march  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in addition to exposing participants to cutting edge research being conducted by stanford faculty  the program fosters collaboration  giving space and time for leaders to build relationships and create networks that support continued learning   katz said in a statement   it can often be lonely in these leadership roles and these supports are crucial to success  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the multidisciplinary approach  leveraging the expertise of both the gsb and gse  is designed to help encourage and equip educators with innovative solutions to problems their school districts face   over the course of the year  we hope participants will extend beyond their comfort zone and find new ways to have impact   stanford gsb professor larissa tiedens  who serves as faculty co director of epel  said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applications for the new epel program are being accepted on a rolling basis until april  st  the cost of the program  which is highly subsidized by stanford gse and gsb  is        per team member  which includes tuition  room  board and course materials </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>as applicants to harvard business school  hbs  are probably well aware  admissions director dee leopold and her team are scheduled to send out the first of its round   interview invitations tomorrow  wednesday  january   th  what about the blizzard that s blanketing the northeastern portion of the united states  you wonder  as of yesterday  leopold expected that invites will still go out as planned  at noon boston time   if we need to delay  we will let you know via this blog  a general announcement on the admissions website and also with a voicemail recording on our general phone line   she wrote in a post to her director s blog  but as of this writing  no updates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  some details about hbs interview invites  they will go out in two waves  one tomorrow  and a second on february  th  historically  hbs has sent out the bulk of its invites in the first wave  leopold offered that her best guess is that roughly     applicants will receive invitations tomorrow  with another     or so receiving invitations next week   i ve said this before  but please don t speculate or develop theories or algorithms about first vs  second   she urged   it doesn t work that way  and it has nothing to do with when you submitted  where you live  or the first letter of your last name  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the emails will include all the details you need regarding scheduling  locations  dates  etc  hbs s online scheduler will be available beginning the day after invites go out  giving applicants time to give some thought to the dates  times and locations that will work best for them  please note  hbs also offers a range of related activities and events for those who interview on campus  providing an opportunity to interact with fellow applicants as well as current students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for applicants to the     program  all invitations to interview for this program will be extended on february  th  so have no fear when you don t hear anything tomorrow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>additionally  all candidates who will not be continuing in the admissions process will be notified on february  th of their  release  from consideration </paragraph>

  <title>mba entrepreneurial grads report significant payoffs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba entrepreneurial grads specifically those who launched startups during or soon after business school  can expect to make as much as their peers who follow more traditional career paths not long out of school  according to survey data collected as part of the financial times       business school rankings research </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of the       mba graduates from the world s top     business schools who responded to the ft     percent had launched a start up  within three years of graduation  the average annual income of these entrepreneurs was           compared to          across the entire sample  the ft reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a mere   percent of startup founders reported an annual salary of zero three years out  though the ft points out that survey respondents did have an option to not reveal their income level  so the data may not fully reflect the financial risk taking faced by entrepreneurial grads  that said  of the companies launched by survey participants     percent did report still operating a full three years later </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in general  startups launched by mba grads tend to fare better than those launched by non mbas  citing the u s  bureau of labor statistics  the ft noted that roughly    percent of new businesses survive three years  far less than the findings of the ft survey and less still than reports from individual business schools  at mit sloan  for example     percent of the      mba graduates started a business  and    percent of those were still operating three years later  according to the ft report </paragraph>
    <paragraph> of course   say business school professors  startups launched by mba grads do better because their founders have prepared for challenges within the classroom  iese professor pedro nueno told the ft   if someone is prepared they are more likely to be willing to take a lower salary or cut back to maintain cash flow   he said   they tend to manage better than somebody who just sees an idea and launches without too much analysis  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nueno has been tracking the start up success of his mba students for several years and has found that    percent of those who started companies were still in operation five years after graduation  the majority of startups launched by his students are small solo ventures or businesses with just a few employees  still  nueno has found that they earn as much if not more than their peers who went to work for large corporations  the ft notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft s mba survey revealed that a gender gap exists within entrepreneurship among mbas  with only    percent of female graduates reporting starting a company  compared to    percent of male grads  but  notes the ft   this divide is little different to the wider world of start ups  in which male founders are more common the female ones  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not all survey respondents went as far as to say that business school itself was helpful with the practical matters of launching a startup     percent said no  or securing financing  a full    percent disagreed   likewise  enthusiasm for the value of business school s alumni networks in the startup launching process was lukewarm  a third disagreed with the statement that alumni helped start their business and more than half     percent  stated that alumni provided no help with fundraising </paragraph>
    <paragraph>both the success of mba graduate founders as compared to their classmates in traditional fields and the startup survival rates varied from business school to business school  with institutions ranked in the top five for entrepreneurship teaching faring the best  for example  entrepreneur mba grads from top ranked stanford graduate school of business reported average salaries of          three years after graduation  compared with          for fellow graduates who didn t launch businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite these encouraging statistics  entrepreneurship is still pursued by relatively few within business education  the ft noted  taken together  the survey findings suggest that just   percent of the      mba graduate community currently makes an income solely from entrepreneurial ventures </paragraph>

  <title>georgetown s mcdonough school of business innovates its approach to admissions</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>georgetown university s mcdonough school of business wants applicants to the school to walk away feeling good about their experience  regardless of whether they gain acceptance or ultimately enroll  to this end  the school s admissions team  led by associate dean of mba admissions shari hubert  launched an innovative initiative last spring to understand the applicant s entire journey through the admissions process from the moment they begin to research schools right up to their arrival on campus  for those who are admitted and enroll   their findings have already begun to reshape the georgetown mcdonough admissions process for the better  hubert hopes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hubert joined georgetown mcdonough in december       coming from a career in campus recruiting for the peace corps  citigroup and general electric   i saw a need for us as an admissions office to be more connected to our customers prospective applicants to understand what they were going through and how they experience us as they apply to business school   hubert says  an mba applicant herself once  she holds a degree from harvard business school   she remembers how daunting the experience can be   i wanted to engender goodwill no matter what the outcome   she says   i wanted them to walk away saying georgetown is a wonderful institution that lives its  jesuit  values   of course  she also hoped that by creating a more positive experience for applicants  the school would increase its yield </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hubert shared her goals with graham richmond of southwark consulting  a higher education consultancy that helps admissions offices identify and attract high quality talent   richmond co founded clear admit before leaving two years ago to start his own firm   richmond was reminded of a presentation he d seen by innovation consultancy peer insight  which uses design thinking to help companies map their customers  experiences  in       peer insight helped the university of virginia s darden school of business map out the entire two year mba journey  richmond reached out to peer insight s natalie foley  who thought a design mapping project focused specifically on the mba admissions process sounded like a terrific idea  and so this innovative collaboration to understand and enhance mcdonough s admissions process was born </paragraph>
    <paragraph>southwark and peer insight partnered to offer mcdonough a comprehensive study combining a quantitative survey of almost       prospective mba applicants about their perceptions of georgetown mcdonough as compared to peer schools with a qualitative piece that involved in depth interviews with a dozen applicants to georgetown specifically </paragraph>
    <paragraph>understanding mcdonough s place among its peers</paragraph>
    <paragraph>southwark conducted the quantitative piece  fielding responses from     gmat gre test takers to provide georgetown mcdonough with an understanding of how the school is perceived in the marketplace and how it stacks up to its peers  though hubert and her team are still dissecting the results  the high level takeaways from this portion of the study were that press  people and presence  specifically an online presence  are critical  as for the press part   a sense of buzz and transparency are important   hubert says   business school is a big ticket item people are investing in  and they want to understand as much as they possibly can  they especially value third person validation about schools   this validation can come from traditional media  rankings and social media </paragraph>
    <paragraph>where people are concerned  the survey showed that applicants had very favorable responses when they received consistent interaction with a school s representatives  to this end  hubert initiated a team wide training program to equip the entire mcdonough admissions team  from the administrative assistant up to herself  with stellar communications skills   we are all ambassadors of this program and of georgetown   she says  and to strengthen its online presence  the school has completely overhauled its website to provide information in a clear  accessible manner  additionally  the admissions team examined and made significant changes to email communication sent to applicants and those who had received admission or waitlist decisions to make sure it was targeted and purposeful   there has been a significant decrease in the number of calls and emails we receive from applicants with questions  we believe because our information is now easier to find  more tailored and timely   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another realization that came out of the quantitative survey was just how important georgetown mcdonough s location is to prospective applicants   we learned that washington  dc  was the real gem the fact that we are located in an international  culturally diverse city at the nexus of business and policy   hubert says   by virtue of being here we provide a credible value  and we make sure that there are many opportunities for our students to realize that and take advantage of that  we take them out of the classroom and put them in d c  and vice versa  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a closer look at how applicants experience the mcdonough application process</paragraph>
    <paragraph>peer insight headed up the qualitative piece  conducting a dozen interviews with a set of applicants to georgetown mcdonough who represented a full spectrum of applicant experiences  including candidates who were admitted and declined  those who were not admitted  those who were admitted and enrolled and those who put down a deposit after being admitted but ultimately didn t enroll  the open ended interviews were designed to elicit both emotional and analytical responses to questions about what each applicant experienced at each step in the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>peer insight culled this copious data to create an in depth journey map tracking each applicant through    distinct steps in the application process  noting highs and lows along the way  some of the highs and lows revealed by the journey map weren t terribly surprising  across the board  preparing for and taking the gmat was identified as a low point in the process by most everyone interviewed  in contrast  the moment of finally hitting  submit  was a universal high  more surprising  though  was realizing the low that immediately followed submission   there was this kind of radio silence   notes richmond  and applicants were left feeling like they had just fallen into a black hole </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the peaks and valleys that emerged on the journey map became opportunities for georgetown mcdonough to try to mitigate the low points and enhance the high points  brainstorm sessions bringing together the mcdonough  southwark and peer insight teams focused on just this  and as a group they came up with some innovative action steps to take in response to the findings  for example  in order to be more a part of the high that applicants feel when they hit submit  hubert and her entire team created an exuberant congratulatory video  letting applicants know what to expect in the next few weeks  as for the low that surrounded preparing for and taking the gmat or gre   it s a non negotiable  they have to take it   says hubert   but we found we could help them prepare by providing virtual workshops  and that s what we did   systematically  working in mini groups  hubert s team went through all the highs and lows and came up with two to three goals for addressing each one  some of these action steps have already found their way into a revised admissions process  such as the team video upon submission and gmat workshops  and others will roll out as part of later admissions cycles   the end goal is for students to have a positive experience and walk away with a sense of goodwill with georgetown   hubert says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not all applicants are alike</paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  because people are all different  not every applicant had the same emotional journey  in fact  peer insight s qualitative study found that applicants could be grouped into four general personas or archetypes  which they gave names  the first  the   good feeling  seeker   is an applicant who wants to  click  with a school  to feel a sense of connection with the people he or she interacts with in the course of the application process  this type of applicant will often visit the school multiple times over the course of the application process and will ultimately choose an mba program based on a gut feeling about how the school made him or her feel </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the second  the  goal oriented ghost   refers to the applicant who doesn t need or want to engage much with a school because he or she has a shorter list of essential criteria often ranking  cost  whether or not it could support a spouse s work requirements  etc  this person applies to fewer programs and is methodical and efficient with the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the third persona  the  data enthusiast   carefully examines rankings and the statistics behind them  scrutinizes information on school websites and elsewhere and may even create a decision matrix in choosing an mba program   these applicants may need extra time to make decisions  and they are looking for data to tell them the right answer   hubert offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and finally there s the  fit questioner   who has a very clear idea of his or her future goals and wants to choose the mba program that will mesh perfectly with them  seeking a cultural as well as an intellectual fit with a school  he or she may visit campus multiple times as part of the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>understanding what drives these different types of applicants and how they respond to steps along the application journey has transformed mcdonough s approach as well   the personas have provided a way for us to segment the communication we have with applicants based on personality type   hubert says  some types  like the goal oriented ghost  don t need or want a lot of communication from the school  others  like the good feeling seeker  want near constant contact   we had a one size fits all communication plan  one of our  ah ha  moments in this experience was realizing that we need to be more segmented and take into consideration where people fall within these personas and what we share with them as a result  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not afraid to share what they ve learned</paragraph>
    <paragraph>as a partner with mcdonough in this first of its kind study of the admissions process  peer insight s natalie foley was most surprised by how open hubert and her team were to sharing their findings   at a high level  sometimes academia gets a reputation for not being innovative   foley says   i was really pleasantly surprised that shari led this process in such an open way and engaged others throughout the georgetown community   indeed  hubert immediately shared the insights with her colleagues in career services and mba programs   we ve found that other departments are excited to partner with us to improve the applicant experience   hubert says  noting that her colleagues have collaborated on an admitted student website  hosted joint events and donated their time to welcome prospective students   ultimately  the students who attend georgetown will work directly with career services and mba programs  so these departments have a vested interest in this process   she points out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcdonough also now shares a version of the journey map with applicants as part of the admissions information sessions it hosts   we encouraged them to say to applicants   we know this is the journey you re on    says southwark s richmond   showing that sort of empathy with candidates goes a long way toward inspiring goodwill toward georgetown  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  hubert and her team were invited to share their findings with other mba programs as part of a graduate management admissions council  gmac  leadership conference at the end of january   the fact that they have been selected by gmac to share with their competitors what they did just goes to show what innovators they are   says richmond   other schools haven t done this kind of journey mapping  and georgetown is confident with what they have to offer and fine with sharing it   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ultimate effects of the mcdonough admissions study and process overhaul remain to be seen  in the short term  the school has seen a positive effect on applications in rounds   and   and will continue to monitor what happens in round    if hubert has her way  yield the percentage of admitted applicants who ultimately matriculate will likewise increase  and even greater gains could still be ahead  hubert s team still hasn t even implemented all of the ideas for improvements that came from this initial study she estimates that they are about halfway there   and her team intends to survey applicants at the end of each future round to track customer satisfaction and identify even more opportunities for improvement </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg admissions director shares how school assesses candidates  interpersonal skills</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the director of admissions at northwestern university s kellogg school of management has devoted a series of recent blog posts to demystifying the admissions process at the school  her most recent post shares what she and her team are looking for as they assess candidates  interpersonal skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph>how well a candidate fits with the school s mba program is a significant consideration for the kellogg admissions team  as it is at many top programs   our community values collaboration  involvement and giving back  and we look for that in our applicants as well   wrote admissions director beth tidmarsh in a blog post earlier this week  candidates who thrive in team based environments will fit in well at the school  she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  how can you demonstrate a cultural fit with kellogg in your application  not by showing simply that you are an agreeable team player  tidmarsh wants to see that you can productively push ideas forward  even in the face of disagreement   our ideal applicant likes to hear different viewpoints  respects others  can voice and challenge opinions and isn t afraid to speak up  but can do so in a way that s collaborative and would help further a group or a classroom conversation do more than simply agree   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you have an example of just such an experience  sounds like it might make great subject matter for an essay  or perhaps your ability to work in teams is something one of your recommenders might be able to speak to </paragraph>

  <title>how to choose the right mba program</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>perhaps you re at the beginning stage of the important process to identify which mba programs you ll apply to  maybe  with multiple acceptances in hand  you have the exciting and life altering task of deciding where you ultimately want to enroll  in either case  ann richards  interim director of admissions at cornell university s samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management  has valuable insight to help you make the most informed decision possible </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there are a handful of key elements that are essential when trying to choose the right mba program for you   richards says   research  visit and conduct a self assessment to understand what s important to you   she advises </paragraph>
    <paragraph>just as important isavoiding emotional influencers that can detract from your ability to make a well informed decision  just because family members attended a particular school for generations does not make it the right school for you  for instance   you really need to know yourself and not be influenced by emotional pulls   says richards </paragraph>
    <paragraph>seek advice from recent mba graduates</paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schoolrankings can help you get a feel for what s out there  but talking to colleagues who have mbas can be even more valuable  richards advises  ask about their experience and what they would do differently if they were choosing an mba today </paragraph>
    <paragraph>look for more recent alums if possible  she recommends   most mba programs have changed drastically over the last    years   they ve overhauled their curriculums  constructed new buildings   and the nature of the career search has also changed dramatically   therefore  someone who graduated a long time ago can t offer the most current insights </paragraph>
    <paragraph>your own network will provide possibilities as well   think about people you attended college with who have gone on to get an mba and reach out to them  or look within your company or professional networks   richards suggests </paragraph>
    <paragraph>identify three to four alumni and ask for five or    minutes of their time  says richards  go to each one with a list of five to six questions that are important to you  were you challenged at your mba program  were your classmates intellectually curious  was it an active learning environment  what was the culture at the school  was it super competitive  team focused  collaborative </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  you might also want to ask about extra curricular activities  club activities  trips or treks  leadership opportunities  and access to faculty   different characteristics may have different meaning for candidates   she points out  prospective applicants who are thinking about pursuing an mba as part of a career change may want to ask about specific resources available to help with that process  whereas that won t be as important to someone who plans to return to their employer or start their own business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t forget to inquire about a school s community   the ability to participate or engage and have an impact or leave a legacy is important   richards says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>visit schools if possible  after talking with alumni  you should be able to narrow the list of schools that interest you  richards encourages prospective applicants to visit schools whenever possible  ideally when classes are in session and you can sit in on one   see what the engagement between faculty and students is like   richard recommends  how involved are the students  are they participating and engaged  what are the facilities like  what resources are available to students  how happy do the students seem </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you can t visit  correspond with the school   see what happens   do you get a response from the school  from the students  candidates can get a sense of how important they are to a school based on how responsive the members of its community are  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s not terribly important whether you visit before or after you apply  but definitely visit if you can before you make an enrollment decision  she stresses   i often hear people say   cornell wasn t on my radar until i visited   or  i was sure i wanted to attend x school  until i visited   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of getting a feel for the culture of the school  your best bet is to meet with current students and ask about their activities and extracurricular interests  if you can  attend a cultural event  listen to a guest speaker or  even better  attend a class or drop by a school happy hour  johnson recently hosted super saturday  when dozens of prospective students visited campus to interview   we happened that night to have our diwali celebration going on  which gave participating prospectives a great opportunity to see for themselves the kind of events our students take part in   richards recalls   although diwali is an indian celebration  it certainly wasn t just indian students participating  it really gives candidates a sense of what it is like to be a student here  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it usually doesn t take long to figure out if you click with a school or not  richards notes   i don t think a school should have to grow on you  you should know when you visit that it s a place you can see yourself being happy   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>size and location matter</paragraph>
    <paragraph>when it comes to mba programs  size does matter since it can impact the network you develop  when you are considering schools  think about whether or not a class is segmented into cohorts  she advises   if you get to know    people really  really well but don t know anyone else   that might be a disadvantage to you  it might not  but it s something worth thinking about  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>do you want a city school or a school that is part of a smaller community  richards links johnson s close knit community to the fact that it is not in a large urban center   everyone is close to campus   a five minute walk instead of a subway ride followed by two buses   she notes   that s true not just for students but also faculty and staff   she continues   it s not uncommon for faculty to say   i m going home to have dinner with my kids but i ll come back and see you in the library at        that does not happen at all schools  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>assessing a school s career services</paragraph>
    <paragraph>recognizing that the success of a career services office can be influenced greatly by the economy  you can still get a feel for what kind of support you ll receive in a given program  as well as how aligned their career services are with your own goals  a school may have tremendous success in placing students who want to go into consulting or finance but really struggle with candidates who want to pursue marketing  for example </paragraph>
    <paragraph> as prospective applicants look at a school s career services  they should look not only at the general placement rate but also at specifics in regard to their individual interests   richards says   if a school has a lower overall placement rate than other schools  but    percent of students are interested in entrepreneurial studies and looking to start their own businesses upon graduation  suddenly that placement rate doesn t look so bad  it is important that students look at the placement statistics through the lens of what they want to do  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what role do students play on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think as a prospective applicant you want to look for leadership opportunities  potential to have an impact  orchestrating or facilitating change  spearheading an organization or a club  and how willing the school is to support that   richards continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if having an impact and getting involved as an mba student is important to you  ask current students how easy it is to start a club or organize a conference and what kind of support the school provides if you do   those kinds of questions will be very valuable to students  particularly those that like to get involved and orchestrate change  they would be really frustrated if they landed in an environment where their voice wasn t heard or valued  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>know thyself  as an mba student you will have the best experience and get the most benefit out of the program that is the best fit for you  that makes knowing yourself and what you want a vital part of the decision making process  think about whether you want a big or small program  whether assuming a leadership role is one of your priorities  and what support you will need in your career search </paragraph>
    <paragraph>try not to fixate on brand names  richards offers   you need to look not only at the brand but at what the school s benefit is   how it will help you achieve your goals  grow  and develop your leadership skills   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  there you have it  with targeted research  campus visits and a thorough self assessment  you can be well on your way to selecting the perfect mba program for you </paragraph>

  <title>mcdonough school of business mba student shares career search experience</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>what does the career search process really look like when you re an mba student  vanessa dumonet  a second year mba student at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  generously took time out of her thanksgiving break to share just how things unfolded for her </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dumonet entered georgetown having worked for five years in marketing and business development for a large international law firm  drawing on a range of resources at mcdonough   including career coaches  career focused student groups  peer advising and the alumni network   dumonet has already received multiple full time offers for next fall and is looking forward to beginning her post mba career at luxury beauty company estee lauder </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the interview that follows  you ll hear from dumonet herself about which resources proved most valuable in landing her dream job  she s also got some great advice for prospective applicants on how to jump start a career search even before arriving on campus  so take note </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what was your career prior to mcdonough </paragraph>
    <paragraph>vanessa dumonet  prior to coming to georgetown i worked for ropes   gray llp  an international law firm  in practice development  with responsibility for business development  marketing  pr and strategic initiatives for the firm s private equity and securities and public companies practice groups  i was with ropes   gray for about five years  and for the last two years i was relocated to hong kong  which was really exciting but also terrifying </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in hong kong i was put in charge of developing the practice development team across our asia practices   which meant figuring out how we would market ourselves  help develop our practices on the ground  and integrate regional strategies with international strategies for our offices in hong kong  shanghai  and tokyo </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i knew i was going to go to business school long before that  i even took the gmat five years before applying to mcdonough  so i knew getting my mba would always be on the horizon  but some really great opportunities kept popping up at ropes  and i kept taking career focused opportunities knowing that the gmat wasn t going to expire immediately </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in retrospect  i m really glad i waited  if i had gone to business school sooner  i wouldn t have been ready to take full advantage of everything at georgetown  when i accepted my relocation to hong kong with ropes  i said openly that i would go for a few years with the plan that after that i would return to the united states and go to business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>everyone knew it was going to happen  and when i left there was at least one person in each of the asia offices  where before me there hadn t been any  i saw my role in hong kong as laying the groundwork so things wouldn t fall apart when i left  along the way  i made great connections in asia and london and in the u s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how have you utilized the mba career resources while at mcdonough  what has been most helpful </paragraph>
    <paragraph>vd  so many things have been so helpful   i couldn t put my finger on just one  it has really been the culmination of lots of different efforts  support from friends for one  mcdonough s career coaches are phenomenal and really supportive both from a strategic and personal point of view  i was also involved in the consulting club  the marketing club and women in business  the marketing club has been really instrumental in my search  including in helping me prepare to ace the marketing interviews  which are so different from other interviews  such as finance or consulting  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcdonough s peer advisors have also been really helpful  the peer advisors are comprised of second year students who help first  and second years with resume review  mock interviews and the career search  i am a peer advisor myself now  but last year they were really instrumental in my search </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alumni have also been really  really helpful  in fact  an alumna was a large reason i was able to secure my full time offer  which i now have  sometimes you just need people who have been there to cheer you on  and that s been really important to me </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what was your summer internship  what were the most important or valuable things you learned from it  anything you wish you had done differently </paragraph>
    <paragraph>vd  i worked as a summer associate at citi  specifically in citi cards  mine was a marketing business development strategy role  i was among a class of about    associates across the consumer bank  with    or    of us within cards  i was the only summer associate in my particular group  so i had one on one exposure to my senior vice president and other top executives  but i also sat with the other summer associates in cards   so there was plenty of camaraderie </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there really is nothing that i wish i had done differently  it was interesting for me because i d only ever had two very short term positions before i worked at ropes   gray  and i had been at ropes for five years  when you re part of an organization for so long  you forget what it s like to be a new person  by being a new person at citi i saw things through a whole new lens  the relationships i built  exposure to interesting projects and getting to be put into a really big organization and realizing how small i was   these were all really eye opening to me and something i wouldn t have been able to experience were i not getting my mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what do you hope to do post mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>vd  i did receive an offer from citi following my summer internship  which i was so thrilled about  upon receiving the offer  i took a step back and looked closely at what i had done in my first year at mcdonough  i was looking at marketing roles within financial services   such as the role at citi   because i imagined transitioning into such a role would be smooth based on my prior work in marketing in professional services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but i had been looking at potential opportunities in the beauty and luxury industry as well  in fact  i had also interviewed for a summer internship with estee lauder  i got through the second round  but i wasn t extended an offer for the summer  nonetheless  i kept in touch with an alum who had helped me as i went through the interview process  and she has truly become such a mentor  she is not actually that much older than i am  but she was always there and willing to take all of my phone calls  in the end  she helped put me in touch with the right people to interview for a full time position  and i was ultimately offered a job after graduation as a presidential management associate  pma   it s a great opportunity that involves completing four six month marketing rotations across many of the estee lauder brands  i am so thrilled and excited for the job </paragraph>
    <paragraph>longer term  as i told estee lauder in the interview   and i really meant it    i hope to stay there for a long time  if i look at my past experiences  i have been at the right place at the right time and created the right opportunities for myself  come next fall  i am going to be working for a great company with some really amazing people  and i just trust that some opportunities will pop up that i maybe would never even have dreamed of for myself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what advice would you offer prospective applicants in terms of preparing for the mba career search before even arriving on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>vd  good question  i don t want to say too many things  but you are about to start working harder than you ever have before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>having said that  at mcdonough the mba career center actually creates a curriculum for newly admitted students for the summer before we start the program  prior to joining in the fall we had to participate in weekly webinars and had a list of deliverables   all career focused  they proved really  really helpful to us when we got to campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  we had to work on a list of  stories  based on the types of work positions we had held  for example  we had to come up with six stories about work that we really excelled in  struggled with  times we worked with a difficult team  assumed a leadership position  etc  we each came in with about    stories  it was so useful when we began our career search to already have a catalog of stories we could pull from for our interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i would recommend that prospective applicants really think hard about what they liked and didn t like about previous jobs  i personally found that i didn t do enough of that before i started my job search  because i didn t have enough direction for myself at the very beginning  but when i started thinking long and hard about the types of positions that really get me energized  i found that helped to refine my search </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you plan to change careers  it s helpful to identify in advance whether you hope to switch function or industry or both  if you are hoping to change both function and industry  you are going to need to do more work  you are going to need to learn how to do valuations if you are switching into finance  case prep if switching into consulting  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  i am a forte fellow and i was invited to an amazing networking opportunity before my program at mcdonough began  but i wasn t able to go because i was overseas in hong kong  i would advise prospective students to take advantage of as many opportunities to network with organizations and or other students before you get to campus as possible  really anything that gets you relaxed and comfortable in the setting you are about to jump into will prove helpful </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what was the most challenging aspect of your job search process  what resources did mcdonough offer to help with this </paragraph>
    <paragraph>vd  i just got the job offer at estee lauder  so i can still remember all of the angst leading up to it  one thing that i tell the first year mba students who come talk to me as a peer advisor is to really practice and do your homework when you are preparing to meet with different companies  research is really important and differentiates you from other applicants  i knew that estee lauder was the right place for me  but being able to answer why a given company is right for you will prove important both for yourself and for the interviewer  doing this research on multiple companies is challenging because it is really time consuming  but it pays off </paragraph>
    <paragraph>something that people often forget when they are really stressed out is to use the resources in their career services office  life gets in the way  especially at school where you have to juggle the social life with the career search and with your homework  believe me  i know  but carving out time to focus on the career search every week is really important  making use of those resources   reminding yourself that there are people there to help you   that was something that definitely helped me along the way </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i d also remind prospective applicants to keep their chin up  this is a tough search  you do a lot of soul searching  and there are a lot of highs and a lot of lows because everyone will get rejected at least once  i was really thankful for my friends  my career coaches  and for having that network </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  is there anything else you d like to add </paragraph>
    <paragraph>vd  i would just say that in terms of choosing an mba  i think getting a sense for what the community life is like on campus is so important  i am so thankful i was able to get that sense even though i was applying from overseas  i did it by having conversations with students  chatting over email with various people in different departments  when you are deciding on an mba program  it s important to remember that you are going to be spending your life there for the next two years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>choosing georgetown mcdonough has been a great  great decision for me </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>amid controversy stemming from a rolling stone article describing the alleged sexual assault of a university of virginia  uva  undergraduate student at a campus fraternity party  students at uva s darden school of business have chosen to host special events to educate the darden community on the school s sexual assault policy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the darden school association  dsa  organized a  not on our grounds  first coffee   using the informal community gathering that takes place in darden s pepsico forum each morning after the first class of the day as an opportunity to discuss the case in the news as well as the not on our grounds campus initiative to end sexual violence </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the dsa also hosted a special town hall meeting on wednesday  december  rd  to help address the issue of sexual assault   the purpose of the town hall was to further educate our community about the sexual assault policy  as well as to hear from professionals and undergraduate student leaders about the initiatives they are undertaking to help generate awareness   dsa president heidi davies said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the town hall meeting included a panel discussion moderated by darden professor bobby parmar  panelists included nick hine  chair of the uva honor committee  brian head  representative of the uva chapter of one in four  an all male sexual assault peer education group  nicole thomas  uva program coordinator for prevention in the office of the dean of students  and jalen ross  president of the uva student council </paragraph>
    <paragraph> sexual assault is the most under reported crime in the nation   hine said as part of the panel </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it operates in the shadows   said head  the representative from one in four  the national organization  which advocates for support for survivors of sexual assault and bystander intervention  has had a uva chapter for the past    years   people don t want to talk about it  so they push it away  now  at uva  we re in the public eye and in a unique position to get everyone s attention on this   head continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among other things  the panelists proposed ways that members of the darden community can help combat sexual violence  some of the suggestions included supporting agencies that provide support and counseling to students  commenting on a newly proposed student sexual misconduct policy that is open for public comment through december   th  taking the not on our grounds pledge to end sexual violence   joining a student advocacy group such as one in four or the all female group one less and attending a take back the night event </paragraph>
    <paragraph>uva has been at the center of an ongoing story since the rolling stone article first ran in november  the magazine has since issued an apology  stating   in the face of new information reported by the washington post and other news outlets  there now appear to be discrepancies  in the account of the woman at the center of the story  regardless  the incident has attracted widespread attention to the issue of sexual assault at uva and beyond </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school study attributes leadership gender gap to corporate structures</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a recent study by two professors from harvard business school  hbs  and a third from hunter college examined the career ambitions of        hbs alumni to help understand the gender gap that exists in senior management positions  they found that despite similar ambitions upon joining the workforce  male respondents were much more likely than their female counterpoints to feel like their goals were met  contrary to conventional wisdom  the survey s results showed that this disparity had more to do with corporate structures than with women  opting out  to have families </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the study   rethink what you  know  about high achieving women   was conducted by hbs professor robin j  ely  pamela stone of hunter college and hbs gender initiative assistant director colleen c  ammerman and published this month in harvard business review  instead of finding that women s careers were sidetracked because they chose to prioritize family over work  the researchers discovered that the women who left their jobs after having children did so because  they find themselves in unfulfilling roles with dim prospects for advancement  or facing other career limitations   it simply isn t true that a large proportion of harvard alumnae have  opted out  to care for children   they continued   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another of the study s key findings  the vast majority of women surveyed anticipated that their careers would rank equally with those of their partners  but many of them were disappointed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the researchers hope the study will help increase public understanding of the actual factors that contribute to the persistent gender gap  shifting focus from women s individual decisions regarding family to how gender stereotypes reinforce structural hurdles women face in the workplace </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our women alums are less satisfied with their careers than men are  but we would say that workplace disappointments and shortcomings are to blame   ely told the harvard crimson </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in conclusion  ely and her co authors call for companies to evaluate ways to institutionalize a level playing field for all employees   the misguided assumption that high potential women are  riskier  hires than their male peers because they are apt to discard their careers after parenthood has become yet another bias for women to contend with  </paragraph>

  <title>tepper school of business mbas  ieee seek standards to support evolving robotics industry</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with robotic applications promising breakthroughs in fields ranging from healthcare and energy to defense and agriculture  mba students at carnegie mellon university s tepper school of business are working with experts to analyze and identify standards  best practices and ways to share knowledge that could help advance the robotics industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>engineers  designers and entrepreneurs face both opportunities and challenges in the burgeoning field of robotics  as part of a graduate level course in marketing  tepper mba students are working with cmu s robotics institute as well as experts from the institute of electrical and electronics engineers  ieee  and other industry stakeholders to understand how standardization might help the industry as a whole </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our students examined the role of engineers throughout the development process of new robotic technologies  from concept to production   john mather  tepper professor of marketing  said in a statement   this included an assessment of the major process challenges that engineers face  identifying sources of information and data that are currently available and pinpointing unmet needs   the students surveyed robotics engineers  scientists and researchers  focusing on key transfer phases in the robot design process  to pinpoint best practices and data sharing opportunities  he continued  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  the tepper students found that like many other major industries during their earliest phases  much of robotics development is conducted in isolation   without concern for compatibility with work being done by others  this is part of what makes standardization in the field so important  while there are currently government recommendations advising designers to support compatibility  as the world s largest technical professional organization  ieee could play a major role in establishing formal standards </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the input of the tepper mbas has been invaluable  say ieee representatives   they were able to combine a strong fundamental discipline in business and marketing with technology and leading experts at the carnegie mellon s national robotics engineering center   said sandeep sharma  ieee senior manager of new product development   their work has enabled ieee to better understand opportunities for our organization in providing valuable insights  products and services to the evolving robotics industry   he added  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ieee tepper marketing course project is one of several such programs at tepper  in which students work together with leading companies and organizations to tackle real world business challenges </paragraph>

  <title>new computerized matching process replaces course auctions at upenn s wharton school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>professors at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school have developed a new process for mba course selection  one they think is more fair  less stressful and less time consuming than traditional course auctions  the financial times reports  called course match  the new system involves a single round of bidding by students  after which    high powered servers spend    hours running algorithms to allocate courses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton professors decided four or five years ago that the auction system then in place wasn t working as they had intended it to  some students  especially former financial traders  were fairing really well in the auction system  in which class seats were allocated like shares issues  but others were getting inferior schedules  the process was also stressful and time intensive  requiring students to predict the bidding strategies of their peers and go through eight rounds of bidding   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we realized there might be something wrong with the mechanism itself   gerard cachon  wharton professor of operations and information management  told the ft  he spearheaded the course match initiative to find a better solution  two years in development  the new system is based on theoretical research by chicago booth professor eric budish on multi unit assignments problems </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through the course match system  which wharton students used for the first time last year  they are given     points to allocate to their preferred courses and then additional points to give to other courses in proportion  they have the ability to link courses together   bidding more to get both   are to instruct the algorithm to bid for two similar courses but then ignore one of them if the other is allocated </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second year students have       total points  and first year students have just        which students themselves agreed would help ensure that all mbas get a shot at securing the courses they want over their two year program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> every student gets the best schedule they can afford   cachon told the ft  student response has been  overwhelmingly positive   he says  adding that participants have found the allocation to be fair and the process easy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cachon believes that course match could have applications elsewhere at wharton and beyond  the next logical step would be to extend the scheduling tool to wharton s undergraduate degree program and then to the university of pennsylvania more generally  from there  other universities and even businesses could make use of it  hospitals  for example  could use the algorithms behind it to allocate complex shift patterns </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we re a business school   cachon told the ft   we re always looking for revenue generating opportunities  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>fifty active duty military members and veterans make up marshall s one year mbv program  now in its second year  the mbv program caters to current and former military who want to build foundational management skills while also learning how to transfer the management and leadership experience gained through their service to the private sector </paragraph>
    <paragraph>petraeus  who spent more than    years in the military and    months as cia director  also holds a phd from princeton university  since retiring from the military   where he led the counterinsurgency efforts credited with stabilizing iraq   he has taken on a range of civilian roles  including with a global financial firm  academic institutions such as usc and veterans  organizations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>petraeus believes that energy  information technology  life sciences and advanced manufacturing are on the cusp of a revolution  one he believes will be fueled by u s  leadership  he shared this thesis  which he calls  the coming north american decades   with marshall mbv students on november  th  alongside a period of sustained growth in the united states  the canadian and mexican economies are also strong  while other economies are faltering </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you ll have all of this together truly changing the business landscape and the economic landscape in the united states where you re going to go out and be successful business people  taking the experience and expertise that you accrued during your time in uniform to bear dividends in the civilian world   he told the mbv students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>strategic  transformative leadership will be critical to the coming north american decades  he argued  this means getting big ideas right  communicating them throughout an organization  overseeing their implementation and course correcting when necessary </paragraph>

  <title>demystifying the mysterious world of business school rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s not every day that mba rankings end up trending on facebook  and yet yesterday that s exactly what happened  when bloomberg businessweek released its biennial ranking of full time mba programs  the results shocked many and created quite a buzz  according to bloomberg bw s most recent calculations  duke s fuqua school of business has stolen the number one spot  knocking harvard business school out of the top five for the first time in history </paragraph>
    <paragraph>just how did bloomberg bw decide which programs rose to the top and which fell from grace  as it turns out  the martin j  whitman school of management at syracuse university just a few weeks ago released an infographic that provides a clear and concise overview showcasing the rankings methodologies employed by five major publications  bloomberg bw  along with u s  news   world report  the financial times  the economist and forbes </paragraph>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>whitman s  demystifying online mba and full time mba rankings  infographic lives up to its title  unpacking the criteria each publication considers and the weight accorded to each component  for its rankings  bloomberg bw bases    percent of the score on how recruiters rate mba hires from the school  another    percent is determined by how graduating mbas judge their program  and the remaining    percent is based on faculty productivity  as measured by a tally of research published in leading journals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>u s  news   world report  for its part  considers five main factors to arrive at its ranking  with each carrying different weight in the overall calculation  student engagement accounts for    percent of the overall score  followed by admissions selectivity and peer reputation at    percent each  student services technology and faculty credentials training round out the score  weighted at      percent each  the whitman infographic goes into even greater detail  helping explain the criteria that make up each of the five pieces of the ranking methodology pie </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the financial times places huge emphasis on peer reputation     percent the overall score a school receives comes from this measure  faculty credentials and training are next  making up    percent of the score  student services and technology account for the final    percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the economist weights new career opportunities and educational experience equally  at    percent each  the remainder of that publication s methodology pie goes toward increase in salary pre  to post mba     percent  and networking potential alumni network value     percent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at forbes  meanwhile  the rankings are all about roi  it measures schools based on the five year mba gain reported by student surveys as compared to the opportunity costs and educational expenses of each given program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  those of us at clear admit encourage prospective applicants to use rankings as just one of many data points to determine which mba program might best meet their individual needs and goals  obviously  prospective applicants should be basing their decision on where to go to business school on what they consider most important  having a clearer understanding of the methodologies used should help determine which  if any  of the various business school rankings will most closely align with your own goals and expectations </paragraph>

  <title>u s  gmat percentile scores drop as asia pacific test takers dominate quant section</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>increasing numbers of prospective business school applicants from asia pacific countries such as india and china are taking the gmat and outperforming u s  students on the quantitative portion of the exam  according to a recent article in the wall street journal  as a result  though u s  students  raw scores have remained consistent over the past several years  their percentile ranking has slipped as more higher scoring international applicants take the exam </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the lower percentile rankings can seem to suggest that u s  student aptitude is declining  gmac ceo sangeet chowfla told the journal  ten years ago  a raw score of    on the quantitative section  for which scores typically range between   and     would have yielded a ranking in the   th percentile  whereas today the same raw score places a test taker in just the   th percentile </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  u s  mean raw scores have remained constant for several years at      but this is against increasing numbers of asia pacific students taking the test     percent of current gmat test takers today  up from     percent a year ago  and an increasing mean raw score among those students  rising from    to    over the last decade  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac s chowfla notes that some business schools have complained that it has become harder to interpret the test s global rankings  since u s  students  dropping percentile rankings is not correlated to their declining aptitude  in response  gmac this fall introduced a new benchmarking tool that lets admissions officers filter scores and percentile rankings by world region  country  gender and college grade point average  giving the admissions teams the ability to compare applicants against their own cohort </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sara neher  assistant dean of mba admissions at the university of virginia s darden school of business  was one of those who asked gmac for help   i need to be able to show my scholarship committee  which includes faculty  that this person is in the top   percent of test takers in his region  despite a lower percentile ranking globally  she told the journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is a clear trend in graduate management education toward creating more global programs  which has led u s  business schools to increase recruiting in south and east asia  the journal article notes   but schools also don t want to become factories for high scoring test takers from abroad   the article states </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is in great part because the gmat is far from the only measure of a good business student  leading business schools are looking for a range of factors beyond academic credentials  with leadership and communication skills playing a prominent role  many admissions officers believe that these highly valued attributes  better assessed via interviews  provide a clearer indicator of students  ability to contribute to classroom discussion and excel in the corporate recruiting process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>liz riley hargrove  associate dean for admissions at duke university s fuqua school of business  conceded to the journal that assembling a class that represents the full diversity her team is seeking increasingly means passing over some top gmat scorers in favor of lower scoring candidates who bring other strengths </paragraph>

  <title>duke s fuqua school of business tops latest bloomberg businessweek ranking</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>duke university s fuqua school of business shot to the top of bloomberg businessweek s biennial ranking of full time mba programs  released today  up from no    two years ago  in the process  the north carolina school unseated the reigning university of chicago booth school of business and pushed harvard business school  hbs  out of the top five for the first time in the history of the rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the formula bloomberg bw employs to arrive at its rankings is as follows     percent of the score is based on how recruiters rate mba hires from the school  another    percent is determined by how graduating mbas judge their program and the remaining    percent is based on faculty productivity  as measured by a tally of research published in leading journals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fuqua was propelled to the no    spot in great part due to its strong showing as part of bloomberg bw s employer survey  notably  the employer survey was expanded significantly since the last ranking cycle to include responses from       recruiters  up from     in        we changed our employer survey from the last ranking cycle to better reflect the breadth of the recruiting landscape and to collect more data on how well mbas do in the workplace   bloomberg bw said of the shift  schools surveyed were asked to rate schools on how well their graduates performed in the areas the employers deemed most important  and the responses from companies that hire large numbers of mbas were given additional weight </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students and recruiters alike praised the collaborative spirit of fuqua graduates  according to bloomberg bw  the school s ranking was also helped by the publishing steam of its faculty   which ranked second among all mba programs in intellectual capital </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chicago booth got bumped to no    this year  down from its first place spot in       as a result of fuqua s ascent to no    and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school s rise from third place to second  but more newsworthy was hbs s plummet to no     down from no    in the last ranking  student opinion was the driving factor in hbs s decline  bloomberg bw reports  in       hbs ranked no     in the student survey  and this year it slid to   th   while improvements in other schools  student scores were a factor in the decline  the perception that the school caters to elites while neglecting women and minorities also played a role   according to the bloomberg bw report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  hbs scored lowest among the top    business schools on the atmosphere it creates for women and racial and religious minorities  as for how the school ranks in terms of the climate it creates for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds  hbs students skewered the school  placing it second to last out of all     schools on the list </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like fuqua  the yale school of management made significant inroads in this year s rankings as well  securing the no    spot  up from no     in       the new haven program rose in the overall rankings thanks to stronger ratings by both students and employers this year than last  columbia business school also fared well  moving into fifth place  up from   th last cycle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for a few fun facts compiled as part of bloomberg bw s   th ranking  chew on these </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business calls it quits for mba admission blog</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>don t look for future posts on the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  mba admissions blog  in a final entry earlier this week  the school announced that it was saying goodbye to its blog  all prior blog content will remain accessible through mid december  after which prospective applicants will need to keep up with news and developments regarding stanford mba admissions via other means </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our blog has begun to resemble a tesla at a gas station   wrote admissions staffer victoria hendel de la o as part of a final post on october   th  she attributed the decline of the blog to the school s increasing reliance on other forms of social media to communicate updates  indeed  posts to the stanford mba admissions blog have grown increasingly infrequent over the past year   with the last post going up back in june </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is in contrast to other schools  such as harvard business school  mit sloan school of management and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  where admissions directors and other admissions team members have used blogs as a regular means of communicating directly with mba applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thanking those still reading the blog  hendel de la o encouraged other means of staying up to date on the school and its admissions process   complete the stay in touch form   she wrote   this is the best way to stay connected to us  because we will email you event invitations  important updates and other good stuff  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also directed prospective applicants to the school website  which provides updated admissions information and timely announcements  despite shutting down the blog  stanford gsb will also continue to have a strong social media presence  including on facebook  twitter  linkedin  google  and the mba admissions youtube playlist </paragraph>

  <title>majority of business schools now accept gre  but more applicants stick with gmat</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a whopping    percent of u s  business schools now accept the gre as an admissions test alternative to the gmat  according to a      survey by kaplan test prep  that s up from only    percent of business schools who said they accepted the gre in       when kaplan first began tracking the issue  gre acceptance by business schools has been growing steadily year over year  kaplan reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but even as more schools report accepting scores from the gre  most mba applicants are still choosing to submit scores from the more traditional gmat  more than half of the admissions officers surveyed by kaplan this year reported that only one in    or fewer applicants chose to submit gre scores instead of gmat scores  representing a slight increase from kaplan s past surveys </paragraph>
    <paragraph>seventy eight percent of mba programs report that they view scores from both tests equally  but    percent of programs say that applicants who submit gmat scores have an advantage over those who submit gre scores </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the trend line for business schools that accept the gre as an admissions alternative to the gmat has been unmistakable over the past five years   brian carlidge  executive director of pre business and pre graduate programs for kaplan test prep  said in a statement   what was once seen as an almost exotic admissions policy by business schools has become nearly ubiquitous  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>carlidge advises prospective applicants who are trying to decide which exam to take to contact their target schools to ask whether they have a preference for one exam over the other   we also advise students to take the gmat if some of the schools to which they intend on applying do not accept the gre   he added   while the gre is widely accepted  the only exam that is universally accepted is the gmat  </paragraph>

  <title>survey finds gmat integrated reasoning section scores unimportant to most b school admissions officers</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a majority of admissions officers from more than     u s  business schools surveyed this fall say that an applicant s score on the gmat s integrated reasoning section is not currently an important part of their evaluation of a prospective applicant s overall gmat score  according to kaplan test prep  which conducted the survey </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kaplan found that    percent of admissions officers surveyed this year said that performance on the ir section was not important  an uptick from    percent of those surveyed last year  that said  kaplan reports that    percent of business schools surveyed point to a low overall gmat score as  the biggest application killer   for its      survey  kaplan polled admissions officers from     business schools from across the united states  including    of the top    mba programs as ranked by u s  news   world report  gmat scores are good for five years  and the ir section launched in june       which means that many applicants in the past three years likely submitted scores from the old gmat  without the ir section   as more and more applicants submit scores from the current gmat over the next couple of years  business schools may decide that integrated reasoning performance should play a more critical role   brian carlidge  executive director of pre business and pre graduate programs for kaplan test prep  said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ir section is scored separately from the qualitative  verbal and analytical writing assessment sections of the gmat exam  which means that poor performance on this new section can t be masked by stronger performance on the other sections  this  kaplan argues  presents an advantage to those applicants who prepare for and score well on it </paragraph>
    <paragraph> similar to how not scoring well on integrated reasoning cannot be masked by good performance on other sections because it receives its own separate score  doing well on integrated reasoning can set you apart from other applicants in a positive way   carlidge says </paragraph>

    <author>Admissions Director Q&A</author>
  </authors>
  <title>admissions director q a  itziar de ros of iese</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>itziar de ros has been leading the charge since      as mba admissions director and president of the mba admissions committee at iese in barcelona  spain  she is responsible for global marketing  student selection and administration of scholarships for the iese mba class of     students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>no stranger to the school  de ros herself obtained an iese mba in       she worked as a marketing and sales consultant at dupont before returning to iese in       where she held roles in admissions  marketing and communications and development before stepping into her current role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>iese is celebrating the   th anniversary of its mba program this year  and de ros shares details about the plans to commemorate this important milestone in the interview that follows  she also highlights the school s distinctively international approach to management education  sharing new developments that have been added to the overseas module in sao paulo this year as well the opening of a new campus in germany </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  you won t want to miss her comprehensive description of the application process   including the unique in person assessment day  which includes team case work and presentations by applicants working together in groups </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  what s the single most exciting development  change or event happening at iese this coming year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>itziar de ros  there are many new developments happening at iese this year and it is really hard to narrow it down to just one  at a push  i would say the most exciting developments relate firstly to the fact that this year is a very important milestone for iese  as we are celebrating the   th anniversary of our mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>iese s full time mba began in      and was the first two year mba program in europe  as well as the first mba program in spain  in       we also launched one of the world s first entrepreneurship courses  and our program became the first bilingual mba in the world in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school s focus on internationality   which which has been present from the very beginning of the mba   can also be seen in the developments added to our overseas module in sao paulo this year   sao paulo is one of four overseas modules iese offers to second year students  alongside new york  shanghai and nairobi  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by opting to study some of their electives in another country  this is in addition to our international exchange program   students can tap into iese s extensive presence throughout the united states  latin america  asia and africa </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all our overseas modules have proven extremely popular  what i think makes the courses particularly appealing is that students do not just get a superficial look at the business culture of another country  they get a truly in depth experience and a fantastic chance to enhance their global networks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all the international electives are designed to take advantage of the locations they are taught from  classes involve extensive input and practical insights from local business communities  as well as offering participants a variety of networking and recruitment events with top companies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in this vein  the sao paulo module  which is focused on conducting business in brazil as well as opportunities throughout latin america  this year includes an in company project option  called  brazil projects   this new option delves even deeper into the country s market </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the course  participating students have to come up with innovative solutions for real life challenges that brazilian companies based in sao paulo are facing  in addition to intensive classes designed to give participants broad knowledge of the business landscape in brazil  students can also get hands on experience by working in situ on consulting projects for a number of brazilian based companies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>secondly  in addition to the in company project in brazil  our mba students can now also do an internship designed specifically for budding entrepreneurs  the iese summer entrepreneurship experience is an alternative to the traditional corporate internship taken over the summer between the first and second year of the mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it offers an exclusive platform for aspiring entrepreneurs to further their entrepreneurial projects whether they are nascent or developed  students who have participated in the summer entrepreneurship experience will also have a dedicated second year elective  called  launch   which gives them further practical guidance on starting their new business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  alongside these additions to the mba  this year iese is also opening a new campus in germany  highlighting iese s commitment to germany and to europe  the building is situated in one of munich s most iconic quarters  next to bavaria s parliament houses  and will be the first time that an international business school opens a fully functioning executive education campus in germany </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what is the one area of your program that you wish applicants knew more about </paragraph>
    <paragraph>idr  i think our work in entrepreneurship is truly exceptional  but often people are unaware when they first join us just how extensive the opportunities and support available to them at iese is  although they soon find out once they start    we have everything from investment funds to training and advice  as well as numerous activities and networking events </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for example  our investment fund  finaves  is set up solely to promote and support the new business initiatives of iese students and alumni  since its founding in      it has helped nearly    iese student entrepreneurs realize their projects  and it has invested more than   million euros that has today produced more than    million per year in terms of turnover  some world leading companies got their start from the fund </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as well as the investment fund  our entrepreneurship   innovation center  eic  helps train entrepreneurs and offers invaluable support and advice  conferences and forums are frequently organized  one such example is the european growth summit  a network of the     fastest growing companies in europe  this summit is used to share information about challenges and best practices  as well as promote common policies for companies that drive the european economy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we also offer regular events such as  breakfast with an entrepreneur   where an entrepreneur shares their experiences and lessons with mba students  and the  mba entrepreneurs open day  for candidates seeking to launch their own business ventures  which includes panel sessions and entrepreneurship activities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our mba students also organize various clubs and activities  for instance  the entrepreneurs  club organizes a series of events for students to network with successful entrepreneurs and learn from their experiences  the club also works closely with different organizations in barcelona to help students meet entrepreneurs and foster future collaborations between them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is just a small taste of what we offer at iese  i believe budding entrepreneurs will never have a better chance to get support  training and networks than when they are at business school  so it is important for students to take advantage of the opportunities available to them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as well as this  i think people sometimes do not realize how truly international and diverse an experience studying at iese is     percent of our students are international  and they represent over    nationalities  in addition  students study a north american style two year mba program  which is unusual in europe  while being exposed to the variety of different cultures and perspectives that a european learning experience can bring </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students can also study part of the mba in the united states  brazil  china and africa   and draw upon our networks and expertise in these countries  furthermore  as one of the world s most useful languages  the opportunity to learn spanish to a high level can really enhance students  career aspirations  especially bearing in mind the increasing importance of latin american emerging economies </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  walk us through the life of an application in your office from an operational standpoint  what happens between the time an applicant clicks  submit  and the time the committee offers a final decision  e g  how many  reads  does it get  how long is each  read   who reads it  does the committee convene to discuss it as a group  etc  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>idr  from an operational point of view  the application process is a long one  every year we receive around        information requests and organize more than     events around the world  iese s mission is to offer a personalized approach  so we offer all our applicants help through their admissions process even before they hit the submit button </paragraph>
    <paragraph>firstly  candidates will either request an informational interview or we give them feedback  based on their profile and the information they have given us  and advise them whether or not to apply  at this very early stage in the process we are acting as consultants  if we feel our program is not the right fit for you  we will let you know and even recommend other programs that better suit your career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once an application is submitted it goes through a first read which lasts around half an hour or so  with the application being re read and reviewed before each subsequent stage in the interview process   candidates can submit their application even if their gmat score is missing  although no decision will be made until the application is complete </paragraph>
    <paragraph>candidates who succeed from the pre committee stage are then invited to a one hour interview  this interview is always conducted by a highly trained member of the admissions team who is also an alumnus of the school  interviewers are always part of the admissions committee so they do affect the decision </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during the interview we cover all aspects of an applicant s life   yes  we will go through the application itself but also beyond it to find out who they really are as an individual  we want to learn about their accomplishments and  most importantly  their fit with iese s mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the mistakes candidates make is concentrating too much on only their professional and academic experience  when there is often something interesting about what they did when they were    or what they do after work  in the interview  we make sure these kinds of experiences are covered </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once candidates have passed the interview stage they are invited to an assessment day  attendance is not mandatory but it is highly recommended  assessments are conducted all around the world to give candidates the best chance to attend one close to their country   last year we organized them in places like new york  sao paulo  singapore  new delhi and barcelona  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we also usually organize an open day before the assessment day so people have an opportunity to familiarize themselves with our campus  experience the case method and get to know other applicants  current students and alumni </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the assessment day itself we gather a small group of people and work with them for the day  dividing people into groups of around    to    per room  in larger rooms two groups will run consecutively   we then put them into teams and give them small cases to work on  they have to conduct presentations  take questions from the audience and we also have lunch with them  it s a fantastic way for us to get to know them better and explore how they communicate  as well as their ability to work in teams  for them  it s a great opportunity to understand the business school better and the environment at iese </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after the assessment day the application is completed and goes to the admissions committee  for the candidates that have made the effort to come to the assessment we try to let them know the outcome by the week after the assessment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how does your team approach the essay portion of the application specifically  what are you looking for as you read the essays  are there common mistakes that applicants should try to avoid  one key thing they should keep in mind as they sit down to write them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>idr  the essay portion of the application process is really our introduction to a student  who is this person  how are they different  what value will they add to the school  these are the questions we want the essays to answer  the essays are the best opportunity for candidates to excel from the rest of the applicant pool   and we read them very carefully  so they should be written carefully  too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the writer s strategy should firstly be to think about those who are reading their essays  we read hundreds of essays and some are just carbon copies of each other  after reading so many applications  you can really tell if a candidate has thought sincerely about his or her answers  or if they are just using the same essay from another application  the special ones make you feel as if you are right in front of that person and having a conversation  they make you say  i want to meet this person   there is limited space  so candidates must use the essays wisely to show what they can offer the school  fundamentally  they should approach it as if they are selling a product   what sets you apart from others </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a common mistake is for people to copy and paste their essay from other applications and forget to change the name of the school  obviously  we understand that candidates apply to more than one business school  but this carelessness to review the essays does show a lack of interest that we take into account </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a good tip is for candidates to not get too bogged down detailing every single aspect of their lives and experiences like it is a checklist   as i said before  we want to know what really makes them unique and  importantly  what value they can add to our program  when we finish reading the essay we should have a clear idea about who you are  your skills and what you can contribute </paragraph>

  <title>gmac reports application volume growth for full time two year mba programs  </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the number of people applying to full time two year mba programs increased for the third consecutive year  according to recent data from the graduate management admissions council  gmac s      application trends survey  released earlier this week  showed that as two year programs enjoyed application volume gains  other graduate management programs saw flattening or decreasing numbers of applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the survey also revealed an increasingly global applicant pool  with gmat testing trends showing that more students are seeking to study outside their country of citizenship  according to gmac  these candidates make up a sizeable portion of the applicant pool for many mba and non mba graduate management programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> viewed in tandem  there is good news for both students and schools in this survey  as well as in our recent corporate recruiters survey  released in may        where four out of five companies said they planned to hire mba graduates in        sangeet chowfla  gmac president and ceo  said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most recent application trends survey found that    percent of participating full time two year mba programs reported growth  up from    percent of programs last year and just    percent in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> for schools  the rise over the last three years in two year applications is welcome   chowfla said  notably  this year was the first in the past five when a majority of programs reported increased numbers of applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph> for students  gmac s corporate recruiters survey may very well signal a change in hiring from a cost driven  recession driven organizational focus  to a growth driven focus utilizing the skills that mba programs are designed to develop   chowfla continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>full time two year mba programs in the united states reported growth from both foreign candidates and domestic candidates  sixty five percent of programs reported receiving more applications from foreign candidates this year over last  while    percent of programs reported receiving more applications from domestic candidates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gmac survey revealed mixed results for other graduate management programs  among specialized business master s  non mba  programs  those in marketing and communications  information technology  management and accounting all experienced application growth this year  but master of finance programs saw application volume decline for a third consecutive year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>application volume for professional mba programs  including part time  flexible  online and executive mbas  remained flat as compared to last year  meanwhile  six out of    business schools with one year mba programs reported declining application volume  a notable reversal of a two year trend of slowing rising or steady volume for these program formats </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>fred staudmyer  assistant dean for career management at cornell university s samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management  has more than    years of experience in executive recruitment  human resources  human capital consulting and entrepreneurship  before joining johnson in       he led the garrett sayer group  an executive search and specialty staffing firm focused on technology  financial services and consulting industries  prior to that  staudmyer held a range of other senior positions including human resources officer for ziff communications focused on human resources and recruitment and head of worldwide talent management for chase manhattan bank  he also happens to be a  dual cornellian   having obtained both his undergraduate and mba degrees from the university </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i ve always been a career geek   staudmyer confessed in a recent interview with clear admit  indeed  he knows a thing or two about helping people shape their careers  we caught up with him last week  when he generously shared some top tips for prospective mba applicants to jump start the career search before arriving at business school  read on and take note   you might even discover that some of staudmyer s advice will help you in the mba admissions process  too   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> not all business schools are alike   staudmyer reminds prospective applicants  students often place too much emphasis on rankings and geography and not enough consideration as to what school really fits them   he adds  think about what kind of experience you want to have </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if you want to be anonymous  don t want people to know you  and don t want to make a lot of friends  johnson isn t the place for you   he advises  with only     students in its two year class annually  everyone knows one another at johnson  which makes for a very different experience than a school with           students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>doing your homework before getting to business school will not only give you a leg up in your career search  it can also help you in the application process itself  of course  many students come to business school to explore potential career paths  one of the best things you can do in your application is illustrate that you have done your research  know what you want to get out of an mba and are prepared to take the steps to get you there  staudmyer says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not everyone who comes to johnson arrives knowing exactly which immersion they want to select  he stresses  in fact  the school offers a range of sessions early in the program that are designed to allow students to explore what each immersion is about  it can be overwhelming if you wait until the last minute to think about your career path  he cautions </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the more you can do in advance of your arrival  the more successful you will be   he says   time management is a key skill to be successful at business school  anything you can do before joining the family will get you started in the right direction and place you one step ahead of your peers  </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school admissions director on gmat vs  gre</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  has stated publicly for some time that it accepts both the gmat and the gre and does not prefer one over the other  in a bid to be even more transparent on the issue  hbs admissions director dee leopold devoted a recent post on her director s blog to the matter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to substantiate the claim that the school is agnostic in terms of a preference between the two tests  leopold chose to reveal exactly how many applicants submitted each type of test score  along with how many of those applicants were ultimately admitted and matriculated  while the vast majority of applicants opted to submit gmat scores  the percentage of matriculating admits as compared to total applicants broken out by test were within close range </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold did note one important change in the admissions process at hbs this year  which is that candidates will no longer have the option to submit both test scores   we need to officially verify scores and prefer to do it for only one test per candidate   leopold wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also shed some light on how her team looks at test scores  be they from the gmat or the gre   we care less about the overall score than we do about the components   she wrote   and we look at the subscores in the context of the candidate s profile  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what this means  she continued  is that the gmat or gre q score of an engineer with top grades who has been doing highly quantitative work on the job is of less consequence that that of an english major with no quantitative coursework or professional experience  the english major would be helped by a strong gmat gre quant score because it would serve to show leopold s team that he or she will be able to handle the quant work at hbs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the corollary is true too  candidates who don t have a background that demonstrates extensive practice in reading and writing may be helped by strong verbal subscores   leopold continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as a final reminder  leopold adds that every candidate does need to submit either a gmat or gre score when he or she applies   we don t accept lsats  mcats  sats or the fact that you had exceptional undergraduate grades   she wrote  unofficial scores are fine for the application  and official scores will be accepted after the deadline</paragraph>

  <title>ice bucket challenge continues its ripple through top business schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it started last week with one section challenging another at duke s fuqua school of business  ultimately leading to a school wide dousing and a challenge issued to rival schools unc kenan flagler school  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and uva s darden school  and the ice cold water just keeps flowing  as do the donations  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the challenge  of course  is the als ice bucket challenge that began going viral in late july and has amassed an incredible       million in donations to date  as compared to just      million during the same time period last year  july   th to august   th    the als association reports that it has gained     million new donors along the way </paragraph>
    <paragraph>those who are challenged are supposed to have ice water dumped over their heads and then challenge others to do the same or to make a donation to fight als within    hours  in taking up the mantle  business school classes have called upon their peers to both endure the icy shower and donate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>upon being challenged by fuqua  a group of wharton students also dumped water over their heads  and donated   extending the challenge to columbia business school  cbs   london business school and tuck school of business  giving those rival schools a week to comply </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at cbs  the class of      wrapped up its orientation activities last friday evening by accepting the challenge from wharton  several hundred students stood in front of uris hall on the university s morningside heights campus armed with brimming buckets  passing the challenge along to harvard business school  stanford graduate school of business and northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kenan flagler  which also was granted a week to comply when challenged by fuqua  responded on august   th with a videotaped compilation of multiple ice dumps involving members of both the class of      and      as well as faculty and staff  set to background music and complete with a fire hose dousing finale  at the time of the video s posting  the school reported that its community alone had raised more than    million in donations to the als association</paragraph>
    <paragraph>once the challenge has made its way through all the top schools  surely a case study or two will follow </paragraph>

  <title>financial aid at harvard business school  straight from the admissions director</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>news flash  business school  especially at top schools  costs a ton  okay  so that s not really news  more notable is the fact that top schools want to make the mba affordable  at least according to the most recent post on the director s blog at harvard business school  hbs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>earlier this week  hbs admissions director dee leopold devoted a post on her blog to the topic of financial aid  noting that hbs last year awarded     million in need based financial aid and has plans to increase that amount for the class of      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs alumni are incredibly generous and are eager to give back   especially through financial aid   to an experience that they feel was  transformational in both professional and personal ways   leopold writes  leopold stressed in her post that the hbs admissions process is need blind   although we ask for your income  this is more for us to understand different industries paths vs  anything to do with evaluation   she writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at hbs  financial aid is need based  but the school does not award full fellowships  she says  to be clear  no  student will be fully funded by hbs  underscoring the point that admissions is need blind  leopold notes that applicants do not apply for financial aid until after they receive an offer of admission  finally  hbs does have a loan program for international students which does not require a u s  co signer </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants will receive an awards package from hbs only after they have completed a financial aid application   in making our awards  we rely on a formula which takes into account whether you are single or married and can be adjusted for documented exceptional circumstances   leopold writes  noting that parental income and assets are not considered in the calculation </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we want to make hbs affordable   she writes   we want you to make post mba career decisions based on your dreams and aspirations  not a burdensome debt repayment obligation </paragraph>

  <title>student run program at tuck school of business makes getting to wall street easier</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a new student run program at dartmouth s tuck school of business seeks to help incoming students from underrepresented groups who are interested in financial services by providing career mentorship and preparation beginning even before they arrive on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>called wall street edge  wse   the program was the brainchild of a recent graduate who himself received invaluable support from across tuck that helped him meet his goal of working on wall street </paragraph>
    <paragraph> paying it forward like that is ingrained in the tuck psyche   deirdre c  o donnell  associate director for tuck s career development office and the wse adviser  said in an article about the new program on the tuck website   it is invaluable for students to explore their options before getting to school  when there will no longer be enough hours in the day  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the wse program  students benefit from professional introductions made by their peers  educational sessions and a wse trek to new york city that takes place prior to matriculation  incoming mba students can also take advantage of a network of second year students ready to serve as mentors and advocates for future employment </paragraph>
    <paragraph> for us  it means giving back to the tuck community  the vast majority of mbas are career switchers  and switching into financial services can be a daunting task   said jasper wright  who had such a positive experience in the program that he now serves as one of its co chairs   wse bridges the gap between someone s ability and the knowledge they need to take action   wright continued </paragraph>

  <title>student led program at upenn s wharton school focuses on introspection</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>ten students at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school have helped create a program designed to help encourage mbas to make time amid their studies to examine what they value in their personal and professional lives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>called  purpose  passion and principles    or the p  program for short   the student led initiative debuted last fall after roughly a year of development  participants take part in nine small group discussions held once a week  in which one student serves as a facilitator  the student facilitator directs the conversation and helps create a safe environment in which students explore topics ranging from reflections on meaningful past life experiences to what success means to them to visions of their ideal future lives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the students who helped lead development of the p  program based the first year s discussions on a book entitled springboard  launching your personal search for success  written by wharton professor g  richard shell  they also drew from other well known leadership books  including total leadership  by wharton professor stew friedman  and bill george s true north </paragraph>
    <paragraph> for me  p  was an opportunity to slow down and block out the craziness   wrote yang  sydney  liu  one of the students who helped create the program  in a recent article in the wharton magazine   more importantly  for the first time in my life  my peers challenged me to verbalize what i truly value in my professional and personal lives  and reconcile my decisions and values   liu continued   this critical examination forced me to be honest and authentic with myself a vulnerable position that i  like many others  shy away from  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to liu  news of the program traveled quickly among students at the school  and by last spring more than     had expressed interest in taking part  with only a limited number of facilitators  the program could accommodate fewer than half of those  but a new set of facilitators for next school year will double the program s capacity </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the p  buzz is spreading outside of wharton as well   liu added  p  student leaders piloted the program last semester with the penn law school and the wharton undergraduate program as well  and informal alumni groups have formed in new york city   i am excited by the program s energy and potential impact it could have on wharton s culture   lui said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>liu cautions that the program is not designed to serve up an answer to students who are struggling to figure out what their life s work should be  rather  it helps students think about their life and future careers in the context of their values and fears  to identify priorities and to learn how to make decisions that track with their personal values </paragraph>

  <title>mba recruiting now starts before classes at many top business schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>first year students at dartmouth s tuck school of business are gathering this week in san francisco for a tour of area tech firms  uva s darden school is conducting  career kickoff  meetings with two thirds of its incoming first year class and the university of michigan s ross school of business has added four days of career services programming to its orientation and this is all taking place before those mba students attend a single class </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a recent article in the wall street journal highlights these instances as evidence of several shifts in business education  including that recruiters are eager to meet with future talent earlier than ever before  mba students have a growing interest in tech careers and traditional on campus mba recruiting is no longer sufficient   the number of tech firms hiring mbas from tuck this past spring was up    percent  the journal article noted  as in years past  tuck will also host a tech trek to the bay area in december  but jonathan masland  director of the career development office at the school  says the job hunt must start much sooner than that   putting your head in the sand for the first three months  of the school year  and then popping up in december really does a disservice   he told the journal  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ross has decided to add career services programming to its orientation   including networking lunches  resume reviews and alumni panels on consulting  corporate finance  marketing and other job functions   for many of the same reasons    students think they have two years to explore what they want to do next   damian zikakis  director of career services at ross  told the journal   in fact  they have like two days   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after completing their orientation on august   th  ross first year students will head off on week long team building trips before beginning classes  recruiters will arrive on campus soon after that  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but as the journal article points out  even as employers are looking to meet with potential hires earlier and earlier and mba students are starting to explore possible careers even before their first days of business school  those same students are waiting until later in the school year to commit to job offers  at tuck  though    percent of      graduates had job offers by graduation  only    percent had accepted offers  compared to    percent at the same time in       the journal reports  </paragraph>

  <title>yale school of management implements sliding scale application fee structure</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>yale school of management  som  yesterday announced that its           mba application is now live  while the application itself features no major changes from last year s  the school is implementing a new sliding scale application fee structure designed to increase access for applicants from lower wage regions and industries or who are still in school or at the beginning of their careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most applicants will pay the standard      application fee  but applicants whose total compensation is less than         a year will pay       and those with a total compensation of less than         will pay       compensation information reported by the applicant in the application will be used to determine the fee  and yale som will verify the reported figures of all applicants who are admitted and enroll </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this change really flows from our mission of educating leaders for business and society   wrote yale som director of admissions bruce delmonico in a letter to the members of the association of international graduate admissions consultants   our goal is to provide access to mba aspirants who have the potential to have impact across all sectors and geographies  and who bring a diverse array of perspectives into our classrooms and community  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>delmonico added that the sliding scale application fee is but one of several ways the school is seeking to increase the accessibility of the mba for candidates from diverse backgrounds and from outside the united states  he noted the addition last year of video questions to the application   to complement traditional essays   as well as the elimination of the english language test requirement for non native english speakers as other examples of ways in which the school is seeking to lower the barriers for applicants from other countries </paragraph>

  <title>coding finds its way into top business school curriculums</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  plans to offer a computer programming elective within the next couple of years  and other top business schools may be moving in the same direction as more companies seek mbas with strong technical skills  according to a recent report in bloomberg businessweek </paragraph>
    <paragraph>paul gompers  who chairs the mba elective curriculum at hbs  notes that mba students there have formed coding clubs or head across to harvard s cambridge campus to take introductory computer science  but that a course specifically tailored to business students is needed at the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is the changing nature of the workforce  and this is what our graduates are going on to be doing in the next five to    to    years   gompers told bloomberg bw  increasingly  mbas are taking jobs as product managers at technology firms that require that they be technical enough themselves   as in  know how to read and write code   to work directly with the technical staff  amazon  for one  is seeking mbas who can  dive into data and be technically conversant  as product managers  amazon director of university programs miriam park told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new york university s stern school of business is also planning a course that will teach students to visualize data and understand code  economics professor david backus told bloomberg bw   i ve talked to people i know at other b schools  and they haven t heard of anything really like this  it s surprising   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while stanford graduate school of business does not offer its own coding class  mbas there have been able to take computer science courses at the university since fall       and the school last year launched a joint degree with the school of engineering that confers both an mba and an ms in computer science  bloomberg bw notes </paragraph>

  <title>ucla s anderson school of management becomes self supporting</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning today  the university of california at los angeles s anderson school of management will give up state funding and instead become self supporting  the school announced </paragraph>
    <paragraph>anderson s dean last week signed a three year deal with the university provost through which the school s full time mba program will turn down state subsidies in exchange for greater control over faculty recruitment and salary levels and the ability to determine its own tuition  among other things </paragraph>
    <paragraph>anderson hopes to make up for the loss in state funding through donations and likely higher tuitions  reports inside higher ed  in recent years  only about    percent of the business school s funding came from the state  as part of the deal  the anderson school must pay ucla on a prorated basis for overhead  including maintenance  according to inside higher ed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>anderson will continue to receive   percent of its total funding from the state   though none of it for the mba program  the university reports  two of the school s degree programs will still be state subsidized  a phd program and an undergraduate minor in accounting  the rest of its graduate programs  including the part time mba programs  were already self supporting  inside higher ed reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>then uc system president mark yudof approved the shift from state  to self supporting last summer  but final agreement wasn t reached until last week  anderson dean judy olian signed the three year contract on june   th  which included a provision ensuring that financial aid would not be impacted by the change </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the full time mba program will continue to ensure that financial aid is offered at levels at least commensurate with current levels  and with levels at other uc fulltime state supported mba programs   olian told inside higher ed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>no official word was provided from the business school on whether tuition will increase  the current charges are         for residents and         for non residents </paragraph>

  <title>mcdonough school of business admissions director reveals new essay question to clear admit</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the fall      mba application for georgetown university s mcdonough school of business will feature only one required essay  clear admit learned today as part of an interview for our admissions director q a series </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though the new application has not yet gone live   it will be available to applicants early next month   mcdonough associate dean of mba admissions shari hubert shared that her team has decided to reduce the number of required essays to just one  the question will be as follows  why you   hint  we are looking for an answer that cannot be found from research on our website   hubert called the question  purposely open ended  and said she hopes it will give applicants the flexibility to express what they want the admissions committee to know about them   not what they think the admissions committee wants to hear </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her team decided to revisit the questions used in past years  applications because it found that applicants  responses weren t revealing anything new about themselves and or were simply a regurgitation of information found on the school s website  hubert says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants will have     words in which to answer the new essay question  the application will still feature one additional optional essay question </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hubert s complete interview with clear admit will be published in this space in the coming weeks  so stay tuned </paragraph>

  <title>some business schools adopt tracking software in a bid to increase yield</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a number of top tier business schools have begun to use software to track prospective applicants  interactions with their school in an effort to gauge how interested they are in attending  according to a recent article in bloomberg businessweek  the data points   which can include whether a student has emailed admissions staff  how many admissions events they ve attended and whether they requested program information   are now included in candidate profiles alongside test scores and essay responses  bloomberg bw adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most schools report that student interest isn t a main factor in admissions decisions  but the fact that increasing numbers of schools are using the tracking programs suggest that the data gathered counts for something </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i don t know if that makes or breaks anyone s admissions decision  but when you re getting down to the nitty gritty and trying to factor in likelihood of matriculation  that s the kind of thing we look at   liz riley hargrove  fuqua s associate dean of admissions  told bloomberg bw  she noted that the tracking system fuqua uses  called talisma  helped the school increase its yield by   percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the university of chicago booth school of business and kellogg use a similar software called slate  which is marketed as a tool to  maximize your yield and build the desired class   booth dean of student recruitment and admissions kurt ahlm told bloomberg bw that it is  very rare  for the school to make an admissions based on student interest level but allowed that the measure has become one piece of the overall application </paragraph>
    <paragraph>does this mean that you should begin to flood the admissions office of your top school with dozens of calls to show your interest  not necessarily  some schools   including mit s sloan school of management and the university of california at berkeley s haas school of business   have not adopted tracking software  according to the bloomberg bw article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sloan senior director of admissions rod garcia would rather spend the tens of thousands of dollars the software costs on extra recruiting trips   i think if we go into the tracking business  we completely change the goal of the office  we become an analytics outfit rather than educators   he told bloomberg bw   i guess we still do business here the old fashioned way  and that is relationships  </paragraph>

  <title>mbas find early job offers in nontraditional sectors  gmac reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a greater percentage of mbas and other business school graduates seeking jobs in fields like technology  manufacturing and healthcare reported having early job offers than did those searching in the more traditional fields of finance and consulting  according to survey results released by the graduate management admissions council  gmac  earlier this month </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac released results from its   th annual global management education graduate survey on june  th  the global exit survey  conducted in february and march  polled       business school graduates at     universities  of those     percent had at least one early job offer  down slightly from    percent in last year s survey but still a huge improvement over the    percent who had offers in the same time period in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the time of this year s survey     percent of the graduating students were involved in a job search  and another four percent were either self employed or intending to pursue entrepreneurship at graduation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this snapshot of the early job market for business school graduates demonstrates that graduate business degrees are useful in a wide variety of careers   gregg schoenfeld  gmac survey research director  said in a statement   while demand remains strong among traditional industries  business school graduates shouldn t overlook alternative sectors  which are actively seeking mba and other business school talent   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>manufacturing and healthcare pharmaceuticals emerged as promising sectors for business school grads  with a notable    percent of students searching in these sectors reported having at least one early offer </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the technology sector  too  showed significant promise  with    percent of those seeking tech industry jobs reporting that they already had an offer in hand  of all students with early offers     percent were in the technology industry  up from   percent with early offers in tech in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>early offers in consulting made up roughly the same slice of the overall pie as in previous years  gmac reports  among all job seekers     percent of those with early job offers were in consulting  compared to    percent in       but fewer of those seeking jobs in consulting had early offers       than did those in less traditional fields  like last year  roughly a quarter of all job seekers reported early offers in the finance accounting sector  down from    percent in       here  too  the    percent of those seeking jobs in finance accounting who had early offers was lower than in the technology  manufacturing and healthcare sectors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>reported salaries for those with early job offers showed healthy gains over last year  though salaries vary widely by industry  job level and work location  the median increase in salary of those with job offers was    percent over their pre degree salary  up from a    percent increase reported last year by graduates with early job offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the job market for business school graduates has rebounded nicely since       and employers in all sectors recognize they need the business skills and acumen these graduates bring   schoenfeld said </paragraph>

    <paragraph>harvard business review recently published its first formally crowdsourced article  a piece entitled  the capitalist s dilemma  that included contributions from almost     harvard business school  hbs  alumni  the experiment was designed to helped build on a theory put forth by renowned hbs business administration professor clayton christensen about the flawed way that companies make investment decisions  which he first explored as part of a new york times article in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lead authors christensen  who is best known for his work on disruptive innovation  and derek van bever  a senior lecturer in entrepreneurial management at hbs  used a collaborative platform developed by hbs alumni  called openideo  to first define the questions they were asking and later solicit input and peer review for the piece </paragraph>
    <paragraph>colin maclay  who directs hbs s digital initiative  explained the approach in a recent article in the chronicle of higher education  the concept of crowdsourcing an article was to put ideas  out in the open  so that  one  everyone can see them  and two  people can comment on them  elaborate on them further  and help to develop them  to take what might be a kernel of an idea into something that s much more powerful   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph> part of our intention in piloting this was to demonstrate the power of this approach for other faculty at hbs and beyond   van bever said in a statement   and we really believe that  going forward  taking advantage of this capability is not only possible  it s really revolutionary in terms of the speed with which we re able to work </paragraph>
    <paragraph> but also with an alumni base as rich in experience and diversity of perspectives as ours is  you d be crazy not to tap that if you could   van bever added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the debut crowdsourced article was considered a huge success   clay has said very recently that he never wants to go back to the old method   van bever noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>digital initiative  one of seven new cross disciplinary efforts underway across hbs designed to examine and contribute to innovation and disruption in business  is now compiling a series of additional crowdsourcing challenges for the coming academic year  next up is one that will draw on alumni from hbs and harvard medical school to examine ways to improve the quality of healthcare or reduce its cost on a large scale </paragraph>

  <title>new mit sloan school of management essay question presents challenging opportunity to applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mit sloan school of management  like many top business schools  has recently released its essay questions for the upcoming application season  leaving prospective applicants and others in the admissions community buzzing about how this year s prompts require more or less from applicants than in years past  sloan put a new twist on things late last week when it revealed that its newest question invites applicants to write their own letters of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>make no mistake  these essays are not intended to take the place of actual letters of recommendation  two of which will still be required of all applicants to sloan  instead  the new essay prompt is designed to encourage applicants to reflect on themselves in a new and different way  specifically  they are asked to put themselves in their most recent supervisor s shoes and   from that manager s perspective   offer an assessment of how they themselves interact with others  stand out from others and what they would change about themselves </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sloan director of admissions dawna levenson said in a press release that the new essay question was inspired by the increasingly common business practice of having employees rate themselves and peers as part of      degree  performance reviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an article in bloomberg businessweek on the new essay noted that it could also be a  sly nod to the idea that applicants might be accustomed to writing such letters   bloomberg bw cited a recent survey by the association of international graduate admissions consultants  aigac  that found that    percent of aspiring mbas were asked by at least one recommender to draft their own letters of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while drafting your own letter or recommendation  either as part of the new sloan essay or on behalf of recommenders who request it  does offer applicants the opportunity to highlight the qualities and attributes they believe will best support their overall application  it is not without its challenges   it s hard to envision a way applicants can write about themselves from a hypothetical manager s perspective without getting cute or sounding downright smarmy   bloomberg bw notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the article  bloomberg bw consulted clear admit ceo eliot ingram for his take on the new prompt  which comes as part of a continuing effort on the part of schools to get a more authentic picture of prospective students   it s an interesting way to talk about oneself in the application  using someone else s voice   ingram told bloomberg bw   but that presents a question because it s often difficult to talk about yourself  </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school mba grad develops resource to help students record summer internship experiences</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as any business school student will tell you  the summer internship between the first and second years of an mba program can be as important a part of your ultimate career path as any class you take while on campus  and yet  amid the many pressures that confront mbas when they return to campus in the fall  it can be easy to lose sight of experiences and impressions they may have had while interning </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  thanks to an online resource developed by a recent harvard business school  hbs  graduate  current students can keep track of their goals and experiences during summer internships  creating a resource to help them gain as much from the process as possible  called life guides  the website features a summer internship guide to help mbas quickly and easily record and summarize their summer internships  enabling them to better understand what they want to do with their careers as a result </paragraph>
    <paragraph>recent hbs grad phil strazzulla created life guides   and the summer internship guide in particular   in response to his own experience as a summer intern at an investment bank after his junior year in college </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i didn t have a great summer and knew i wanted to do something else   strazzulla recalls   nonetheless  three weeks after getting back to campus in september  i was ready to sign my full time offer for said bank   he d completely forgotten how dissatisfied he d been with his internship and what his original goals had been  fortunately for strazzulla  he re read a journal entry he d written over the course of the summer before signing the offer with the bank   the    minute exercise of writing that journal entry literally saved me a few years in a job i didn t want   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>life guides  summer internship guide is free and easy to use  consisting of just a few simple steps  in may or june  registered users can briefly reflect on their goals at the start of their internships  in july  they receive an email inviting them to complete a mid summer update  recording their experiences and insights while interning  in september  they get a summary that captures what they learned </paragraph>
    <paragraph>experiences recorded as part of the summer internship guide remain completely confidential unless users choose to share them with other members of the life guides community  those who do choose to share their experiences add to a growing library where interns share their goals as well as what excites them or makes them most nervous </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re about to embark upon a summer internship  why not check out life guides today </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school s hbx online program reveals deeper debate</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as harvard business school  hbs  prepares to debut its new online education program on june   th  some of its leading professors debate the strategy behind the school s decision regarding how to respond to the rise of massive open online courses  moocs  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a new york times article yesterday explored the thinking behind hbs s online platform  hbx  which will attempt to preserve and extend the school s competitive advantage by creating online courses that  unlike moocs  replicate hbs s distinctive discussion based case method teaching  but that do not compete with the mba itself </paragraph>
    <paragraph>unlike rival schools such as stanford graduate school of business and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  which have chosen to video their professors teaching courses which they then distribute for free as moocs  hbs has developed its hbx platform in an attempt to create a new segment of business education  namely the pre mba  according to the times report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since last month  it has admitted several hundred students  mostly undergraduates  into a program called credential of readiness  or core  that includes online courses in accounting  analytics and economics intended to provide liberal arts students fluency in  the language of business   tuition for the courses  which students have nine weeks to complete  is        </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the times article called hbs s  issue of how to address online education  the school s biggest strategic decision since        when it first adopted the case study method  the approach chosen by hbs dean nitin nohria so far seems to favor the strategy advocated by famed hbs professor michael porter  who has written   a company must stay the course  even in times of upheaval  while constantly improving and extending its distinctive positioning   by seeking to replicate the case study method online while not competing with its own mba program  hbx does just that </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but  the times article points out  another famed hbs professor  clayton christensen  questions whether the hbx approach will be enough to survive the threat presented to business schools by online education  christensen recently predicted that half of the united states  universities could face bankruptcy within    years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as christensen sees it  the only way for market leaders like hbs to survive  disruptive innovation   as he has coined it  is by disrupting their existing businesses themselves  much as stanford and wharton are doing by making their mba content available for free via moocs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in some cases  christensen allows  companies have  survived disruption  but in every case they set up an independent business unit that let people learn how to play ball in the new game   he told the times  which hbs hasn t done  hbx is too closely tied to the business school  christensen argues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nohria and others believe that disruptive innovation may indeed be the demise of second  and third tier business schools  but that hbs s brand  network and distinctive case study method would protect it   i do not believe our mba program is at risk   he told the times  adding that he doesn t believe that disruption is always all or nothing   in the music business  all record stores are gone   he said  while in retailing   it s not like amazon has eliminated everything  after those debates  my feeling was that we re going to be more in that category  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the same time  hbx   along with its    full time staff members and proprietary platform that provides a live forum that allows a professor to stand in a pit before an audience of digital screens with the live images and voices of geographically dispersed participants   provides a little insurance to the business school in the event that his assumptions prove wrong </paragraph>

  <title>better storytelling leads to soaring application volume at unc s kenan flagler business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the kenan flagler business school at the university of north carolina at chapel hill saw the number of applicants to its mba program increase    percent this year over last  growth the school attributes to better  storytelling  and branding  according to a report in triangle business journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>unc as a whole has been working to increase brand recognition  and the increase in applicant volume at the business school is in part a result of these branding efforts  sridhar balasubramanian  associate dean for the mba program  told the triangle business journal    traditionally that  strengthened brand  has been a weakness for us  so it s been something we have worked to address   balasubramanian said   that includes things like crystallizing the brand message  formalizing brand elements and also being consistent with advertising about who we are  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the triangle business journal report  kenan flagler saw upticks in the number of applicants across the board  with increases from both domestic and international applicants and both women and men </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the triangle business journal notes that kenan flagler does not expect to increase the size of its class in response to the surge in applicants  but rather to focus even more on quality  the school also does not intend to increase its admissions staff to contend with the larger applicant pool </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our staff just works very  very hard to get through the numbers   balasubramanian told the triangle business journal   they re delighted to have larger numbers  so they ve been very focused on that   he allowed that the staff is always looking for ways to streamline applications in an effort to obtain the most diagnostic information possible about each student  not necessarily the greatest quantity of information </paragraph>

  <title>upenn study of wharton moocs suggest they don t threaten traditional mba programs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a university of pennsylvania study of massive open online courses  moocs  offered by its wharton school reveals the online courses present an opportunity for business schools to expand to under served markets rather than a threat to their traditional business programs  the study findings were published today in the harvard business review </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the study   led by researchers ezekiel emanuel  penn s vice provost for global initiatives  gayle christensen  executive director of penn global  and brandon alcorn  penn global project manager   is the first of its kind to focus specifically on moocs offered by a business school  the researchers surveyed more than         students enrolled in nine moocs offered by wharton </paragraph>
    <paragraph>contrary to some concerns about moocs   namely  that by offering course content for free business schools risk losing paying applicants to their flagship programs   the penn researchers found that the courses are instead helping business schools reach new student populations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the researchers identified three main new student populations registering for wharton moocs  students from outside the united states  especially those in developing countries  foreign born americans  and under represented american minorities  indeed     percent of survey respondents came from outside the u s   with about    percent from developing countries  of u s  individuals enrolled in the wharton moocs     percent are foreign born  finally     percent of wharton s american mooc students are under represented minorities  the survey found </paragraph>
    <paragraph>by comparison  the wharton two year mba program counts only    percent of its students as foreign and only      percent of its u s  population as foreign born  of all students enrolled in traditional mba programs at nine of the top u s  business schools  just    percent are under represented minorities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the penn study on wharton moocs also revealed that completing an online course is not the most important outcome for the majority of the students who take them  a finding researchers took to imply that the business model some schools are adopting   of charging for certificates of completion   may not be the smartest choice </paragraph>

  <title>brown university to begin issuing emba degree as part of joint program with ie business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the governing body of brown university voted earlier this month to begin issuing a master s in business administration for the first time   to graduates of a collaborative    month executive mba program the school has offered since      with madrid s ie business school  according to a report in bloomberg businessweek </paragraph>
    <paragraph>previously  graduates of the program received a degree only from the spanish school  in conferring its own degree  brown now leaves princeton as the only school among the ivy league to not issue an mba degree of any sort </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the brown university corporation  which governs the rhode island university  approved a proposal presented to the faculty earlier this year to beginning issues its own degree to students who complete the emba program  which brown hopes will lead more students to apply to the program  according to the bloomberg bw article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ie brown emba program is an unconventional one   bloomberg bw called it  an aardvark among emba programs    that provides courses ranging from corporate strategy and supply chain management to  the shared history of slavery and capitalism   it has attracted a diverse group of applicants by promising to broaden their view of the world with offerings beyond the accounting  marketing  and quantitative courses often associated with traditional mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is stuff that mbas aren t hearing about in other places   seth rockman  brown associate professor of history  told bloomberg bw  rockman teaches the course on slavery and capitalism  which leads students to examine the mobilization of public and private capital and accounting principles that developed as part of slave trading businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the vast majority of our current  students  and alumni would not have opted for an mba if not for us   ulrike klaussner  the madrid based executive director for the ie brown program  told bloomberg bw  adding that the most recent graduating class included    different nationalities among its    students  twice as many of whom worked in public service as financial services </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brown does not have plans to build a business school from scratch  karen sibley  dean of the school of professional studies at brown  told bloomberg bw  instead  it plans to continuing adding executive degree programs in areas in which it already has expertise  it currently features a master s degree for health care executives and has plans to roll out executive master s for leaders in engineering and cybersecurity  sibley called the programs  a very sensible attempt to leverage the talents and capacities that we already have  </paragraph>

  <title>what a harvard business school mba doesn t teach you</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with just days to go before he graduates  harvard business school  hbs  student ben faw compiled a list of things he didn t learn at hbs into a compelling infographic that quickly became one of the most popular blog posts on linkedin earlier this week  since clear admit readers often have hbs in their sights  we thought we d share some of faw s insights here </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an army combat veteran  faw had the idea to dispel some of the misconceptions he thinks people sometimes have about the mba  and especially about the hbs mba  with the assistance of fellow classmates and a local startup  he helped create an informative post to tackle the myths one by one </paragraph>
    <paragraph>contrary to what many may believe about hbs  people matter more than money  faw writes   prior to attending business school  i was warned that hbs was filled with people willing to do anything to make inordinate amounts of money and that it is not the place to meet or build true friendships   his experience has shown just the opposite   i will graduate from harvard business school in a few days with many authentic relationships that have already been incredibly rewarding and made me a better version of myself  these amazing bonds are priceless and define my experience here   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another popular misconception is that the only way to make an impact is by heading to wall street  faw cites hbs data on placement locations for recent graduates to show that  in fact  hbs graduates are heading to the west coast in ever greater numbers and are taking jobs in product management  marketing  sales and general management   in a dramatic shift versus a decade ago  technology jobs are just as sought as roles in finance   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>think more is better  think again  says faw  one of the things hbs did teach him is that he can t have everything  at hbs   and indeed at most top business schools   students will be exposed to hundreds of classmates who would all be valuable additions to their network  but  pretending to get to know them all is foolhardy  says faw   we have to invest   fully and deeply   in the few people and things that make us the happiest  only then can we make a truly meaningful impact as future business leaders   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these are just a few of the takeaways faw shares from his time at hbs  read his complete post   what my mba at harvard did not teach me  </paragraph>

  <title>the soaring price of business school networking</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a new york times article this weekend examined the growing number of trips and other  lifestyle experiences  that now compete with academic ones as part of the mba program at many leading business schools  even those that don t offer any form of academic credit can be viewed as valuable networking opportunities that can help position students for jobs upon graduation worth their steep price tags in the eyes of some </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as an example  the times story lead with a february ski trip to park city  utah  that about a third of the mba class from the university of texas as austin s mccombs school of business went on  the three day trip  planned by a student run group called the graduate business adventure team  was advertised to cost about         though final costs may have ended up higher sean pool  who is financing his mba degree largely through student loans  opted to sit out the ski trip  though he acknowledge that he realized that in doing so he might be missing an opportunity to bond with fellow students   cliques at mccombs are generally diverse and accepting  but there is to some degree a socioeconomic element to the way cliques fall out  particularly for groups who have the financial means to travel for pleasure several weekends each semester   pool told the times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the increasingly prevalent trips offered as part of the mba take many different forms  from purely leisure to career focused and curricular travel  the latter  because it is for educational purposes and students receive credit as part of a class for it  can be financed with student loans  the times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>examples of career focused trips that don t carry academic credit include the career treks offered at many leading schools  usually with a focus on a particular industry like private equity  consulting or banking or a particular geography like san francisco or chicago  often  these give participating students an opportunity tour and meet with companies  sometimes providing a valuable leg up in the job search process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ming min hui  a    year old first year student at harvard business school  went on just such a trip  called westrek  over her january break  sponsored by the techmedia club  westrek is designed to give students an insider s look at the tech industry in the bay area  and hui and close to     of her classmates visited    companies in the course of the three day trip  including google  facebook  tesla and several venture capital firms  the times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>already in her first year  hui has been on eight such not for credit trips  including hiking the inca trail in peru over spring break   an m b a  is very different from a law or medical degree  the m b a  is designed for networking reasons   she told the times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business professor jeffrey pfeffer acknowledges that the role of trips has changes significantly since he started teaching    years ago   the social aspects of business school have become more prominent over the last decade   there is no doubt about that   he told the times   students go to vegas and take over a southwest airlines plane  they go to the sundance movie festival  and some of them rent houses on lake tahoe  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even students who don t have the financial means to take part find often a way because they view the bonding opportunities to be worth it  some accrue credit card debt  and others take on jobs to fund the trips believing that doing so will help them land lucrative jobs later </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one such student  samantha joseph  who graduated from the mit sloan school of management in       worked as a teaching assistant to help fund trips to nine countries during business school  most of them not for credit   if you want to be a global leader in any industry  it s important to see how the business world works and runs in other countries   joseph told the times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mccombs student pool  who has chosen to focus his time and resources on other things  maintains that while they may yield connections  the trips are not essential to success at business school  proof positive  he has forgone the expensive trips and nonetheless secured a summer internship at an investment bank   networking is great  but it s not the no    reason to come to business school   he told the times   and if you are spending a lot of time  money or resources doing it  you are probably doing it all wrong  </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>community service projects led by mba students from cornell s samuel johnson graduate school of business were recognized as part of a recent symposium highlighting leadership through service  ithaca mayor svante myrick  a      cornell graduate  praised students from his alma mater for seizing opportunities to volunteer in the community </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i believe that young people like you have the skills that we need in the nonprofit sector that we are not getting   myrick said   you have the energy  the creativity  and the moral authority to make change  and it s those things   not experience   that matter  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>myrick  who was elected ithaca s mayor at the age of     could be considered a poster child for his own message  as he told the audience at the second annual leadership through service symposium last month  it was a community service project   tutoring kids downtown   that led to his attendance at city council meetings and  ultimately  his getting hooked on government service </paragraph>
    <paragraph>examples of community service were definitely not in short supply at this year s symposium  six johnson student led projects were recognized </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one such project was the community impact club s annual spring action  which raised almost         for four area nonprofits  cindy nham  mba      the club s vice president for fundraising  was overwhelmed by students  response   on the very last day before the auction  i had    students reach out to me to ask how they could contribute   she said  adding that she finally had to cut people off and say they couldn t accept any more donations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another was a study conducted by jonathan ambrose  mba      to analyze incubators from around the country and help create an operating budget for a new ithaca incubator  ambrose also recommended key services the incubator should offer to attract entrepreneurs when it opens downtown this summer </paragraph>
    <paragraph> entrepreneurship is really about opportunity   ambrose points out   i think there are so many people in this region who are trying to create and trying to grow businesses  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a third student led project involved a benchmarking study for the tompkins county public library  vikash khanna  mba      and three other students compared the local library to    peer libraries in college towns and cities in the northeast and then provided recommendations for how the library could increase funding and improve services </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the project overall has been a wonderful experience   khanna said   it taught me a great deal about managing relationships and managing expectations  but more fundamentally about giving back to the community  </paragraph>

  <title>economist ranks top    north american mba programs  chicago booth leads</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in case you missed it  the economist earlier this week broke out the top    north american full time mba programs  as a follow up to its global ranking  as an introduction to this north american specific list  the economist calls america the  spiritual home of the mba   noting that the first mba was offered there more than a century ago and that today  u s  schools dominate the publication s global ranking   eight of the top    business schools in the worldwide ranking are located in u s  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the top    north american mba programs  the university of chicago s booth school of business claimed the top spot  as it did in the global rankings   among the other highest ranking north american schools were several prestigious u s  names  including dartmouth s tuck school of business  harvard business school  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  mit sloan school of management and stanford graduate school of business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the highest ranked canadian mba program made the list at number     york university in ontario  it is the only non u s  school in the north american top    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the economist report attributes american schools  size and history as among their big advantages   they help them achieve the financial clout to attract the best professors and students and to build the finest facilities   read the economist  noting that every one of the     professors who teach wharton s       mba students holds a phd   meanwhile  huge endowments  which are often used to subsidize tuition  help them attract the brightest students   the report added  noting that of the    schools at which the average gmat score is over         are american </paragraph>
    <paragraph>career services at u s  schools also received stellar marks from the economist survey respondents   chicago  tuck  virginia and columbia all rank in our global top five schools when it comes to opening new career opportunities   reports the economist  having said that  graduates from north american programs typically earn a little less than european or australian counterparts  most often because they have less work experience before starting the mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but just as they lead in many other categories  american schools also have the highest price tags   something not as universally celebrated as an advantage  the economist notes </paragraph>

  <title>chicago booth school of business transfers mba application review from current students to admissions staffers</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning with the           application season  current students at the university of chicago booth school of business will no longer read the applications of prospective candidates for the school s mba program  instead  admissions staff will assume responsibility for reading all files  a shift school administrators hope will both provide for more consistent evaluations and free up the student reviewers to interact with prospective members of the booth community in more meaningful ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the consistent read piece is only a small part of why we have changed the ga role   stacey kole  deputy dean of the full time mba program  told poest quants   the driving force behind the change in our graduate fellows program is to further engage students as ambassadors  providing meaningful connections between our students and those not yet in our community  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the university of pennsylvania s wharton school made a similar change two years ago  discontinuing the use of mba students as first readers  at chicago booth  the reaction to the change by this year s student readers was initially mixed  but they were engaged in discourse with the admissions staff before final changes were presented to the dean for approval  according to an opinion piece by one of the students in chicago business  the school s student newspaper </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the changes are nuanced and far reaching  the driving force being to increase the interaction between booth students and applicants via on campus programs  communication  branding and interviewing   wrote vladimir andonov  a class of      mba at booth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>until now  booth applications were assigned to mba students known as admissions fellows  chosen for their involvement as first year students in giving tours and running admit weekends and their demonstrated passion for the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the p q report  fellows would be assigned as many as    to    files a week in peak periods  and they would be tasked with grading each of six elements  test scores  academics  work experience  extracurricular activities  essays and recommendations  on a scale of one to six  they would also provide an overall score for the application as well as a subjective  fit to booth  score </paragraph>
    <paragraph>starting later this year  that responsibility will be handled entirely by admissions staffers  p q reports </paragraph>

  <title>johnson graduate school of management to change core curriculum</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>mba students will find a new core curriculum that places greater focus on leadership and modeling and analytics when they arrive on campus at the samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management in the fall  planned changes to the core also include shifting the timing of the courses to better accommodate an increasingly intense recruiting environment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>johnson s core has remained relatively unchanged for the past decade  though individual course are constantly adjusted to reflect feedback gathered from students  alumni and recruiters  the changes planned for next year are the result of a systematic reevaluation of the entire curriculum undertaken by the administration  they were outlined in a recent article by jeffery gordon  mba      in the cornell business journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>johnson associate dean douglas stayman chaired the review committee  which included both faculty and staff members  the review process took place over three years and included focus groups with students and alumni as well as a survey sent to more than a thousand recruiters  students and alumni  gordon reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the purpose of the survey was to gauge how effectively the existing johnson curriculum met the needs of each of these constituencies  respondents were asked to benchmark johnson students and alumni against graduates from other business schools on a range of skills and then indicate how important they felt those skills were in today s workplace  according to stayman  feedback was consistent across all three groups and defined several key areas of improvement for the school  chief among them being leadership and communication  modeling  analytical skills and better preparation for internship interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the new core curriculum seeks to address each of these issues   writes gordon   the most important change is to the way johnson teaches leadership  which the new core will address in a more systematic fashion  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  leadership development will be a part of mba students  full two years at johnson  beginning with a course called  leading teams  in august prior to the first year  continuing with  critical and strategic thinking  in the second half of the fall semester  and culminating with  principled leadership  in the first half of the fall in the second year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to address the call for greater focus on modeling and analytics  the existing  statistics  course will be redesigned into a course tentatively called  data analytics and modeling   to be taught by professor bill schmidt </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  because the recruiting process at business schools has changed significantly over the past ten years  the timing of the core courses has been adjusted to reflect the fact that recruiting for internships now begins much closer to the start of the year   many students and alumni complained about the course load during the heavy internship recruiting season  and many recruiters commentated that johnson students were underprepared for their interviews   gordon writes  recognizing this   critical and strategic thinking  is now scheduled for the fall semester to help students be better prepared for interviews  meanwhile  the total number of credit hours in the second half of the fall semester will be reduced from     to      to lessen the workload when recruiting is in full swing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the core courses have likewise been adjusted in the spring semester   data analytics and modeling  and  operations  will now run concurrently over the course of the entire spring semester  but each course will only be    weeks long  to provide more time for recruiting and end of semester projects  core classes will not be held the first two or last two weeks of the semester </paragraph>

  <title>tax deductions for mba costs </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>we all know the cost of an mba is not insignificant  beyond discussion of whether or not the investment is worth it  what if you could deduct the costs as a business expense  can you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a recent marketwatch article delved into precisely that question  answering with a resounding  depends  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the general rule regarding business deductions for educational expenses says that as long as you incur the costs to maintain or improve skills used in your current job or self employed business  you can deduct the costs as a business expense </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the marketwatch piece reports that the irs has always argued that an mba degree automatically trains you for a new profession  preventing you from deducting those costs as unreimbursed employee business expenses or as self employed business expenses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but marketwatch goes on to point out that the tax court takes a different position   it says business deductions are allowed if the mba training maintains or improves skills used in your current job  profession or business   writes marketwatch   for example  if you are a marketing professional  i think you can clearly deduct mba costs under this standard   the article continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that said  if the mba courses are taken before or shortly after you are hired in order to meet educational requirements for the job  then you can t claim tax deductions for mba costs  likewise  you cannot deduct the cost of your mba if it trains you for a new profession </paragraph>
    <paragraph>marketwatch also provides the following guidance </paragraph>
    <paragraph> non business credit  mba costs are eligible for the non business lifetime learning tax credit  which can be worth up to        a year under the rules explained earlier </paragraph>
    <paragraph> non business deduction  you may be eligible to claim the non business deduction for up to        or        of mba tuition and related fees on page   of form      under the rules explained earlier  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit is in no way offering tax advice  but if you are interested in learning more about potential deductions you might be eligible for with regard to the cost of an mba  you might start by reading the complete marketwatch piece and follow up with a consultation with a tax accountant </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>the deans of more than a dozen leading business schools took leave from their campuses yesterday to head to the white house  where they met with senior advisors preparing for the white house summit on working families  the white house is seeking input from a range of stakeholders to identify best practices to develop workplaces that better meet the needs of women and working families </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we did not think this goal could be achieved without thinking of the business leaders of tomorrow  and that is why today  we met with a group of deans from our nation s leading business schools to discuss best practices for business schools that can better prepare their students for the increasing importance of women in the labor force and the prevalence of employees with families where all parents work   read a post on the white house blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the white  house pointed out that though women today are more likely to graduate from college and enter formally male dominated professions  they still confront multiple challenges as they do so  chief among these is that they start their careers making less than their male counterparts  and the pay gap increases over the course of their careers  the white house blog cited one study of mba graduates from a leading institution that found that women earned     k on average when they graduated and     k nine years later  while men earn     k at graduation and     k after nine years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of yesterday s meeting  deans from    schools   including harvard business school  uc berkeley s haas school of business  cornell s johnson graduate school of management  yale school of management and uva s darden school of business   discussed the issue of pay inequality  the need for more mentorship opportunities for women  and the need for greater flexibility in the workplace to prevent women from being penalized due to career interruptions such as motherhood  the business school deans also shared valuable insights regarding leadership  retention rates  business school culture and the timing of business school in the lifecycle </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in order to ensure business practices that fully utilize a   st century workforce  it is important for business school deans to update their curriculum and practices to fully reflect the importance of women and working families in our labor market   read the white house blog post  white house advisors will work in the weeks ahead to compile best practices  which they will then call on an even larger group of business schools to sign on to </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan mbas scope out leading seattle firms as part of annual tech trek</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>after returning from a recent mit sloan tech trek to seattle  a first year mba student shared highlights in a recent article on geekwire  jarek langer  mba       vice president of treks for the technology club at sloan  detailed his recent trek  which included visits to amazon  microsoft and groupon  though all three companies had already given formal presentations on mit s campus  visits to their campuses provided valuable insights into company culture and more  langer writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at microsoft  trek participants got a tour of the campus as well as a chance to convene with mit sloan alumni now working there   we d heard about its giant campus  but it was incredible to experience the scale of it in person   langer writes  he noted that conversations with alumni gave him a sense of the importance of collaboration at microsoft  as well as a high degree of ownership over work  with little micromanagement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>next was a visit to groupon  where trek participants got to learn about a shift in the company s business model toward a greater focus on local and mobile  particularly interested in the intersection between tech and retail  langer noted that what he learned at groupon makes him plan to keep the company in his sights </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the trek s final company visit was to amazon  where a panel filled with more sloan alumni helped describe what it s like to work there  as well as what seattle living is all about   one thing that stood out for me was how employees don t use powerpoint very much   writes langer   instead  they use thoroughly written white papers that explore issues in depth   this observation was in keeping with a company known for its analytic depth and attention to detail  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rounding out the trek was a visit to venture capital firm madrona venture group  with a panel filled by senior people from several of its startups  all interested in hiring interns   it was clear from our discussion with these startups that analytics is playing a significantly greater role in business models   langer writes   there are a lot of opportunities to apply analytics in various settings and industries  which is great news for students from mit sloan where big data is an area of great interest and strong expertise  </paragraph>

  <title>mba vs  msx at stanford graduate school of business </title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>you know about the two year  full time mba program at stanford graduate school of business  gsb   but did you know the school also offer a second masters degree focused on general management  stanford s msx program offers a master of science in management degree  a one year  full time program geared toward experienced professionals with at least eight years in the work force </paragraph>
    <paragraph>which program is right for you depends on a range of factors  both are full time and focus on general management  and both are taught by stanford gsb faculty and feature a range of elective course offerings  students in either program have full access to stanford s gsb centers  courses throughout stanford university  university wide institutes and student clubs  events and social activities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the msx core curriculum  though  was designed with more experienced managers in mind  to this end  its leadership courses focus more on executive management development  and a specialized team in the gsb career management center provides support to msx students  who are further along in their careers and therefore generally more focused in their professional goals  the cohort in the msx program is significantly smaller than the mba class   around    students as compared to around     mba students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as far as the admissions process is concerned  both programs are seeking candidates with superior intellectual aptitude and an appetite for learning  as well as demonstrated leadership potential  but the msx program places greater emphasis on experience and requires at least   years of prior work experience  the mba program  in contrast  has no minimum work experience requirement and takes a broader view of candidates  leadership potential </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the msx program is also looking for candidates to demonstrate a greater clarity of purpose as part of the admissions process   reflected in terms of professional direction  ambitious goals and level of self awareness  the mba program will look more closely at candidates  personal qualities and what they might contribute to the overall class   personal qualities and contributions may include your experiences  beliefs  passions  dreams  and goals   read a recent post on the stanford mba admissions blog </paragraph>

  <title>choosy mba students at top schools reject job offers  hold out for dream jobs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>some students at top mba programs are rejecting employment offers and choosing to graduate without a job in hand  holding out for positions at technology firms and startups  which hire later than more traditional finance and consulting companies  according to a wall street journal report yesterday </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i m not nervous   ellen cory  a second year student at dartmouth s tuck school of business who has turned down several job offers  told the journal   i m not behind for the type of position i m trying to get  i ve seen classmates get a lot of great jobs  and i have confidence that i will be able to find a job that satisfies me   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>cory s attitude  which according to the journal report is one shared by many students  reflects a big change from just a few years ago  when students tried to lock in their postgraduation plans as early in the year as they could  now  with greater confidence in their own abilities and more optimism about the job market  students are holding out for the perfect job  even if it means graduating without a precise employment plan in place </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the journal article notes that this year s information is hard to quantify because most business schools don t track job placement until graduation but added that interviews with current mba students and career services officers show that more and more students are waiting for just in time spring hiring  particularly at tech firms and startups  which can t predict hiring needs as far out and so wait longer to extend offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the current student population is definitely willing to wait for the right opportunity   jennifer bridge  director of recruiting at the university of california at berkeley s haas school of business  told the journal  last year at haas  roughly    percent of graduates had job offers at graduation  but only    percent had accepted offers  the differential between offers and acceptances has historically been closer to   percent  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as students grow choosier   and demonstrate more patience   in the job search  career services officers are changing their strategies as well  even coaching students in some instances to wait for the best offer  the journal reports  a tuck survey of      graduates found that students who accepted jobs after graduation reported being more satisfied than those who did so before graduation </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit bullish on new wharton dean</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>as we reported last week  geoffrey garrett has been named to replace outgoing dean tom robertson and will take the helm on july  st  so what s clear admit s take on this new dean  we welcome what we believe to be a strong candidate and wish him well in his new role </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a political economist with a pacific rim orientation but clear u s  interests as well  we think garrett will make a good fit for wharton on several levels  he brings an understanding of the intersection between business and politics that will lend itself well to wharton s focus on globalization and on preparing its graduates to understand how business is done internationally </paragraph>
    <paragraph>his appreciation of collaboration and innovation   consistent with two other main points of focus at wharton   were also among the things that made him a front runner in the search process  the school noted in the press release announcing his appointment  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while dean of the australian school of business at the university of new south wales  unsw   garrett helped to create a university wide innovation center bringing together faculty and students from business  design  engineering and science   his approach to scholarship and discovery fits perfectly with penn s commitment to integrating knowledge across disciplines   penn provost vincent price said in a statement  indeed  wharton s commitment to fostering collaboration is evident even in its mba interview process  which now incorporates a group exercise designed to assess how effectively candidates work together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>garrett also brings a nice combination of academic and practical experience to the role  which should appeal to various constituents at wharton  in addition to serving as professor of business and dean of unsw  dean of the university of sydney business school and in numerous other academic roles  he was also the founding ceo of the university of sydney s united states studies center and the president of the pacific council on international policy in los angeles  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  he understands that the school is facing pressures from globalization and technology and brings a distinct point of view on how to address them   like other sectors  globalization and technological change are poised to transform business education   garrett said in a statement   i have no doubt wharton will be in the vanguard of this transformation in america and around the world  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in our conversations with them in the days immediately following the announcement  officials at wharton expressed enthusiasm about the choice  and we echo that enthusiasm  we think geoff garrett is a good candidate to lead wharton  and we look forward to seeing how the school evolves under his guidance </paragraph>

  <title>fewer grads from european mba programs are heading into finance</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>far fewer mba students from europe s top business schools are choosing careers in finance than they have in the past  opting instead for jobs at facebook  amazon and other tech firms  according to a recent report in the financial news </paragraph>
    <paragraph>london business school  lbs   cambridge s judge business school  oxford s said business school  insead and hec paris all report significant drops in the number of mbas who have accepted full time roles and internships at finance firms as the heaviest portion of the annual recruiting season comes to an end </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at lbs     percent of the class has accepted finance positions  down from    percent in      and       at judge and said  the percentage heading into investment banking has dropped from more than a third of the class to about a quarter since       and at insead  employment figures for the class of      reveal that only    of graduates went into finance  half the      figure </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so where are students going instead   some students are looking to work in the buyside more generally   private equity is highly sought after   and outside finance  the technology sector has been attracting quite a lot of candidates and strategy consulting firms also   christelle cuenin  assistant director of the career development centre at insead  told the financial news  while there is still a committed group going into investment banking  she added  that group is shrinking </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the financial news attributes the shift to changes in supply and demand  noting that fewer mbas find finance as alluring as they used to  concerned by the long hours and shrinking paychecks associated with careers in finance  mbas today are looking elsewhere  and often toward technology firms </paragraph>
    <paragraph>amazon is already the top recruiter at lbs and said and is projected to be the top recruiter for the graduating class of      at hec  according to the financial news report  and smaller tech firms are also now competing with the banks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>against this backdrop  some banks are also reducing their recruiting efforts on european campuses   there is a big focus on u s  schools   a recruiter at a top investment bank told the financial news   if schools in europe are feeling as though there s a retreat  it may just be that some banks are reducing efforts on certain campuses in europe  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several lbs students interviewed for the financial news article cited poor work life balance as a deterrent to heading into finance  asked if he would work at a bank when he graduates  marco duso said this   no   you work too hard for not enough money and i care too much about my lifestyle  the big banks are not implementing changes to make the lifestyle sustainable   he is headed instead to boston consulting group </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but those who answered that they would work at a bank upon graduation said they weren t worried about the long hours  adding that they might move after a few years to a job that would afford better work life balance </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business revokes mba degree from convicted inside trader</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  yesterday confirmed that  for the first time ever  it has stripped a graduate of his mba degree because he was admitted to the program under  false pretenses   the wall street journal reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the graduate in question   former sac capital advisors employee mathew martoma  who completed his mba in        was convicted last month of insider trading charges   martoma does not have a stanford mba   stanford gsb spokesperson barbara buell confirmed in a separate report by poetsandquants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the journal article  martoma s admission to stanford s mba program was rescinded  effectively nullifying the degree he was conferred more than a decade ago  the move came not because of his conviction  but because he failed to disclose on his application to stanford gsb that he had previously been booted from harvard law school for falsifying his grade transcript and sending the forged document to federal judges when seeking a job  that detail emerged as part of the unsealing of documents in advance of his february trial </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martoma had changed his name by the time he applied to stanford gsb two years later and covered up the fact that he had been dismissed from harvard  stanford s decision to revoke martoma s admission indicated that then director of stanford mba admissions marie mookini did not know that he had been expelled </paragraph>
    <paragraph> what makes this possible is not that he was a convicted felon  but that he was admitted under false pretenses   a faculty member told the journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to multiple reports  stanford sent martoma a letter last month seeking an explanation about statements he made on his original mba application  he was give a two week deadline to respond  and after a request from his lawyers  he was also granted a two week extension  the extension ran out on friday  with no response from martoma s legal team </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gsb  citing privacy laws  has declined to comment on martoma s academic record   federal law  ferpa  prohibits stanford from discussing the specific academic status of a former student   spokesperson buell told poetsandquants   however  we take very seriously any violation of the integrity of our admissions process   she said  adding that the school has policies in place for revoking degrees or acceptance offers if a student is found to have gained admission through false pretenses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to no longer having an mba  martoma faces up to    years in prison for each of two counts of securities fraud  as well as up to five years for a conspiracy charge  his sentencing is scheduled for june </paragraph>

  <title>ucla anderson school of management s approach to diversity recruiting in mba admissions</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the recruitment of african american students and other traditionally underrepresented minorities is a challenge facing admissions directors at leading mba programs  according to a recent post on the ucla anderson school of management blog </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is an issue facing all of the best programs   says alex lawrence  anderson assistant dean of admissions   all of the admissions directors talk about it  it s reality   the relatively low admission numbers of black students in anderson s full time school is a problem that stems from the fact that there are only a limited number of candidates that qualify for the top schools  he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the pipeline is limited   he says  adding that this is exacerbated by the fact that all the top mba programs are recruiting from the same limited pool of qualified diverse candidates  says lawrence   the question becomes  do you lower your  admission  standards  or should you be proactive to improve the number of students who meet your standards  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lowering admissions standards is not the answer lawrence and his team choose  instead  they are working with a number of programs and organizations focused on improving diversity recruiting at the mba level by improving opportunities available to diverse students well before they even consider business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the riordan programs  founded by former los angeles mayor richard riordan nearly three decades ago  include a number of initiatives focused on high school students  recent college graduates and first generation college students who are interested in business or careers in management  lawrence knows the programs well  since he led them before transferring to admissions  anderson s full time class of      includes more riordan alumni than any class before it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>anderson is also a member school within the consortium for graduate study in management  a nonprofit organization devoted to increasing diversity and inclusion in american business  the number of consortium recruits entering the ucla anderson mba program is also at a record high  anderson likewise works closely with the forte foundation and the national society of hispanic mbas  organizations that focus on recruiting women and hispanic students  respectively </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s important for us to leverage these relationships   lawrence says   five to    years down the road  the discussion will change  because there won t be as few candidates as there are today   lawrence says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the passage of proposition     by california voters means that anderson may not consider race for admissions purposes  but lawrence assure minority candidates that they will find at anderson a diverse and welcoming community within a diverse city </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>a fund launched by yale university last fall has awarded its first          to a start up launched by yale school of management  som  students with a unique product for treating acid reflux </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the yale entrepreneurship institute  yei  innovation fund was launched in september      by yale university  connecticut innovations and first niagara bank to provide early stage funds to promising start ups coming out of yei  startup firm eli nutrition  inc   maker of a new antacid called tummyzen  snagged the first          investment  the school announced this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are thrilled that eli nutrition was chosen for investment from the yei innovation fund   erika smith  deputy director of yei  said in an article on the yei website   they have a unique product backed by yale science that shows tremendous promise for treating acid reflux  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>eli nutrition is built around a team of yale students with different business backgrounds  hasan ansari  som       fanni li  som       yulia khvan  som       srikar prasad  som      and faisal hamid  yc      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the start up was an outgrowth of yale s technology commercialization program  which matches promising faculty research with enterprising yale som students  through the program  yale school of medicine professor dr  john geibel was paired with som student ansari  who is a serial entrepreneur with a decade of professional experience in product commercialization  product planning  and strategy consulting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>geibel s research has shown that zinc is highly effective in stopping acid secretion in the stomach  without any side effects and with some increased health benefits to boot  and so tummyzen was born </paragraph>

    <paragraph>when asked about the school s general environment  the university of cambridge s judge school of business won out  followed closely by the ucla anderson school of management  both schools  the ft noted  also appeared in the top five for social life  and anderson scored high for networking </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of what students didn t like about their business school experience  chief complaints came around career services  followed by costs  branding was brought up by students who felt their school was not well enough known  location was raised by students at schools that were outside city centers  students of one year mba programs complained that they were too short  weather actually topped the list for many students who attended schools in north america or europe as the thing they most would have liked to change </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the foodies among you will want to take note  switzerland s imb topped the rankings for food satisfaction  with a perfect    out of     insead  located outside of paris  was ranked fifth for standard of food  if what you eat really matters to you  you might want to avoid manchester business school  which came in last  with a score of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to accommodation  emory university s goizueta business school seems to have the best digs  it scored a perfect    for both the standard and location of its accomodations  two indian schools  the indian school of business and iim ahmedabad  also got strong marks from their alumni  ranking third and fifth respectively  london business school did not fare so well  its alumni gave it a mean score of     on the cost of accommodation  and they also ranked it lowest on quality </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school dean apologies for school s past behavior toward women  pledges improvements</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  dean nitin nohria earlier this week acknowledged to an audience of     alumni and guests that the business school has at points in the past treated its female students and professors offensively </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there have been times at hbs when women felt  disrespected  left out and unloved by the school  i m sorry on behalf of the business school   he said  according to a report in poets quants   the school owed you better  and i promise it will be better  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his address  nohria pledged to increase the percentage of women who are protagonists in hbs case studies over the next five years to    percent  more than double the current level of   percent  according to the p q report  nohria shared that he would be meeting with hbs faculty this week to discuss how to meet this objective </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nohria tackled the topic of the school s treatment of women as part of a reception by the hbs association of northern california to honor more than     harvard alumnae for their impact on business and the community  according to the p q report  many of the women in the audience sighed audibly at the    percent goal  thinking it not ambitious enough  his remarks come five months after a new york times article describing hbs s efforts to address gender inequality </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the impact of nohria s goal to increase female representation in case studies would reach well beyond hbs  because the school s cases account for    percent of cases studied at business schools around the world  hbs made a similar effort to make its case studies more global  and today     percent are international in nature  up from less than   percent    years ago </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to the effort to increase the number of female protagonists in case studies  nohria also promised to launch a program devoted to helping more women serve on boards of directors and to encourage mentorship of female students and alumni  nohria did point out that hbs enrolled a record    percent women as part of this year s entering mba class </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  piloted a new interview process in round    compressing the timeline to four weeks and notifying applicants who were not admitted sooner than in past years </paragraph>

    <paragraph>the pilot was considered a success  so stanford is continuing with a similar timeline for round    all interview invitations will be issued between february  rd and march  th  none before and none after   we expect to issue the majority of invitations by february   th   read the admissions blog entry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the admissions team hopes that providing some certainty around the timing of interview invitations will help make the waiting a little easier </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck from those of us here at clear admit to those of you who submitted applications as part of stanford s round    remember that you can share your interview experiences and learn from those of others as part of clear admit s interview reports archive </paragraph>

  <title>    million alumni gift establish new family business initiative at cornell s johnson graduate school of management</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an alumnus who credits his own mba with the fact that his family business remained in the family and prospered has given     million to cornell university s samuel curtis johnson graduate school of management to establish a new family business initiative at the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gift  from john smith  mba      and his spouse dyan  will create the john and dyan smith family business initiative  which will be housed in johnson s entrepreneurship and innovation institute </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the smith s gift will endow the john and dyan smith professorship of management and family business  the recipient of which will serve as the initiative s lead faculty member  it also will endow the smith family clinical professorship of management  whose recipient will serve as director of the initiative </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  it establishes the smith family research  program and faculty support fund  which will support a range of activities including academic courses  student and alumni programming  marketing and outreach  presentations by visiting executive speakers and faculty recruitment </paragraph>
    <paragraph> with the smith s generous gift  we can now put in place a systematic program to help prepare students for starting  scaling and managing a family business   johnson dean soumitra dutta said in a statement   the smith family business initiative will have a profound and lasting impact on family business and graduate business education at johnson and cornell  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>smith believes that the education he received at cornell s then graduate school of business and public administration  bpa  helped him prepare for the federal deregulation of his family s freight trucking business and enabled that business crst international of cedar rapids  iowa to emerge as one of the    largest u s  truckload concerns while remaining within the family </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you have no concept of what the competitive pressures are going to bring on your business in deregulation   he said in a statement   i met the right professors at cornell  who convinced me that this was going to happen  and we d better be prepared  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one of the main reasons we are moving forward with crst remaining within our family is because of education   dyan smith added   the initiative is the next step to putting johnson in the forefront of family business management  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the smiths  son ian  mba      likely will not benefit from the full range of offerings the smith family business initiative will include  although johnson is moving quickly to develop a new and innovative curriculum specific to family businesses  wesley sine  faculty director of johnson s entrepreneurship and innovation institute  is already at work on a course focusing on the benefits and challenges specific to family businesses  he is also developing the smith family distinguished family business lecture series  which will bring executives from the world s most successful family businesses to speak to students on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph> family businesses are the most common type of business on the earth  particularly in developing countries   sine said in a statement   the greater the extent to which we help family businesses across the globe be more successful  the greater our relevance and the larger our impact  </paragraph>

  <title>fuqua school of business mba demystifies week in cities</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>advice to prospective mba students  be prepared for lots of acronyms  this from fuqua school of business first year mba student trevor mckinnon in a recent post to the school s daytime mba student blog   apparently  mba students are so busy that we don t have time to speak in complete sentences and rely on acronyms and abbreviations to save us precious seconds in conversation   he writes  one such acronym at fuqua is wic  which stands for week in cities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wic are mini trips organized by various student clubs to cities across the country during school breaks  each week in cities trip is focused on a particular industry and includes scheduled visits for participating students at several companies and firms that might have internships or full time job opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mckinnon took part in a consulting focused wic trip to dallas during fuqua s fall break  his was organized by two first year students  who helped set up lodging  transportation and company visits  twenty one students took part  which meant that this wic group was on the smaller side  mckinnon notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the dallas consulting wic trip  fuqua students visited pricewaterhousecoopers  mckinsey  bain  bcg and accenture  with presentations  tours and networking opportunities at each firm  but the wic itinerary left time for sightseeing as well   strolling around dallas  arts district  trying out a local bbq place  visiting the george w  presidential library and museum </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mckinnon writes that it was well worth figuring out what wic stands for and actually going on a trip   for one  it gave me the chance to visit the offices of various firms that i m recruiting for and get a better sense for what makes each one unique  actually being in their buildings and talking with their employees helped me better understand their values and culture  and identify the firms that best align with my personal and career objectives   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>networking opportunities with employees at the various consulting firms was also a big bonus  he adds   we were able to network with and talk to far more people than we can during on campus presentations  since our group was small  we were able to get a lot more face time with the people that we will  hopefully  be working closely with this summer and beyond  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wic trips also provide fuqua students with a great chance to get to know their fellow first year students better  mckinnon notes   although we re all hoping to land internships with these companies  being together and becoming better friends has helped us band together and help each other during the recruiting process  since the trip  we ve already discussed our thoughts on the companies  shared ideas to prepare for interviews and we re doing all we can to collectively succeed  </paragraph>

  <title>tax deductions and the mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the u s  tax court recently ruled that an mba student who deducted         in tuition expenses from his      tax return owes more than        in back taxes to the internal revenue service  bloomberg businessweek reports  ouch  as follow up  bloomberg bw offers a few things to keep in mind regarding tuition deductions </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the rules for deducting educational expenses sound simple enough  tuition is deductible when it pays for coursework that enhances skills necessary for an established job or business  as well as any courses required by an employer   reads the bloomberg bw article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  even the simplest rules can quickly grow complex  for instance  what if the skills you gain through an mba not only enhance your ability to perform your current job but also qualify you to pursue a new career </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there isn t a bright line distinction that says  if you ve worked so many years  making a certain salary  you can claim the deduction   david young  a partner at young and co  in rochester  ny  told bloomberg bw  in terms of tuition deductions  if an auditor challenges the deduction  it falls on the taxpayer to prove that the mba is a business expense  young adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>doing so can be tricky  but the tax court has ruled in favor of mba candidates who have claimed tuition deductions in the past  according to the bloomberg bw report  although this most recent case  in which the court ruled that rollins college mba adam hart owes money in back taxes  may embolden auditors to pursue cases   every time the irs gets a case like this  they become more self assured   bob charron  a partner at friedman in new york  told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>large deductions  too  are more likely to attract auditors  attention  jackie perlman  principal tax analyst at the tax institute  the research and analysis division of tax prep company h r block told bloomberg bw  when in doubt  it s probably best to consult an expert  especially since taxpayers who appear to have intentionally flouted rules often face stiffer penalties  and it s hard to claim financial illiteracy as a business school student </paragraph>

  <title>latin americans flock to spain to pursue an mba</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in growing numbers  latin americans are turning to top business schools in spain   notably esade  ie and iese   to obtain their mbas before returning to careers in latin america  the new york times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>spain s own economy is still faltering  but business schools there say they are attracting more and more latin americans  many with international career experience  who plan to return to latin america when they graduate  according to the times report  they are drawn to spanish mba programs  according to the report  because the classrooms are more diverse than at schools in the united states and the business culture is a more familiar one  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i really feel like i made the right decision to come to europe because the whole educational system   the interaction with the professors  the interaction with the students   is so much more similar to the way that business is done in south america than what i was exposed to in the u s    brazilian native joana jo fratini told the times  she started classes at esade last year after obtaining an undergraduate economics degree from penn state university </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at esade     percent of this year s graduating class is latin american  in response to this growing contingent  esade has launched a study program called  doing business in latin america   and has decided to offer a full time mba program in spanish beginning next year  until now  the school s mba program was taught only in english </paragraph>
    <paragraph>iese  another top ranked school based in barcelona  is also making changes in response to growing numbers of latin american students  this year  with    percent of its students from latin america  iese launched an executive mba in s o paolo  brazil  which offers courses in english  portuguese and spanish for business professionals from brazil and neighboring countries </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that latin americans are showing interest in spanish schools is not surprising or even necessarily new   there are existing economic ties  a shared business culture and  for many latin americans  a shared language </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is new is the degree to which latin american students are heading to spanish mba programs with every intention of returning to latin america after graduation   there are a lot more opportunities in latin america   javier mu oz  iese director of mba career services  told the times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>xavier gimbert  who oversees latin american programs and initiatives at esade  agrees  noting that demand for qualified mbas has soared as countries in the region open up to big latin american based multinationals   if you compare colombia with five or    years ago  it is another country   he told the times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a plan to return to latin america with an mba in hand is prevalent among students at spain s ie business school as well  the majority of latin american students at ie   where they make up about    percent of the total student population   say they want to return to latin america to work  according to the times report  ie student polls reveal that as many as    percent of brazilian students and    percent of peruvian students plan to return to their home countries </paragraph>

  <title>teamwork  listening skills essential for mbas   and prospective applicants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>team assignments have become de rigeur as part of the mba curriculum at many leading business schools  with some schools assigning students to teams when they first arrive and requiring them to work together in multiple classes and others having students shift between several different teams as part of a single course or semester </paragraph>
    <paragraph>why such a focus on teamwork  experts believe that learning to work in small groups will pay off when the students graduate and look for jobs  according to a recent article in u s  news   world report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba students are likely to find themselves in a work environment where reaching common goals will require a group effort   whether it s launching a product in a new market or designing a strategy for a hospital to reduce the cost of its services while also improving quality  paula caproni  who teaches about creating high performing teams to mbas at the ross school of business at university of michigan  told u s  news </paragraph>
    <paragraph> many problems are far too complex for any one person to resolve  they need to learn how to depend on others   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba students who work in teams as part of business school will be much better prepared for the work world that awaits them upon graduation than peers who completed most of their projects solo  experts say  there are several important steps involved in working in a group  which students who have worked as teams will learn  at the university of miami  mba students doing consulting projects are asked to put together a charter laying out ground rules and roles right from the start  dean gene anderson of the school of business administration told u s  news </paragraph>
    <paragraph>assigning roles   who will do what  when and how   is one of the first things taught by professors who specialize in teamwork strategies  at the university of miami  mba students are sometimes put in groups to act as consultants and work as a team  says gene anderson  dean of the school of business administration  one of the first things they re asked to do is put together a charter  which lays out ground rules and roles </paragraph>
    <paragraph> who s going to act as the team leader  who s going to be the scribe  who s going to be the communications liaison to people outside the team   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>next  a team needs to focus on establishing a process   how often the team will meet  for how long  what records will be kept </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here enters another key skill mba students must develop as part of working in a team  the ability to listen  gregory patton  who teaches communication skills at the university of southern california s marshall school of business  reminds students that what they say sometimes is less important than what they hear </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we say listening to understand versus listening to argue   patton told u s  news  reminding students that understanding another group member s ideas can actually advance their own thinking </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective applicants to business school have great opportunities to practice their listening skills before even starting their mba program   any time they meet someone new  patton says   ask them three follow up questions to learn about them  don t interrupt  don t focus on yourself   he told u s  news  this approach will create a deeper relationship and also allow you to learn more  he adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another way prospective applicants can prepare for student team projects as part of the mba is to seek out group or team based assignments at work or while volunteering  looking for ways to learn from the experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph> while you re on those teams  be very mindful of your own behavior in that team  of what you want to learn  of how you personally are helping and hurting the team   michigan s caproni told u s  news   learn as much as you can about team dynamics  </paragraph>

  <title>few business schools  admissions decisions hinge on gmat integrated reasoning score  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a majority of business school admissions officers report that an applicant s score on the gmat s new integrated reasoning  ir  section is not currently an important part of their evaluation of a prospective student s overall gmat score  according to a recent survey by kaplan test prep </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in its      survey of business school admissions officers  kaplan found that    percent of mba programs say that they do not place significant weight on the scores applicants submit for the gmat s new ir section  which was launched in august       however  the survey did find that more than half     percent  of mba programs list a low overall gmat score as  the biggest application killer  for prospective applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmat test takers receive a separate score for the ir section  which means that even very strong performance on other sections of the exam can t mask poor performance on this section </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s not surprising that a majority of business schools are not currently placing too much importance on the integrated reasoning section  since it makes sense they d want to gather performance data on a new section before fully incorporating it into their evaluation process   lee weiss  executive director of pre business programs for kaplan test prep  said in a statement  weiss went on to point out that since gmat scores are valid for five years  not all applicants in      or      will have submitted the integrated reasoning section </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools may decide that ir should play a greater role in admissions decisions moving forward  weiss added  he cautioned that even though many business schools indicate that they are not placing significant emphasis on the new section yet  prospective applicants should still prepare for the new section as seriously as they do for the quantitative and verbal sections   it still matters   he stressed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kaplan s      survey included responses from     admissions officers from business schools across the united states  including five of the top    mba programs  as compiled by u s  news   world report </paragraph>

  <title>little change year over year in poets quants  mba rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>poets quants today released its      composite ranking of the best full time mba programs in the united states  revealing that very little has changed since last year  in fact  the top eight programs this year are exactly the same  in the same order  as they were last year  the only change among the top    schools was that ninth and tenth place last year  berkeley s haas school of business and duke university s fuqua school  flip flopped this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>p q arrives at its rankings by weighing five other leading mba rankings  bloomberg businessweek  the economist  the financial times  forbes  and u s  news   world report  the composite ranking  p q asserts  helps reduce flaws in the other rankings caused by faulty survey technique  biased methodology or other issues   the composite index tones down the noise in each of these five surveys to get more directly at the real signal that is being sent   reads the p q report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of what the  real signal  is  here are some of p q s conclusions  this year and last  harvard business school  stanford graduate school of business  the university of chicago booth school of business and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania held steady in spots one through four  but the underlying index scores in the composite ranking were especially close this year  with just fractions of a point separating the programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite the very close scores  p q pointed out that chicago booth outranked wharton for the fourth consecutive year   giving slightly more credence to the view that it is no longer harvard stanford wharton at the top   wharton was the only school among the top    to see application volume decline  it dropped     percent  for the class of       chicago booth  in contrast  reported the greatest application volume increase      percent  rendering it slightly more selective than wharton for the first time ever </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  the top    programs are having a great year  with all but one reporting an increase in mba applications  allowing most to be even more selective than usual  graduate management admission test  gmat  averages for the class of      likewise rose at nine of the ten schools  breaking records at stanford      average this year  up from      and wharton      average this year  up from      among others </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the quality of the pool is just stronger   stacey r  kole  deputy dean of the full time mba program at chicago booth  told p q   we hit a     median gmat this year  the   th percentile  there are very few people under     these days  when i got here    years ago  the average gmat was      it s a record this year at      and it s not like we just shimmied under the bar on gmat  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>undergraduate grade point averages remained pretty stable at most of the top schools  though at stanford it rose even higher  to       the highest of any u s  business school and up from      last year  chicago booth and dartmouth college s tuck school of business also reported small increases in average gpa </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you can find a little more movement year over year the farther down the rankings you look  with a few schools moving up or slipping down a spot or two  the university of michigan s ross school and the university of virginia s darden school  like haas and fuqua  swapped spots this year  to no     and no     respectively  ucla s anderson school of management climbed from no     to no      bumping nyu s stern school from no     last year down to no      yale school of management  for its part  slipped to no      down from    last year </paragraph>

    <paragraph>it is important to keep in mind what the essay is and what it isn t  the essay isn t a newspaper op ed  it isn t a definitive statement on a critical issue of the hour  it isn t even an essay that you write for your professor  consider  you only have    minutes to think about  plan out  write and proof your essay  so there s a limit to what you can say and how effectively you can say it  the purpose of the essay is to enable the schools to verify that you really wrote the essays that you submitted with your application  if you sent in a beautifully crafted  eloquent essay but only managed an illiterate  ungrammatical and perfunctory essay in the gmat the school will wonder whether someone other than you wrote your application essays  the gmat essay does not have to astound anyone with its brilliance  it just has to be good enough to make sure that the school admissions officers don t start to entertain doubts as to your authenticity as a writer  keep this in mind though  while a poorly written essay could harm your cause  a well written  perhaps even outstanding one won t advance it very much  the score the business schools continue to be guided by is the main quantitative and verbal score  an adequate score for the essay will suffice  an inadequate score will hurt </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an essay  not a grocery list</paragraph>
    <paragraph>this is an essay  not an office memorandum  an e mail or a grocery list  it has to read like a narrative  like a logical progression of an argument  there can be no bullet points  numbered paragraphs  headings  underlined words  abbreviations such as w out or b c  colloquialisms  acronyms  internet slang such as lol  imho  p p  b b  fwiw and otoh  all sentences must include at least one noun and one verb  memorize words that allow you to transition from one paragraph to another such as  however    on the one hand  and  on the other hand    moreover    furthermore    in addition    consequently   and  it is possible  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>avoid inserting yourself into the essay as much as possible  there is no need for such expressions as  i think  on  in my opinion   or  i don t agree   such terms are redundant  you are the one writing the essay  the reader knows this  he or she doesn t need to be told </paragraph>
    <paragraph>critical reasoning without the multiple choice</paragraph>
    <paragraph>approach the essay as you would the critical reasoning questions  particularly the so called weaken questions  there s a stimulus a passage that arrives at a conclusion  usually a business plan  a policy prescription  a recommended course of action  there are also factual and axiomatic premises and a number of implicit assumptions  of which one is key  in the critical reasoning exercises  the weaken questions ask you to select the statement that does the most to undermine the key assumption  as we have pointed out before  answering the question requires you to follow a careful strategy  first  you identify the conclusion  then you identify the evidence on which it is based  then you tease out the key assumption that enabled the author to go from the reach the conclusion from the evidence </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the same strategy applies to the essay  you must be taking a critical  aggressive approach to the stimulus  as in the weaken questions  first identify the conclusion  you don t necessarily have to disagree with it  but you do have to take issue with how it was reached   the essay must show why the conclusion isn t warranted by the evidence  was the sample partial or inadequate  was the author s use of the evidence inappropriate  does the logic of the argument permit us to infer the conclusion  what logical fallacies has the author perpetrated  after you have taken the author s argument apart  you should suggest what kind of evidence might have helped to strengthen his argument </paragraph>
    <paragraph>classic fallacies</paragraph>
    <paragraph>become familiar with classic fallacies  we spend much of our time putting forward arguments and criticizing the ones put forward by others  therefore  it s important to know the most frequently deployed fallacious arguments  the passage stimulus could be based on one or more of them  there is no shortage of fallacies  here is a very partial list  using unrepresentative or insufficient samples  false analogies  confusing causation with correlation  confusing cause with effect  ascribing a single cause to an event that had many causes  cherry picking the evidence  post hoc ergo propter hoc  because one event preceded another  the earlier event must have caused the later event   false dichotomies  appeal to ignorance  a claim is true if it has not been proven to be false   appeal to authority or to a majority  affirming the consequent  denying the antecedent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>keep an eye on the clock</paragraph>
    <paragraph>keep your eye on the clock  as soon as    minutes are up  the screen will disappear  you don t want to be in the middle of a sentence when that happens  organize your time with a view to getting everything done within    minutes  that means you must stop writing once    minutes are up because you must leave yourself at least five minutes at the end for proofing  the test center provides you with a rudimentary word processing program that allows you to type  delete  cut  paste and nothing else  there is no spell check  no grammar check  no matter how good a writer you think you are or how good a typist you think you are  you will make mistakes  particularly as you are writing under a time constraint  therefore  it is imperative that you leave yourself time to clean up your essay to get rid of typos  misspellings  repetitions  dangling participles  incorrect punctuation and missing words  it is stupid to lose points over silly errors  you should also use this time to make the essay tighter and more cogent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t get carried away by the rhetorical power of your own arguments  it is good of course to offer as many criticisms of the author s argument as possible  however  the more you pile on  the less time you are leaving for proofing  if you have come up with two reasons for calling into question the essay stimulus s claim  don t reach for a third if it means that you won t be able to finish the essay  two reasons and a completed essay is better than three reasons and an incomplete essay </paragraph>
    <paragraph>keep the structure simple</paragraph>
    <paragraph>the structure of the essay should be as straightforward as possible  it should start with a paragraph outlining your basic objection to the way the author has reached his or her conclusion  there is no need to go into details in the opening paragraph  it should serve as a brief summary of what you intend to argue  it s bad form in general to step on the points you will make later  you want to keep the reader reading  so hold stuff back  moreover  as likely as not  your main point may not be entirely clear to you when you start writing  the more you write the clearer will your argument become to you  therefore  leave your opening paragraph as a draft and come back to it at the end to ensure that it conveys the main point you want to make </paragraph>
    <paragraph>start by jotting down all of the ways the author s argument fails to convince  then select the two or three strongest reasons for doubting the logic of his argument  your second paragraph should focus on the most important reason why the author s argument is inadequate  your third paragraph should focus on the second reason  your fourth paragraph on the third  make sure you mention what evidence you would like to see adduced in order to make the argument more compelling  that could be your fifth paragraph  the last paragraph should be reserved for the conclusion  this is usually a restatement of the opening paragraph  that s why it s good at the end to go back to the beginning and redraft the opening sentences </paragraph>
    <paragraph>don t forget  it s only    minutes  a good essay will put you into the right frame of mind for the rest of the test </paragraph>

  <title>business schools accept greater percentages of applicants from non traditional backgrounds  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>business school are increasingly accepting more applicants with backgrounds in fields other than consulting  marketing and business  according to results from a recent survey by kaplan test prep  kaplan surveyed business school admissions directors from     business schools and found that    percent said they accepted more students from stem  science  technology  engineering and math  backgrounds for the         cycle than they did three years ago </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business school demographics are shifting  with growth coming from applicants who are younger  more international and have stem backgrounds   lee weiss  kaplan executive director of pre business and pre graduate programs  said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>weiss also contributed the shifting demographics to growth in specialized master s degree programs   a specialized master s degree can be a great fit if an applicant knows they want to pursue a career in that particular field  while a traditional mba provides broader options   weiss added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the kaplan survey also found that    percent of business schools polled reported accepting more students who applied directly from college than three years ago  it also showed that only    percent of business school admissions officers cited lack of relevant work experience as the biggest  application killer   compared with    percent who said low test scores  on the gmat or gre entrance exam  could cause an applicant to be rejected </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  even many of the most selective business schools claim that no single component of the application will determine a candidate s fate   rather that they view the entire process holistically  and kaplan  which helps prospective applicants prepare for both the gmat and gre entrance tests  has reason to spotlight results suggesting that test scores hold greater sway than other elements  still  the growing diversity of applicant industry background is interesting to note </paragraph>

  <title>leading business schools increase focus on social entrepreneurship</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>social entrepreneurship is becoming a more prevalent facet within the graduate management curriculum at several leading business schools  driven in great part by growing student demand  according to a recent new york times article   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are putting down the tracks as the train is coming   pamela hartigan  director of the skoll center for social entrepreneurship at oxford university s said business school  told the times regarding that school s social entrepreneurship offerings  hartigan estimates that about half of the students at said are interested in issues of long term social and ethical sustainability  although experts say that students interested in social business still make up only a minority of mba applicants  according to the times report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a study by the sustainable business networking group net impact last year found that    percent of respondents would consider working in social enterprise and that    percent were considering jobs in the nonprofit sector  though the times noted that the figures may have been influenced by lower than usual hiring in more traditional post mba sectors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an economist article earlier this month expressed greater skepticism regarding reports of a trend toward social entrepreneurship within leading mba programs  suggesting that it s largely pr hype   business schools claim their graduates are less concerned than they once were about earning fabulous salaries   read the economist report   instead of trumpeting the number of students who get high paying jobs in finance  they now reel off examples of those who join non profits or launch social enterprise  this fits the socially aware image they wish to portray after the financial crisis  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nevertheless  that business schools are focused on projecting a more socially aware image is in itself a shift  at the same time  business schools are increasingly recognizing and responding to the fact that social and business management needs are not actually at odds   running a good charity  that runs on sound financial principles  comes from learning some of the tools that business can provide   said s hartigan told the times  likewise  traditional business managers today need training in issues like corporate social responsibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph> so  as business bends to demands for better behavior and nonprofits bend to the need to be more businesslike  business schools are making a two way bet   concludes the times </paragraph>

    <paragraph>indeed     percent of companies reported as part of the gmac      corporate recruiters survey that they plan to hire recent mbas this year  up from    percent that hired in        not only that  those employers expect to hire an average of      new mba hires  up from      a year before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these rebounding figures have helped some schools achieve record setting placement levels  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school reports that      percent of its most recent class of graduates received job offers within three months of graduation  with median base salaries rising to          from          the year before  the mccombs school of business at the university of texas at austin also saw hiring pick up  with salaries up to boot   we saw a six year high for mba students employed three months after graduation  with    percent of our students with job offers   stacey rudnick  mccombs director of mba career management  told forbes  the average starting salary for mccombs graduates this year was           and    percent of grads received a signing bonus as well  worth an average         </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba hiring remains very strong in management consulting  corporate finance and marketing product management  but wall street and investment banking offer fewer jobs and are attracting fewer students  according to fred staudmyer  director of career management at the johnson school of cornell university   consulting is still a huge draw for mbas and there s still lots of work   he told forbes  meanwhile  mba students are also showing increasing interest in the technology sector and new digital media   and finding increasing numbers of jobs there   big tech is hiring more mbas each year in the internet retail  social media and business solutions spaces  and more of our mbas are interested in earlier stage companies now   staudmyer added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to gary fraser  who leads career services at the university of southern california s marshall school of business  his students are looking most toward the hi tech  healthcare and consultancy sectors   we believe this increased interest is based on a few factors such as growth from new innovation  corporate stability and the california location that many of these firms offer   fraser told forbes  he adds that marshall this year saw an increase in the number of companies visiting campus  hosting case competitions and participating in student club events </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school prepares to offer online courses</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  is at work on a new online learning initiative called hbx  though it is sharing few details about the effort so far  bloomberg businessweek and the chronicle of higher education report  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other top business schools like the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and stanford university s graduate school of business have been unveiling moocs  massive online open courses  over the past year  as has harvard university itself  so it s not surprising that hbs is developing online courses  too  although it hasn t decided yet whether those courses will be broadcast as moocs  according to the chronicle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brian c  kenny  hbs chief marketing and communications officer  told the chronicle that the school has not yet decided if it would use edx  the nonprofit organization harvard university founded last year with the massachusetts institute of technology  to deliver the online courses  but kenny told bloomberg bw that the courses would likely be offered through edx  starting in spring or summer      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to kenny  hbs is still working out how to deliver online its signature pedagogical technique  the case method  which is built on intensive interaction among students and faculty   whether or not the case method can work online is a question that we haven t answered yet   he told the chronicle </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kenny declined to give any other specifics about hbx  including what courses are planned  any costs to students or how the school plans to make money  bloomberg bw turned to linkedin to try to learn more  surmising that the effort has been underway since at least june  when jana kierstead  executive director of the harvard mba program  was named to head the new initiative  according to her linkedin profile  in her profile  she describes hbx as  a new team dedicated to delivering high quality business education through innovative online products  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the chronicle  for its part  scoured job postings in an attempt to uncover more information  it found a july job posting for hbx that suggested that hbs does plan to make money from its online activities  the posting  which has since been removed  was for a sales and marketing expert who can  develop a deep understanding of the online learning market and collaborate with constituents across harvard business school to successfully market and sell hbx s product line   the chronicle reports </paragraph>

  <title>change is the only constant where mba programs are concerned</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in the united states today  nearly four times as many students earn an mba as earn a law degree  a ratio that was one to one a mere    years ago  even as american demand begins to level off  students in emerging markets  especially india and china  are flocking to the degree in growing numbers  but against this backdrop of swelling popularity  prospective mba applicants are taking a hard look at the potential return on investment as never before  as follow up to its rankings  released last week  the economist examined these and other important shifts in the mba landscape as part of an article published over the weekend </paragraph>
    <paragraph>data from the economist s most recent rankings show that the average basic salary for mba graduates has dropped        in the past five years  to          meanwhile  student surveys the economist conducted as part of its rankings reveal that students are more focused now on how much they stand to make post mba than they were before the economic crisis  moreover  as salaries have fallen  tuition has climbed  at the university of chicago booth school of business  ranked no    in the economist      rankings  tuition has gone up by         since       to           at harvard business school  hbs   it has increased by         in the same time period </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective mba applicants must now do a careful analysis before starting a program to make sure it is worth their time and money  but that s only one of the ways the mba has changed  the economist points out  another shift has been toward more specialized degrees and concentrations within the mba  with more and more programs now offering tracks tailored to specific industries  such as health care or luxury goods  or specific study areas  such as data analytics  this shift is driven by the steep competition students face to line up their post graduation career before day one of the mba  students are sometimes so focused on finding the right job that they can forget to savor the learning experience  chicago booth dean sunil kumar told the economist </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the biggest change the mba faces  according to the economist article  is the rise of educational technology  to mooc or not to mooc   that is  to offer some courses free of charge to students around the globe via online platforms   is a question business schools are grappling with  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school recently announced that it will offer its core mba courses via mooc  and hbs is also developing online courses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but beyond giving classes away for free  how and when business schools embrace distance learning as part of their for pay offerings will likely prove the hottest arena to watch  the economist suggests  the university of north carolina s kenan flagler business school blazed the trail  with the debut last fall of its mba unc program  an online mba program that can be completed in    months  unc currently enrolls approximately twice as many students in its online program as in its full time  on campus program   and it charges the online students more  the economist reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to douglas shackelford  who directs the mba unc program  online classroom technology has now reached a tipping point  where it is at least as good as a real classroom and in some respects even better  mba unc classes are capped at    students  all of whom can interact with each other from locations around the globe  professors  likewise  can lecture from india  france and across the united states  and those lectures are available      for students to watch as often as they like  at their own pace </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools  though  should take heed  the economist article suggests  because as mba students are given more choice as to how to obtain their degree  business schools may be forced to compete on price  many for the first time </paragraph>

    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  reclaimed the top spot in the forbes      biennial ranking of mba programs  released today  the university of chicago booth school of business took second  bumping harvard business school  hbs   which topped the list in       to third place  the university of pennsylvania s wharton school followed up the lead in fourth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>forbes  which ranks full time mba programs every two years based on return on investment  found that at the top    programs in the united states  the degree still pays off  although it takes longer to do so  for the class of       the class surveyed for this year s ranking  the average payback period was     years  as compared to     years a decade ago  forbes reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gsb graduates tied for the highest average paycheck entering the mba program           the same as hbs and wharton   but their median compensation five years out from graduation            was greater than any of the other schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs dropped to third place this year because its five years out total compensation fell by    percent  from          two years ago to          according to this year s survey  as a result  the five year gain for hbs graduates this year was          down from          in      </paragraph>

  <title>upenn s wharton school sees uptick in round one applicant volume</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the university of pennsylvania s wharton school saw an increase this year in the number of applications submitted by its round one deadline last week  according to the deputy vice dean for admissions  financial aid and career management   if you believe that application volume is an indicator of the relevance of an mba program  then i am pleased to announce that our round one numbers are up   wrote deputy vice dean maryellen lamb in a post to the wharton mba admissions blog yesterday  she did not disclose how much round one application volume increased </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lamb s comment referred to a wall street journal article last week that questioned whether four years of declining application volume to the philadelphia school might be an indicator that it had fallen from its long held position as one of the most elite mba programs in the world  wharton s director of admissions ankur kumar also announced last week that she was leaving her position to pursue other opportunities effective october  th  lamb  who was promoted earlier this year from her position as director of mba career management to the role of deputy vice dean overseeing admissions  financial aid and career management  will lead the admissions department following kumar s departure </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond announcing the uptick in round one application volume  lamb devoted her post yesterday to providing an explanation of wharton s team based discussion  tbd   a new interview method the school launched last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our goal was to give our potential students an opportunity to show us who they are   how they think  lead  communicate and interact   she wrote   at the same time  we wanted our applicants to experience who we are   a highly collaborative culture that cultivates persuasive rather than positional leadership  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>acknowledging that many of last year s prospective applicants approached the new interview format with trepidation  lamb noted that the pilot went well and that many participants reported that they enjoyed it  she went on to outline the logistics of the newest component of wharton s application process for this year s applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lamb explained in her post that the team based discussion will be by invitation only  like wharton s one on one interview  and will be required to complete the admissions process  five to six applicants will take part in each tbd  with the composition of the groups determined by the timing of when individual applicants sign up   there will be no  crafting  done on our end   lamb noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants who are invited to take part in the tbd will receive a prompt for the discussion prior to the interview  lamb and her team recommend that applicants  with this prompt  devote about an hour of advance preparation for the exercise </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the admissions process will still include a short one on one  individual conversation with an admissions team member   lamb wrote  these short individual interviews will follow an applicant s tbd exercise </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in last year s pilot  wharton will conduct the majority of the tbd interviews on campus  with second year admissions fellows leading the exercises  although some tbds in each application round will also be conducted by admissions officers in select cities around the world   on  and off campus team based discussions will be conducted in the same way and considered equally   lamb noted   there is no  advantage  in choosing either option   she added </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit career services director q a  stephen rakas of the tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stephen rakas has been in career services with the tepper school of business at carnegie mellon for the past    years and in his current role as executive director of the career opportunities center  coc  since       his previous experience includes four years in career services with the university of pittsburgh and an additional decade of experience in general management and sales in industries ranging from healthcare to high end retail </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i discovered earlier in my career that serving as a conduit between the academic and business environments was a strong match with my skills and interests   he told us   i m passionate about higher education  and the opportunity to help students transition their academic achievements into the world of work is very rewarding  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>check out the interview below  in which he describes the comprehensive base camp orientation all tepper students undergo before classes even begin  explains why all the members of the coc team devote time both to counseling students and to maintaining relationships with employers and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  how do you view your role as director of the career opportunities center  is it to administer workshops  counsel students  counsel companies  manage the entire office and oversee its various functions  all of the above </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stephen rakas  similar to how faculty are focused on delivering our business curriculum to students  my team and i are focused on teaching our students the skills needed to be successful networkers  job candidates and interviewees  our mission is to help our students develop a career focus in line with their personal mix of skills  values and interests  to guide them in developing the tools and resources they need to market themselves and to create a professional environment where students and recruiters can meet and interact to explore opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if we re doing it right  we re teaching our students a set of skills they will use throughout their working life to manage their careers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  to do that effectively  i need to ensure i m managing our resources and team appropriately to enable us to set and achieve relevant goals  which include both student counseling coaching activities as well as employer relations management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as a smaller program  we have the opportunity at the tepper school to know our students as individuals and to partner closely with our recruiters to understand and support their goals as well  given that i came up through the ranks in career services  i enjoy keeping engaged with students  so i still keep a small counseling load  and i try to meet with as many others as my schedule permits </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  an important part of my job is to ensure we re partnering effectively with our colleagues across admissions  student services  corporate relations  alumni relations and other areas to maximize all of our efforts and resources </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  now  about your team  how many career advisors do you have  is this a relatively constant figure  if not  how has it changed in recent years  how might it change in the near future </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  we have a staff of     which includes eight counselors at the associate director or director levels  three staff who manage our recruiting efforts and two others in general office administration  as with most mba programs  we ve made a conscious effort to attract and recruit career counselors with relevant experience in the industries and functions most often pursued by our students  several of them are graduates of our mba program  and all of them perform both student counseling and employer relations duties  while many schools have separate teams focusing on these activities  we ve found the dual role keeps our team energized and their industry knowledge remains current through their frequent interactions with employers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our counselors work in teams based on their industry functional expertise  which are aligned with the careers most often pursued by our students  for example  students preparing for consulting opportunities have a different path than those preparing for financial services  so these teams work closely with our students and student clubs to offer relevant programming  our students are assigned to a particular counselor based on their declared interests  and after the initial required meetings are completed  the student can choose to continue to meet with their counselor exclusively  or to meet with any other counselor of their choice  this process has been very popular with our students  and the student ratings on our one to one advising sessions have been very strong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we were honored this past year to be ranked the    career services office in the bloomberg businessweek mba rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  can you provide prospective applicants with an overview of the recruitment process at tepper  when does it start  how does it unfold </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i tell our incoming students that the recruiting process for summer internships begins well before they arrive on campus for our base camp orientation program  which is a school wide effort taking up most of the month of august  we provide an online checklist of activities for them to complete over the summer  mainly related to self assessment and introducing resources to help them to learn more about careers of interest to them and how to interact with recruiters  they complete the paperwork related to assigning them to a relevant counselor  and they are asked to arrive at base camp with a working draft of their updated resume ready to share with their counselor  at base camp  our sessions provide an overview of the career services office and the on campus recruiting process  as well as entire days devoted to career  verticals   which consist of faculty and career center staff presentations  as well as alumni panels focused on consulting  finance  marketing  operations and entrepreneurship  which encompasses the career interests of almost all of our students  we re not necessarily requiring them to select a path from which there is no alternative  but we are letting them know that if they don t at least identify plans a and b  they are going to be at a disadvantage when talking with recruiters in a few short weeks </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after base camp is over  classes begin at the end of august  the tepper school is well known for its analytical rigor and rapid pace  we operate on a mini semester system  so students are changing classes every six and one half weeks  with breaks between known as  experience weeks   these periods are used for clubs treks  supported by the coc   as well as sessions with our new accelerate leadership center  which provides programming and coaching to develop our students  leadership and communication skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph>employers host presentations and other events for all students beginning the first week of classes  but on campus recruiting in the fall is for second year students only  of course  many first year students will land internship offers in the fall  as a result of attending the various conferences and national career fairs offered during that period  during the fall  our first year students also have a series of required meetings with the coc  including resume and mock interview sessions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>our first year students officially begin interviewing on campus in january for summer internships </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how has the economy impacted recruitment at tepper  how have you and your staff remained flexible or adapted in order to help students navigate a more challenging job market  have you encouraged flexibility on the part of students themselves </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  all business programs felt the impact of the downturn of       fortunately  at tepper we began to see a strong recruiting recovery within about    months  and the last three years have shown a steadily increasing employment rate  as well as rising salaries  many consider the consulting industry to be a bellwether  meaning it s often the first to contract hiring and the first to recover in a turbulent economy  consulting has emerged as our    industry in the last few years  followed by other high growth sectors like technology  bio pharma and manufacturing  financial services recruiting has remained more challenging  but this situation is by no means unique to the tepper school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in      and       when many long term recruiters were cutting back and entire companies were collapsing  we reacted by reaching out and heavily engaging our alumni  as a smaller program  our alumni have always been a critical component of our success  and many alumni came through with summer internships and full time job opportunities for our students  they helped to reinforce our messages of networking and leveraging the tight knit tepper alumni community  many of our alumni were amazingly generous with their time and support  even when they were not in a position to provide job opportunities </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i believe the  great recession  and the sluggish recovery that has followed has imprinted heavily on the generation of students currently attending mba programs  for many of them  it s the only economic environment they have known as working adults  this seems to have raised awareness of the importance of not relying too heavily on outside forces or counting on sheer luck to achieve your goals  when alumni speak about the importance of building and maintaining a network  and share their own experiences  this group appears to be listening and taking the advice to heart more than i ve seen in the past </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how does your team counsel students regarding the interview  is there a formal mock interview process  how are interview schedules administered  is there an established policy regarding how closed and open interviews should be conducted  what facilities are available for interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  at our base camp orientation program  our overarching message is that our students need to be  recruiter ready   which includes having well developed interviewing skills  our counselors bring a wealth of interviewing expertise from their past careers  and we also offer a series of workshops  co hosted by our student government and professional clubs  to focus on things like stars  case interviews and other topics  our professional clubs  including consulting  finance and others  offer specific technical content and training aimed at improving performance in industry specific interviews </paragraph>
    <paragraph>also  each student must successfully  pass  a videotaped mock interview with their counselor in order to retain access to recruiting  after on campus recruiting begins  students who are singled out by recruiters as poorly prepared in any way are required to meet with a counselor and work on improving any deficiencies  or face disciplinary action </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for on campus recruiting  we do not require a set percentage of  open  or  closed  schedules  nor do we currently offer bidding  when we had the technology available to offer bidding  we had so few employers interested that we discontinued it  most companies prefer closed schedules  and our recruiting staff does a tremendous job working with companies to condense schedules or make last minute additions to ensure schedules are filled with candidates the employer wants to interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what kind of role do alumni play in tepper s recruiting process  how integral are they to your office s success  is alumni participation a major part of students  job searches </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  our alumni are a critical part of our success  i ve already described how the tepper alumni community came through during the downturn of a few years ago  in addition to that  we have many eager alumni advocates supporting recruiting  hosting treks  appearing on panels and many other things  i believe our smaller size works in our favor in this regard </paragraph>
    <paragraph>having been at tepper for    years  one of the most rewarding things for me  personally  is when former students are now our recruiters  alumni panelists or hosting groups of students on the same treks they helped to organize when they were students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  do you have any advice for prospective applicants in terms of what they might do in advance of the mba program to be better prepared for the job search process  in your experience  do you find that students who have done x  y or z before arriving on campus have a more successful experience with career services and the job search as a whole </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sr  whether incoming students are career changers or simply seeking to grow within their current industry function  it s critical to take a step back and think about their motivators for pursuing a graduate degree  for example  the specific things  whether it s traveling  writing detailed reports or reconciling financial statements  that you did not enjoy about your last job are probably not going to be any more enjoyable just because you can command a higher salary or title with an mba  the students are presented with a relatively rare opportunity to re direct their career toward things they actually enjoy doing  as long as they are also able to convince an employer to hire them to do those things </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i believe too many incoming students focus on employment statistics or starting salaries in a particular area  while ignoring the long term career implications  as stated earlier  an mba can provide the basis to completely redirect one s career  but it s only one part of the process  students who have a clear sense of their strengths and weaknesses  as well as an understanding of what ignites their passion  will find it much easier to weed through the options that are going to present themselves and sell themselves effectively in the marketplace </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students who also recognize that they will need to put in significant effort both inside and outside of the classroom to network within a new industry or function are usually the most successful career changers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the practical side  i recommend that incoming students begin to read the relevant business journals and reports and follow the business news media to develop a point of view on current business topics  if they are not already doing so   this activity will not only help you to acquire a business vocabulary but will also allow you to converse intelligently on topics that can impact interactions with recruiters or alumni  if you say that you are interested in trading stocks  for example  but can t succinctly describe your current market view when asked  it will be a short conversation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a final suggestion is that if you are considering a field where the gmat score is well known as a screening tool by recruiters  most often consulting   the time to consider re taking your gmat to boost your score is before you begin your studies </paragraph>

  <title>admissions director ankur kumar resigns from upenn s wharton school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the admissions director at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school will leave her post this friday  october  th  according to an email sent by wharton dean tom robertson to the school s faculty and staff this morning  the wall street journal also reported the news  noting that the school had declined its requests for comment but that according to several sources kumar informed her staff of her decision last week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a wharton alumna  kumar has been a member of the admissions team for the past four years  serving since      as director of admissions and financial aid  in his email announcing her departure  dean robertson praised kumar for helping the school reach unprecedented female enrollment  women now number more than     of the student body  as well as for introducing several innovations in admissions  including the  team based discussion   a group interview format launched last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite these innovations  wharton s application volume has dropped    percent over the last four years  according to a wsj article last week  kumar and school officials contend that the lower application figures  combined with a stronger applicant pool and a higher percentage of accepted applicants who enroll  prove that her team has done a better job of targeting candidates  dissenters  including the wsj  argue that the drop off signals wharton s slip from its long held position as one of the top three mba programs in the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>maryellen lamb  wharton s deputy vice dean of mba admissions  financial aid and career management  will guide the admissions team upon kumar s departure  according to dean robertson s email to faculty  lamb  who previously served as director of the school s career services department  was promoted to deputy vice dean last month </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wsj noted that wharton has had three admissions directors since       when rose martinelli left to head up admissions at the university of chicago booth school of business </paragraph>

  <title>wharton needs to better showcase what s right with wharton</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>swirling debate picked up this week in the realm of top mba programs  fueled by a wall street journal article on friday entitled   what s wrong with wharton   the journal piece hinged on a notable    percent drop in applications to the university of pennsylvania s wharton school over the past four years  against a backdrop of gains in application volume by several other top schools in the same time period  wharton s drop did seem to beg the question of what s wrong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the journal article suggests that behind the falling application volume is the fact that wharton   with its indisputable strength in finance   didn t shift quickly enough or significantly enough in the wake of the financial crisis to attract students more drawn to post mba careers in fields like technology and entrepreneurship  the journal also called attention to wharton s slide in several top mba rankings  the philadelphia school has for the past several years consistently finished behind the university of chicago booth school of business  harvard business school and stanford graduate school of business rather than holding steady as one of the top three business schools in the world </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton dean of admissions and financial aid ankur kumar contends that the decline in application volume  combined with a stronger applicant pool and a higher percentage of accepted applicants who enroll  proves that she and her team are doing a better job targeting candidates   our focus is on the quality of our applicant population  and that remains as high as ever   she told the journal  pointing out that the average gmat score for the class of      was a record setting      poetsandquants  which ran a lengthy rebuttal article to friday s journal piece  also noted that mba graduates from wharton this year had one of the best placement records in the school s history  with      percent of the class receiving job offers within three months of graduation and median base salaries rising to           up        from the year before </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for its part  the poetsandquants piece suggests that wharton s stock is undervalued  yes  there has been a drop in application volume  and yes  wharton has slid in the rankings  but the school continues to deliver an incredible mba education and will remain on the short list of the very top management programs in the world   those negatives may well be a reason to apply to the school s prestigious mba program right now   writes p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a third perspective comes in the form of an article posted on linkedin over the weekend by wharton management professor adam grant  which documents many ways in which wharton has expanded in recent years beyond the constraints of its reputation as a finance school  with substantive initiatives and resources that are drawing a wider and wider array of students  grant points out that of the    percent of the most recent graduating class who accepted job offers within three months of graduation     percent went into consulting  compared with only    percent who went into investment banking  venture capital  private equity and technology have also been drawing a greater percentage of graduates  most notable  grant argues  has been a spike in entrepreneurship  in the last six years  the number of wharton students starting a business upon graduation has  jumped from     percent to     percent  which  incidentally  is greater than the   percent of hbs students who start a business upon graduating  for what it s worth  wharton last year had more than    graduates starting their own business  compared to stanford gsb s     grant adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perhaps what s wrong with wharton is that it just hasn t gotten the message out about what it s doing right  as grant s article points out  wharton is doing a lot of great things to add to a program that has long been one of the world s top choices for graduate management education  at the same time  the fact that application volume has dropped can t be disputed  giving credence to pandq s assertion that the school s stock is currently undervalued  with the arrival of a new dean in the fall  wharton faces an important opportunity to clarify for all stakeholders that its program hasn t actually faltered but instead has pivoted in directions that will only strengthen it in the future </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit chats with dean bob bruner of uva s darden school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>when bob bruner  dean of the darden graduate school of business administration at the university of virginia  casually mentioned getting together over a cup of tea in philadelphia last month  clear admit jumped at the chance  it s not every day that the dean of a top ranked mba program proposes meeting up   in our own city no less  it would turn out to be just a part of what makes bruner unlike some other deans </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a member of the darden faculty since      and its dean since       bruner has long promoted darden s commitment to high engagement teaching and to fostering a collaborative community oriented ethic among its students  his efforts have won him multiple leading teaching awards at the university of virginia and within the commonwealth of virginia  as well as designation as       dean of the year  by forbes cnn money and poetsandquants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bruner has long set himself apart as a dean who blogs and tweets regularly  hoping to share his unique perspectives with a wider audience   there are few deans that blog about their own work or the world around them or higher education   he told us   i think that s a shame  i think deans have a lot to say that could inform the way all the stakeholders at business schools engage their schools and shape expectations about the schools  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for more on what bruner has to say   on topics ranging from gender equity and the mba to growth in massive open online courses  moocs  to the ways graduate management education must adapt to and embrace globalization   read on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit  tell us about charlottesville  what are the advantages and disadvantages to having a business school there </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bob bruner  the straightforward answer is it is a tremendous town to live in for two years plus  many people come to darden  want to come to study with us and want to stay  so it is attracting its own entrepreneurial community  other darden alums study at darden  go away and work  and then they want to come back after five         years and set up businesses  so we have a thriving tech industry  private equity community  asset management community   and the university and the darden school are helping to be a nexus of those groups  we have an incubator  we have a very  very successful innovation and entrepreneurship institute  the batten institute  and we just started a center for asset management that attracts professional asset managers and the like  so it is a lovely town anointed by no less than usa today as the most desirable small town to live in </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i was cornered about a year and half ago by a broadcast journalist  i was literally in a corner  she thrust a microphone in my face  with a cameraman behind her  and said   you know  i live in manhattan  i could get an mba from a dozen schools there  and they are more convenient  i could stay in my own apartment  continue my own circle of friends  and i wouldn t have to work as hard because everyone knows how rigorous darden is  why  why oh why  would i leave manhattan to go all the way up to the foothills of the blue ridge mountains to attend darden  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i asked her   when you like to dine out  where do you like to eat   this was one of those eyes glaze over moments and i thought she was going to tell the cameraman to turn off the camera  but she took the bait  she said  well because i am constantly chasing news stories i eat where i can when i can  but what i really like are those intimate little restaurants where the ingredients are fresh that day  recipes are original  service is just so  presentation is excellent  the wine list is superb i walk out of those little hole in the wall restaurants with an absolutely new attitude about food   she went on at considerable length  i said that s what darden is like </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darden is a destination school  it is not necessarily the easiest  most convenient or least expensive  but it is a school to which you would go if you really want to change your life in professional ways and  in fact  in even deeper ways  we specialize in helping students discover what they are strong at and helping them find their ways into those careers  many of our alums will describe darden as an absolutely transformative experience  it changed their lives   they thought they were going to pursue one career but instead took a    degree turn into something else  it s a very common testimonial i get </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the charlottesville community is kind of a metaphor for the experience within darden  so darden is relatively smaller than what people would regard as our peer schools   we have about     students per class in the full time program     in the executive mba  emba  and    in the global executive mba  gemba   we do a great deal in the way of collaborative work among students  because the class sizes are relatively smaller   literally  even the classrooms are smaller than many of our peer schools   and the student body is smaller  the students all get to know each other  there is a very collaborative community oriented ethic in our culture  we don t like to get ahead by scoring off of other people  climbing over the backs of others  it s much more   come on everybody  here s the way to solve this problem   and people chip in and say   and i can improve on that  and i can do this   and so on  it trains our students to be managers and leaders and to bring the best out of teams </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so i hear from the companies who recruit at darden that they especially value our students for their practicality  their grounded ness  their ability to hit the ground running  they don t take a year to burn in  to shed the lofty theoretically approaches that they may have learned  they play well in the sandbox  they contribute well to teams  they help lead teams and get the best out of team based work  they communicate well  if you participate in     case study discussions over the course of two years you are bound to be able to develop an ability to express ideas and recommendations  and we have a very strong emphasis on business ethics and the role of integrity in being able to lead well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how much of that emphasis is a response to the recent crisis and how much of that has been in place for some time   bb  we were one of the leaders in establishing a required graded course in business ethics  and that was back in the     s  we have an extremely strong business ethics faculty  regarded as among the world s leaders in this area  i think the crisis really brought out  certainly stimulated in my heart  a very deep reflection about the purpose of business schools and the impact on not only the lives of individuals   the students   but also the corporations and other organizations where we send our students  i know other deans i have spoken with have experienced the same reflective kind of process  it s pretty clear that the world wants different managers and leaders than what you see in  mad men    or some of the other very popular  power oriented shows  indeed  i don t think that works very well  we discovered that being able to lead a diverse team   not a team of five bob bruners  but a team differing by gender  race  national origin  sexual orientation  etc    is an unusual skill  and ordinarily it leads to better insights and outcomes than some kind of command and control approach </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  speaking of  mad men  and diversity  you saw the new york times piece on gender equity at harvard business school  what is it like to be a female student at darden </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i read that article with humility  and i think all deans in privacy of conversations among deans would acknowledge that there s a lot about student life that occurs outside of the radar screen of deans  in some ways  that s a reflection on the limited scope of rationality  our ability to absorb facts and details about student experience  it is also respectful in that many of our students are in their late   s and they have private lives   thank you very much dean  but don t go there  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i should acknowledge that i received my mba and doctorate from hbs  my mba was back in the   s  and i graduated from the doctoral program in       i didn t see that  gender class inequity  when i was there  the article is causing a fair amount of processing  i m trying to understand the gender aspects but also the socio economic aspects  it s the latter that stimulates a lot of my thinking this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but the gender issues are nontrivial  harvard is about three times darden s size and it s a comparison of apples and oranges  i leave it to you to infer or to talk to the people at harvard about their experiences  but we don t put up with the kind of steamrolling that the article implied   not only for women but for other groups   in the sense that class discussions are dominated by white males or people who have industry experience  etc  our faculty are really trained to bring out students from a variety of perspectives  honestly i think that leads to better discussions of case problems  more importantly i think it models the kind of leadership that we inspire our students to demonstrate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the reasons that i like to teach by the case method is that in a sense what we teach is how we teach  we are teaching the students to lead by questioning others  rather than command and control  telling one s employees to do it this way  not that way  instead we teach by reasoning with them and saying   how do you suppose a customer experiences the engagement with our business when you just set the tea down as compared to when you put down the cup and pour the tea and offer it up nicely   that questioning process is the characteristic of leaders at some wonderful firms  as an example  gortex comes to mind  the founder of the company was a revolutionary in his style of leadership of his management team and indeed of his employee base  he rarely gave commands or orders but instead quite typically would say   let s think this through   another example is johnsonville sausage in wisconsin </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think the notion is that we are trying to model a way of addressing business problems and doing it in a way that is collaborative and brings out the best of everybody in the workforce  maybe even in the customers  the suppliers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  you have been a tweeter and a blogger for quite some time  is that personality or strategy of a combination of both  are you an early adopter by nature </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i have been blogging since       i do it in large part because i want to bring a set of ideas and a perspective to an audience that i don t readily see in the world  now  every writer wants to believe that he or she has something absolutely different and special to say   so what i just said i say with a degree of humility  but there are few deans that blog about their own work or the world around them or higher education  i think that s a shame  i think deans have a lot to say that could inform the way all the stakeholders at business schools engage their schools and shape expectations about the schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we have about        alumni spread all over the world  and though we have numerous means of communicating with our alums  none of them are quite as spontaneous or personalized as the blogs and tweets  so i do it to reach the wider community </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what event  change  or development at darden are you most excited about in the year ahead </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  gosh  we have a passel of possibilities i could tell you about  i can tell you that right now we are in the midst of the delivery of two new moocs  massive open online courses   last spring we delivered three through coursera  and this fall we have two new ones  one is a course   introduction to strategy   by michael lennox  a senior member of our faculty  a real enterprising colleague  he taught a strategy course last spring and has carried it forward this year and added more bells and whistles  it is an example of a course that is taking the canon of ideas in strategy and digitizing it through the mooc  he has        registrants   i don t even need to ask mike lennox  but i am quite confident that right there are more students than he has ever taught face to face in his accumulated career to date  but let s also acknowledge that only a   th will actually complete the course  submit the coursework  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there s another course being taught by ed freeman   capitalism and society   freeman is a leading business ethicist  and i have had people reach out to me spontaneously to tell me how both courses are rocking their world  they are taking one or both  they are either alums or people in the business world  and they have to bubble about these courses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school is giving these courses for free  and the students evidently like it  students are spontaneously organizing study groups in places like pakistan  argentina  the uk  new york city   to get together at coffee shops and talk about the content of that week and what they have learned   let s compare  let s make sure we really understand what s going on  etc   so there is a social media element to these courses that is really powerful  we are going to do something with that idea   i am not going to elaborate   but the opportunity for a not for profit educational institution like ours to have that kind of impact in the lives of students around the world is huge  and i am eager for us to begin to harness that  the tech  the moocs  would be a big element of what we are doing </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the second thing coming up this year   predating the new york times article last sunday   is that we have organized two tiger teams  tiger teams are what we call groups of people on our faculty and staff who organize around particular topical issues intensively to develop opportunities or problems and offer up recommendations  which we then incorporate into our curriculum or practices as a school  we have two tiger teams together calling themselves the  initiative on women  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first is working on adopting some best practices that will enhance the educational experience of women at the darden school  this does indeed look at patterns of participation and calling by professors and the like  but it goes well beyond it  because what our students experience at the darden school is an extraordinary blend of what happens in the classroom  as well as what takes place extracurricularly in clubs and social activities at the school  as well as ultra extracurricularly  in the social life well beyond the organizing limits of the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we for years have paid attention to student satisfaction surveys  and the satisfaction of white males has ordinarily exceed that of white women  underrepresented minorities  international students  i am pleased to say that in recent years the satisfaction levels of women and men have virtually converged because of our efforts through tiger teams like this </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think there is still more work to be done in the area of diversity  i am the eighth dean of darden  and i was the first to appoint a chief diversity officer  we have a very active diversity advisory group that comes in a couple times of year and talks to the whole leadership of the school about best practices in diversity and what we can do to raise our game </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the second tiger team in our initiative on women is for women alumni of the school who face a very different professional life of launching a career  maybe stopping out for children  maybe resuming back into business  the resumption of which is quite challenging  women who have stopped out a while face doubts  questions of self confidence and competence  if they don t go back into business they might start small firms or work for nonprofit organizations  do very intensive volunteer work and the like  all of these issues are related in part to work life balance  which have big implications for men  so we are also examining the experience of our male alums and filtering those insights back into our own curriculum  we would like to create experiences that sustain the professional lives of women alums of the darden school and ideally can tell men something new and then bring those insights back into our program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a third and final exciting element is our global outreach  we ordinarily deliver a dozen to    or    small global experiences for our mba students around the world  this involves taking them to lovely places like barcelona and elsewhere in western europe generally  for instance  as well as obvious places like china and india  as well as not so obvious places such as tunisia and south africa </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students today don t merely want to go and study in these distant places  increasingly they want to go work on business problems or opportunities to have social impact  these types of global experiences take quite a lot of effort to set up   i am cautiously optimistic that the range of global experiences we offer this year will be our best yet </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we are going to hold an economic forum   a one day conference in china  we will be taking a group of students to normandy  france  in may to walk through the normandy battlefields with some officers from the u s  marine corps to talk about the stressful leadership challenges the officers faced as part of the d day invasion  the officers of the u s  marines will take small groups of five to    students each on a strenuous walk around the battlefields and stop periodically and say   put yourself there in june       the wind is blowing at    knots an hour form the east  there s low cloud cover  you hear airplanes coming in  you are beginning to get shelled from this direction or that  it s been six hours since your men ate last  what will you do   through a repetitive discussion process throughout the day you have what amounts to a series of six to    mini case discussions  they put the students on the ground in a very authentic setting to reason through the leadership challenges that could meet any enterprise leader who has to worry about fulfilling the mission of the enterprise and yet leading and managing in ways that sustain the coherence of the team and the welfare of the group  all of those are examples of our work globally </paragraph>
    <paragraph>women  technology  and globalization will be three very important themes for us this coming year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what do you worry prospective applicants may not know about darden  what do you want to highlight   bb  because i have studied at many business schools and i have followed our peer schools very closely  i would say that the number one error of applicants is to assume that schools are substitutes for one another  that a learning experience at school a is like one at school b or school c  the mistake is to believe that all mba diplomas are equal   to shrug your shoulders and just take one or another  don t worry about it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>big  big mistake  i know enough schools well from the inside to be able to say that   even among the most elite schools   the experience differs tremendously based upon the differences in culture of the school and a host of other things  the infrastructure  the setting  the resources available  to fight this notion that schools are easy substitutes for one another  i encourage applicants to get on the ground and simply observe what the different schools are like  any school that you would intend to spend two years and a lot of money and a lot of hard work on really ought to be the focus of a great deal of investigation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a great learning experience can tee you up for extraordinary discovery and success  it might save you from years spent walking down the wrong path that you might later regret  it can frame participation in a wider community that could have lasting impact  so you need to figure out what feels right  and the only way to do that is to get on the ground and do the investigation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  do you find that your applicant pool is fairly self selecting  have the majority of applicants done a good job of identifying what makes darden darden </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i am reasonably confident that the applicant pool comes to darden knowing that darden is darden  i say that because we are pretty transparent about what it is that makes darden different from virtually all of our peer schools  our admissions receptions are quite different experiences  the presence we create in the digital sphere is quite different  we have youtube episodes that demonstrate a case study discussion  people can check out some of our best teachers by looking at moocs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  how much attention do you personally pay to the admissions process  admissions trends </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i am pretty involved in that i engage with the admissions director pretty frequently  participate very actively in the admissions events that we hold and engage with prospective applicants  but the conditional clause is that no dean can possibly hope to see the entire range of the applicant pool  we have between eight and nine applicants for every seat in our class  it is tempting for any dean to look over the shoulder of the admissions director and say   do this  not that   i think that s a formula for great error  if a dean needs to intervene to that extent i m not sure why the dean would need an assistant dean of admissions  the other thing is that i spend so much time in other directions as well  engaging with corporate sponsors  faculty  our parent university  that were i to devote too much time to the admissions process i would be neglecting some other important responsibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  does darden place particular focus on the partners its students may bring with them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  we have a big focus on partners  and it is quite consistent with our ethic of close collaboration and strong community  we have a very strong darden partners association  and we actively work to assist partners in employment  it is more challenging to find employment  particularly if you have a very high level of expertise  with central virginia being  well  smaller  this needs to be part of the application calculus for any prospective applicant  if you have a partner  it is important from the get go to think about what the partner s experience will be over those two years  and if the partner needs employment  that should be on the radar from the very start  but our darden partners association works very hard to boost and sustain and support partners </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for students who are part of a family  not just a pair   so where there are children present   charlottesville is really an outstanding place  because of the strong influence of the university of virginia there is a deep sense of a community of trust  it is a safe community  it is beautiful  you don t spend hours getting from point a to point b  but there are also real stores with lots of interesting goods in them  all the requisite services  we are close to richmond  va  about an hour away  which is a city of about half a million people  and then washington  dc  is two hours away  some partnerships divide their time and live in the middle between washington  dc  and charlottesville  so it s not impossible by any means </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  some schools are trending away from essays as part of the application process or are looking for ways of getting a more candid  unedited view of students a part of the admissions process  where does darden fall in that   bb  we now rely on one essay  we are still looking for a demonstration of an applicant s written communication skill because we still think that s important  even though in the digital age with tweets of     characters what passes for written communication can be pretty  shall we say  casual </paragraph>
    <paragraph>interviews matter a whole lot to us  for many reasons  not least of which is that from our international students we are looking for a clear demonstration of mastery of english and indeed americanized english  our case discussions go rapidly   the international students who thrive at darden are those fluent enough to catch humor  irony and emotion and to be able to respond fluidly to the give and take of the discussion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>letters of recommendation still matter to us  the quality of the letter and the familiarity of the writer with the applicant are highly influential  too many letters of recommendation are shallow   i am the ceo of the corporation  johnny or susie has been employed with us for four years   and then just banalities   he or she showed up at      a m  isn t that nice   that s not good enough  applicants should look for recommenders who will say something authentic and substantive  the best observations are based on personal direct familiarity rather than second  or third hand reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  what haven t we touched on that you want to share with clear admit s readers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  i would offer a few comments about our executive format programs  we have an executive mba  emba  and a global executive mba  gemba   they are both hybrid programs in that a material percentage      to    percent   of the program is online  either synchronous or asynchronous  and the balance is in person  our emba is seven years old and our gemba is going on three years old  our emba was just ranked   th   by us news  i think </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these programs are aimed at people who want to remain in the workforce not just because they want to get a steady paycheck but typically because they are in positions of such responsibility that they want to keep contributing to their organization and retain the career momentum that they have with that organization </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what we hear is that the hybrid structure works extremely well  which is a big learning for us because we are known for case method teaching  for our strong faculty  for face to face engagement  for strong community  and it may not seem obvious at first that we can obtain those same outcomes in the hybrid structure as we do in the full time program  but we do  so i am seeing student evaluation averages that equal or exceed what we see in the full time program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the emba has one international residency   all the rest of the residencies are in charlottesville  the gemba has an outstanding difference in that the face to face experiences are conducted in six residencies  they start in charlottesville and washington in one two week experience  students then take classes online  then we bring them together again  say to china  then more online  then to brazil  india  europe  france usually  and then we bring them back to the u s  it is a full time program     months  the global program is especially aimed at executives who have awakened to the fact that their futures hinge tremendously on cross borders activity  we are delighted with the response  both the rankings and the student evaluations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i would conclude by reemphasizing that what makes darden different in all three programs   full time  emba and gemba   is the way we teach  which is heavily and highly engaging  this isn t passive learning by any stretch  this is rolling up your sleeves and sorting out the problems and puzzling your way through to a set of recommendations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second  it s the faculty  our faculty are experts in a wide variety of fields  and they care immensely about excellent teaching </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the third is community   the bonding that takes place  and that s because we are in charlottesville  we are a smaller program  and we intentionally aim to produce a culture of collaboration and mutual learning  i think these are huge distinctions in the field of mba education </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i have deep respect for all of our peer schools  and i don t mean to imply that what they offer is less worthy  but what the world is telling us is   both in terms of the sheer volume of applicants and the quality of the applicant pool  as well as the companies who come to recruit at the school   is that they like what they see and they want to work with us </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  so being in charlottesville hasn t presented a challenge in terms of recruiting </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bb  last year we had about     companies visiting our grounds  given the size of our student body  that is a lot  plus we are very active in helping students engage in off grounds recruiting through digital media   skype and other platforms   as well as with treks  we organize large group travel experiences to silicon valley  new york city  china  india  europe </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i think something we are good at is helping students prepare for the recruiting experience  when i was an mba student   which is a long time ago   the recruiting experience was mainly one of  figure it out for yourself  send off a lot of letters to see if you can get on a list to interview   today we train students very actively in shaping their own career development exploration  search process  recruitment process  we have a very active career development center that invites students in  works with them  coaches them through the entire year  and this has led to a high placement rates in the past few years  i am proud to say </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i am a faculty member   i don t want to believe that the only reason students come to business school is to get a job  i believe they come to business school to get an education  which leads to a job  but we are a professional school  and part of preparing mbas for the profession they are entering is to help them understand that over the course of their entire career they may have a dozen different employers  the process we take them through is one grand rehearsal for what they may experience again and again throughout their careers </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley haas school of business to offer new and retooled online classes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>following its pilot last year of a range of new online courses for its mba students  the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley is expanding its online offerings while also reworking some of the initial courses based on feedback from students and professors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the three pilots offered online last year was  power and politics   a popular mba course taught by professor cameron anderson  this year  the course will be offered again  but with a revamped website and platform designed to be more intuitive to use  faster download times are also expected to improve the student experience  allowing for conversation that  mimics the in person experience as much as possible  with back and forth and even spontaneous interjections   anderson said as part of an article on the haas website  he noted that he got to hear from many more people as part of the online version of the class  through online class discussions and chats </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students in the  power and politics  pilot  too  praised the advantages the new course delivery method presented   with the web based format  we had forums that allowed much deeper discussions than in class conversations  and we had games and simulation tools that illustrated  power and politics  concepts in a more interactive fashion   said philip tam  mba     who took the course last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among the new online course offerings this year will be a hybridized version of  social media marketing   taught by assistant professor zsolt katona  in two sections of the course this fall  katona will use web based technology to deliver one third of the course material  teaching the balance in the classroom  by videotaping and editing some of his lectures  katona notes that he can produce better quality material  which students can access with greater flexibility   students can stop it anytime  ask questions and discuss it among themselves   he says  adding that ensuing online discussions will allow him to hear opinions from everyone in class and incorporate them back into group discussion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to adam berman  executive director of online initiatives at haas  online learning opportunities will continue to expand  to this end  the school plans to hire a new digital program manager  in addition  abby scott  who formerly held leadership roles in mba career management and executive education  has been appointed associate director of online initiatives </paragraph>
    <paragraph>berman  for his part  is happy to see an online transformation gain footing   just as we ve seen technology and globalization transform other sectors over the last two decades  these same forces are now in the early stages of transforming higher education   he said   education is one of the last areas of life to synch with our  digital native  population of students who already live their lives through technology  </paragraph>

  <title>applicant volume for full time mba programs on the rise</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a majority of u s  business schools reported year over year growth in full time mba applicant volume for the first time since       according to new data from the graduate management admissions council  gmac   for the class that started this year  the median number of applications for full time  two year mba programs rose by nearly    percent worldwide  gmac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac  which administers the gmat entrance exam  surveyed     graduate programs at     schools worldwide for its latest application trends survey  the results of which were released yesterday  application volume increased at    percent of two year programs responding to the survey  up from    percent a year ago  interest in one year mba programs also climbed  with    percent of programs surveyed reporting a rise in applicant volume this year over last  as compared to    percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in      and       early in the great recession  there was impressive growth in the proportion of full time mba programs showing application increases   lawrence rudner  gmac vice president for research and development  said in a statement   in      and       there was a subsequent decline  but full time programs began to rebound in      and look even sturdier today  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>u s  schools  for their part  reported a median   percent gain in applications to full time  two year programs  growth in international applicants accounted for much of the application gains at u s  schools  gmac reports  noting that    percent of the programs had more international applicants this year than last  helping to compensate for the fact that    percent reported fewer domestic applicants year over year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several top u s  business schools were among those reporting jumps in application volume this year  including columbia business school  cbs   where applications rose by     percent  according to the wall street journal  last year  in contrast  applications to cbs s full time mba program dropped a staggering    percent   we are optimistic about where our application trends are going   cbs spokesman evan nowell told the journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one year mba programs in the united states also saw significant gains  according to the gmac survey  among one year programs responding to the survey     percent reported application volume increases this year over last  applications to the one year program at cornell university s johnson school of management  for example  jumped by a third  to      the journal reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>part time mba programs   at least those in the united states   didn t fare as well in the past year  among u s  part time programs  only    percent reported increased or steady application volume in       last year     percent of u s  part time programs reported increases  european part time programs had a stronger year  with    percent reporting increasing or stable application volumes compared to      </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school admissions continues transparency trend with note to round   applicants</title>

    <paragraph>applicants who submitted an application earlier this week as part of harvard business school  hbs  s round   received a prompt confirmation email direct from dee leopold  hbs director of admissions and financial aid  in it  leopold continued hbs s increasing trend toward transparency in the admissions process by spelling out in clear  down to earth terms just want applicants should expect from this point forward </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a senior team will begin reviewing submitted applications within a day or so of the september   th round   deadline  leopold wrote  and this team will make decisions about who moves forward and who doesn t </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  moving forward  means being invited to interview   leopold explained  adding that she expects interview invitations to be issued in early october and interviews to be conducted from mid october through november    not moving forward  means that we are unable to admit you   leopold continued   we want you to be able to move ahead with other plans so we will send these decisions out in october  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a third group of round   applicants may be asked to remain under consideration  for review again with round   applicants   we call that  further consideration  and the details will be communicated to this group in mid october   leopold wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold asked round   applicants to refrain from submitting any additional materials at this point  except for those students who need to send official gmat or gre score reports   if we re missing something  which is unlikely  we ll contact you via email   leopold said  she added that her team will begin reviewing applications with self reported test scores while awaiting official scores from the gmat or gre </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold s note  as well as its tone  represent a shift in recent years by hbs toward providing greater transparency and insight into the admissions process for applicants  a departure for a school that had a history of being much more opaque  now  the boston school is setting itself apart from several of its peers by sharing an increasing level of detail with applicants throughout the process </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school tackles entrenched issues of gender inequity</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  dean nitin nohria has  for the past two years  been leading a school wide effort to foster greater success among female mba students by making changes to the school s curriculum  rules and social rituals  according to a recent front page story in the new york times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs for years has seen women enter the school with the same test scores and grades as their male counterparts  only to quickly fall behind  the school has also struggled to attract and retain female professors  so in       the times reports  harvard  first female president  drew gilpin faust  appointed dean nohria  who pledged to address the gender relations issue head on  two years in  the school reports remarkable gains among women  though some of the changes implemented by the administration have met with opposition and hostility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the effort to remake gender relations at hbs  nohria and his team stationed stenographers in classrooms to prevent biased grading  gave untenured female professors private coaching  launched mandatory discussions about sexual harassment and complemented the time honored case study method with a new course  field  which groups students into problem solving teams </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after two years of these and other changes  the grades of female students rose significantly  and the teaching scores of female professors also shot up  according to the times report   by graduation  the school had become a markedly better place for female students  according to interviews with more than    professors  administrators and students  who cited more women participating in class  record numbers of women winning academic awards and a much improved environment   read the times article  indeed  for the first time in the school s history  almost    percent of the george f  baker scholars   a venerated honor awarded to the top   percent of the class   were women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nonetheless  some hbs students characterized the efforts of nohria and his administration as anywhere from off putting to  a painful experience   the times reported  and the project has revealed numerous entrenched issues to which solutions remain elusive  including the degree to which female students often feel they have to choose between academic and social success and the ways in which wealth  or the lack thereof  influences the experience of hbs students of both genders </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we made progress on the first level things  but what it s permitting us to do is see  holy cow  how deep seated the rest of this is   frances frei  hbs administrator and chairwoman of the first year curriculum  told the times  the deans have vowed to carry on the experiment  though they would not say how aggressively  nohria  for his part  told the times that he has been guided throughout by the phrase   sunshine is the best disinfectant  </paragraph>

  <title>former ross adcom member and newest clear admit admissions counselor shares his view on mba admissions</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this month clear admit welcomed a new member to its team of admissions counselors  jon fuller spent four years as senior associate director of admissions at the ross school of business at the university of michigan  fuller s experience in a top program s admissions office gave him many opportunities to assess candidates and determine their fit with ross  clear admit s blog readers are certain to enjoy the interview we recently conducted with jon  which you can find below </paragraph>
    <paragraph>could you describe what goes on behind the scenes during the ross application review process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there will be a number of changes to the review process in            given that ross is more fully rolling out the group exercise component of the evaluation process   before i left ross  we had a lot of conversations about how the timing would work out and how the new component would impact how applications are reviewed  but there was still much to be decided about how the steps would all come together   regardless  much of what i ll describe is still accurate and you can review soojin s blog for updates about the process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after the application deadline  all application information is downloaded into the university s database  and a large volume of information is loaded into a spreadsheet   just about everything but the narrative responses like essays and recommendation letters   it s an excel junkie s dream        every candidate has a row on the spreadsheet  and the document has grown to have well over     columns of information   the information ranges from fundamental things like your name  but also lists recent companies and titles  length of post grad work experience  undergraduate graduate programs  majors  and gpas   every detail about your standardized test performance  demographic information  citizenship and resident status  career interests  evaluation status  contact information  dual degree status   the list goes on   from that  we constructed tons of pivot tables to quickly and easily monitor the review process  get applicant pool profile information  etc </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this spreadsheet is also utilized at the beginning of the assessment process to help sort the candidates into three main categories  i definitely want to know more  so let s interview  i m not sure if i want to interview  so let s take closer look to determine  and i really don t think this person is competitive and will likely be denied   the first two categories tended to be the substantial part of the applicant pool with the last category being very small   it d take me a number of days to review all of the candidates  classify them  and then have the results vetted by the director </paragraph>
    <paragraph>all of the candidates are getting additional evaluations of their application materials with a team of experienced outside readers and or associate directors   essays  recommendations  etc   even those of the least competitive candidates  receive a thorough review regardless  our associate dean and director thought that was very important to do this to help avoid missing folks who  at a high level  might not look as competitive as others </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first two categories of candidates have every word of the application read and summarized by the outside readers   the associate directors then review those summaries  with a particular emphasis on spending more time with the resume and recommendations   if someone hasn t been invited to interview yet  the outside reader summaries are leveraged to help make the determination whether or not to interview   once a completed interview report comes in from the alumni or student interviewer  the associate directors integrate the interview comments with the rest of the application materials   they then make a recommendation to admit  waitlist  or deny </paragraph>
    <paragraph>historically  ross has invited candidates to interview in two main waves   the first wave consists of the  let s interview  candidates from the initial review of the spreadsheet   the second wave consists of those who were flagged for an interview as a result of the detailed review by the outside reader team and the associate directors   the two waves tended to be fairly balanced in size  but this year there will likely be one large wave  followed by a small clean up later in the round   the large wave will likely come a little bit later in the round than in previous years since the invitees will come from the initial spreadsheet review and the outside reader associate director review   the reason for the change is to help ensure that as many of the interview invitees as possible have the opportunity to attend a group exercise event </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once all of these individual recommendations were completed by the associate directors  i would review all of the decisions in their totality and make adjustments to ensure that the class was shaping up to have our desired overall profile   i would then forward them to the director  where she would take that refinement to another level  and then finally  she would forward on our decisions to the dean s office for final approval </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what was the most common pitfall or mistake you saw applicants make over the four years you were on the admissions team at ross  what advice would you give in regards to that pitfall or mistake </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the most classic mistake would be candidates  who on a high level review  appeared to be very competitive and a good potential fit for the school  but when you started to look deeper  they hadn t done their due diligence in researching the program and hadn t customized their application materials to the school   that lack of research most frequently appeared in the  why ross  related essays and or in the interview   it s a competitive application process  and if you can t show fit to a program or show that you re passionate about the school  even the strongest candidate is going to have trouble being admitted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what part of the job did you enjoy the most   while i supervised ross  overall recruitment and admissions process  i was also in charge of our diversity initiatives   i really enjoyed getting to know management leadership for tomorrow fellows and consortium for graduate study in management candidates   it was very rewarding to help those candidates put their best foot forward in the application process through our on campus events and in participating with those organizations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what part did you dread   the waitlist process over the summer   i was in charge of reviewing our waitlist pool  deciding who to offer admission to  etc   it was especially tough since you re trying to gear up for the next admissions cycle while  at the same time  finishing up the current cycle   for those that you admit in the summer  on the one hand  you re giving them exactly what they wanted   admission to your program   but on the other hand  you re probably turning someone s life upside down </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while i didn t know it at the time  a few years ago one of my waitlisted candidates had essentially given up hope of being admitted  so he decided to move to hawaii  not a bad place to work on reapplying    when i called him with the offer  he had just moved there  found an apartment  etc   he had to think about it for a minute  but he decided to enroll and had to shift gears again to move back to the mainland   fortunately  i got a hold of him a few hours before he purchased a car       that happened to another waitlisted candidate   i called this other candidate as he was literally driving a new mercedes off of the dealer s lot   he tried to return it  but the dealer wouldn t do allow it   he had a pretty nice car relative to his classmates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>do you feel that there have been any major changes to the mba admissions landscape over your years at ross  changes for the better  changes for the worse   a big change has been the increase in one year program options and the decrease in overall mba applications to many us programs   many might read about lower numbers of candidates applying to top programs and may think that it s easier to get in as a result   however  the quality of the candidate pool hasn t really decreased  and in many ways  admission to top programs has become more and more competitive given how strong the pool is   i was always amazed about what our applicants had accomplished and what they wanted to do with their mba experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is your perspective on application timing  r  vs  r  vs  r   in general and in terms of ross specifically   in general and for ross  round   and round   should always be the first priority   while there are always people who will be admitted in round    things get much  much more competitive in the last round   for most programs  there usually isn t too much of a difference between the selectivity of round   and     to help determine which round is better for you  the simple answer is that you should apply when you feel that your application and your profile are at their strongest   rushing to get an application submitted by a round   deadline just to be in for round   is a poor decision </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you were the point person for applicants from the consortium for graduate study in management  what would you say the benefits of applying via the consortium are   if you are a us citizen or permanent resident who has experience supporting the mission of the consortium  you really shouldn t think twice about applying through their process   there are many benefits to applying through the consortium  most notably the common application  which can save you some significant time and money in applying to up to six of the consortium s member schools   if you re approved for membership to the consortium and end up enrolling at one of the consortium mba programs  you also have the opportunity to attend their annual orientation program  op   which is a massive career development program and fair that occurs before you enroll in your mba program   many people actually secure summer internship offers through op   before they ve actually started classes at their program   the other significant benefit is consideration for a consortium fellowship  which is a full tuition scholarship awarded by the consortium program that you ve been admitted to </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what do you consider the most important element of a compelling mba goals essay </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the important ingredients to this kind of essay are clarity of thought around your short  and long term goals  why it makes sense to pursue an mba at this point in your career in order to achieve those goals  and how the specific school in question will help make your goals a reality   my experience has been that candidates often miss the mark with the last element   they don t effectively show that they ve done their research on the program to show how it s a great fit for them  and as a result  the adcom may get the impression that they re just another program that the candidate is applying to rather than the candidate s top choice   given how competitive the process is  schools are more inclined to admit a candidate who conveys authentic enthusiasm about their program and its differentiating factors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>what is your overall philosophy for admissions consulting  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there is no such thing as a perfect applicant  but my goal is to develop an application strategy with you that will identify and maximize your strengths and make them stand out to the programs to which you re applying  all the while mitigating the weaknesses that inevitably exist </paragraph>

  <title>growing number of doctors pursue health focused mba degree at fuqua school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the number of doctors applying to the mba health sector management program at duke university s fuqua school of business is on the rise  in part a reaction to the passage of the affordable care act  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an average of    doctors has applied to the school s fulltime healthcare focused mba program each year between      and       up from    per year  on average  in the six years before that  the number of doctors applying to the executive mba program has also increased  to an average of    per year between      and       compared to    per year between      and       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the number of doctors applying to fuqua has increased  so too has the number of those admitted  since       an average of seven and    doctors have been admitted to the daytime and executive mba programs  respectively  the school reports  that s up from an average of five and    doctors  respectively  admitted to the two programs over the six years previous </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fuqua professor david ridley  who directs the health sector management program  cites several reasons that doctors can be more motivated to pursue an mba when the healthcare sector undergoes changes  as with implementation of the affordable care act  often they are looking to understand what the changes may mean for the practice of medicine  specifically  doctors come hoping to learn how to lead organizational change within an established organization or how to create their own entrepreneurial organization in response  he notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in other cases  doctors are spurred by changes in healthcare to pursue an mba because they want to remain in the sector but to stop practicing medicine  ridley notes  at the same time  students not previously in healthcare can be motivated to pursue a healthcare specific mba program because they want to be a part of big changes within the industry as they take place </paragraph>
    <paragraph> business education enables healthcare students to develop as leaders and entrepreneurs   ridley said in a statement   at the same time  healthcare students make the business school better by their concern for people and understanding of policy  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fuqua first introduced its health sector management program into the mba curriculum in       a record    first year students have enrolled as part of the daytime program s current incoming class  the school reports </paragraph>

  <title>at duke s fuqua school of business many roads lead to consulting</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>consulting firms make up six of the    top employers of graduates from duke university s fuqua school of business  and almost a full third     percent  of the      class accepted consulting jobs this past year  the school announced recently </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for three years in a row  deloitte has hired more duke mbas than any other employer  hiring    graduates from the most recent class  other consulting firms hiring multiple duke mbas include bain and company  mckinsey and company  boston consulting group  accenture llp and pricewaterhousecoopers llp  according to data gathered by fuqua s career management center  cmc   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sheryle dirks  fuqua associate dean for career management  noted that there are many different reasons duke mbas are drawn to consulting   consulting quickly and intimately exposes them to the greatest challenges companies and organizations face and offers them the chance to apply many of the frameworks and skills they learned in business school  often while working with clients in a variety of industries and at locations around the globe   she said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the latest cmc data on hiring  while still preliminary  also shows other top employers outside of consulting  including microsoft  citi  goldman sachs  amazon com  bank of america  merrill lynch and apple  the technology  in particular  showed growth this past year  with    percent of graduates accepting jobs in that industry  other top fields for duke mbas include financial services  consumer products and health </paragraph>

  <title>admissions tip  using rankings to your advantage</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>there are numerous sources that can knowledgeably rank the  top  mba programs   however  because business schools receive different rankings depending on the sources  criteria  it can be difficult to understand which are the  best  schools   therefore today we d like to talk about how b school applicants can use rankings to discover the  best  schools for them   although the general merits of each school are important  we also believe that it is important for mba applicants to rank schools based on their individual needs and interests   therefore we encourage students to use official mba school rankings in the following ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   use rankings to create a consensus   sources rarely have the exact same rankings as each other  and therefore trying to determine the  top five  schools can be frustrating   however  it s best to compile these different sources of rankings to form a consensus regarding the top schools   for example  if your target program is consistently listed in the top     regardless of its individual ranking among different sources  you should feel confident that it is regarded as a top school by industry professionals and future employers   you may not be able to pinpoint the ultimate  number one  school  but you will be able to distinguish between the different tiers of schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   consider individual rankings   mba applicants should assess schools based on how they will help them gain what they want from their business school experiences   therefore we urge you to ask yourself what matters most to you in an mba program   some applicants may value strict adherence to the case method more than the amount or size of research centers  whereas other applicants may want a large number of diverse student organizations or a strong joint degree program   looking at the individual criteria from which rankings are calculated may help you judge business schools based on the specific factors that matter most to you   for example  if you are interested in entrepreneurship  then perhaps you should consider applying to an mba program with a strong program in this field  even if it receives lower scores in other areas especially if these areas are not a main concern for you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>    think about where you want to go after business school   in addition to considering what you want to get out of your business school experience  you should think about how business school will help you pursue your future career   therefore  some important rankings to consider may be the number of internships students gain at a particular mba program or how many recruiters from different fields visit specific campuses   these rankings may be especially important if you need to follow a specific career path to achieve your career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to studying rankings  we encourage b school applicants to do further research in understanding the comparable merits of business schools  such as perusing admissions information  talking to professors and students  and visiting campuses   furthermore  we encourage applicants to check out our clear admit school guides  which offer detailed profiles of the leading mba programs   best of luck to those researching business schools </paragraph>

    <paragraph>gabelli noted that his own parents didn t have a formal education and that it was his great education that allowed him to succeed   in order to provide that type of education  schools need great facilities   he said in a statement   columbia business school is at a critical point in moving to manhattanville  and i figured i d help as much as i could to push it over the goal line  </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg school of management adds video essay  alters admissions deadlines</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this week  the kellogg school of management said that it will begin requiring a video essay as part of its           mba application  the school will also revert to a one part application  with a single set of deadlines  rather than the two part process it has used in recent years  these and other changes were first reported monday by poetsandquants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of the new video essay  students will be directed from the application to a landing page on a skype like platform where they will be asked a short question  according to a subsequent report in bloomberg businessweek  applicants will have one to two minutes to collect their thoughts and one to two minutes to record an answer  they can replay their answer and start over up to two times is they are dissatisfied  receiving a new question on each subsequent try  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we felt like this was a great opportunity to meet our applicants from wherever they might be in the world   kate smith  kellogg s assistant dean of admissions and financial aid  told p q   we felt that we were past the tipping point in terms of video technology and comfort with it   most applicants would have used skype or facetime   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new video essay will not replace the traditional interview as part of the kellogg application process  many of these interviews are conducted by second year students and alumni  and the video essay will give the admissions committee a chance to meet the candidate in a video format  smith said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg also has reverted to a one part application with a single set of deadlines  a simplification of the more complicated two part application it has employed in recent years  the posted deadlines are october   th for round    january  th for round   and april  nd for round    applicants can schedule an interview only once they have submitted their application  and submitting earlier can help applicants match for an interview faster  the school says  kellogg will use the same application and procedure for its part time and executive mba programs as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  in keeping with the trend among top business schools  kellogg has also this year reduced the number of written essays it requires  from four to three  and cut the total word count applicants will have to answer the questions  from      to      </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business webinar offers tips for applicants to new ms computer science mba joint degree</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  announced this past spring that it will offer a new ms computer science  mscs  mba joint degree program  and a recent webinar provides tips for prospective applicants looking to learn more about the program and its application requirements </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the webinar begins with mary oleksy  who oversees the joint and dual degree programs for the gsb  outlining some basics   the purpose of this degree program is going to be to provide an opportunity for computer scientists to develop necessary skills to be managers and entrepreneurs  and for technologically inclined business students to gain a solid background in computer science by combining these two degrees into a really focused and intentional approach   she says  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students in the three year  full time program will start with a year of core curriculum coursework at the gsb  followed by two years filled with a combination of mba electives and mscs required courses and electives  in total  the program consists of     units     from the gsb and    from computer science </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there are some admissions requirements specific to the joint degree program  which were also covered in the recent webinar  for one  the gre is required of all applicants to the joint mba mscs program  unlike applicants to the gsb alone  who can submit either gmat or gre scores   no prior work experience is required   applicants may apply and attend straight from college  olesky notes that stanford has set no specific class size for the new degree program   we are really looking for quality more than quantity   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the questions asked most often by participants in the webinar pertained to whether or not applicants must have a background in computer science  in response  jay subramanian  the director of graduate admissions at the computer science department  recommended that prospective applicants take the foundational courses for the department  listed on the first page of this pdf  at a nearby educational institution or online   these could help you in preparing to apply to the mscs program  particularly those who do not have a cs background or do not have strong analytical and quantitative skills  and are coming from more of the humanities and sciences background   subramanian says </paragraph>

  <title>tuition climbs at um s ross school of business  remains flat in uc system</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last month  the board of regents at the university of michigan approved a        increase per term for its full time mba program at the ross school of business  the tuition increase  which will take effect in the fall  represents a     percent rise for in state students and a   percent rise for out of state students  meanwhile  the board of regents for the university of california system earlier this week approved a proposal that rules out tuition hikes for that system s graduate business schools  at least for this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as reported by bloomberg businessweek on june   st  two members of the six person board at the university of michigan voted against the tuition hike   the continued raising of tuition is not sustainable   regent denise ilitch said in a statement   if we were as good at raising revenue streams as we are at raising tuition  our students would be far better off  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with the tuition increases  the total coast of the program for in state residents will now be almost           the cost of ross s executive mba program will also increase by         to          for residents and          for nonresidents  an increase of     percent and     percent  respectively  bloomberg bw reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in california  meanwhile  students at uc berkeley s haas school of business dodged a proposed     percent tuition hike  at least for another year  bloomberg bw reported earlier this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in november  outgoing uc president mark yudof proposed increases to the supplemental fees students pay in    graduate professional degree programs  including business programs  the proposed increase for mba students at haas was        on supplemental tuition of          california governor jerry brown called on yudof to revisit the proposed increases  calling them unseemly amid recent sales and income tax increases in the state </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the revised proposal  which was approved july   th  tuition hikes were limited to four new professional programs and four underfunded nursing programs  business school programs will be unaffected  bloomberg bw reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>uc spokesperson dianne klein called it a balancing act  telling bloomberg bw that going forward the other graduate programs will need additional revenue to maintain quality   you want to have a top notch program in order to attract the best graduate students  but you also don t want to price yourself out of the market  or alienate the people who make decisions about state funding for the university of california   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to klein  yudof concluded that most of the programs can get by for one year at existing fee levels  but that it is not a long term sustainable proposition </paragraph>

  <title>ucla anderson school of management to become financially self supporting</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning with the         academic year  the ucla anderson school of management will no longer rely on state funding but will instead be completely self supporting  the school reported last week  university of california president mark yudof approved the school s proposed status change for its full time mba program on june   th  ending a three year review process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the decision is expected to make it easier for the school to fund raise with its alumni and philanthropic donors  to make tuition fees more predictable and to give the school greater flexibility in faculty assignments  according to ucla anderson dean judy olian  who has led the campaign to win self supporting status for the school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> ucla anderson is well positioned for the future  and this change further enables us to address mba student and program needs   she said in a statement   we also believe that our alumni and friends will be energized by the clarity of the school s financial model  and its singular dependence on self generated funding and philanthropy  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> people are confused about what state support might be   olian told the financial times  noting that net state support covers only   percent of current tuition fees  she believes that knowing that there is no state funding at all will help  alumni and philanthropic donors to step up to the plate   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yudof approved the change in status because he believes the school will have  the same academic requirements  the same faculty  the same curricula  the same kinds of students  the same admissions requirements and the same academic delivery model   he wrote in a letter to ucla chancellor gene block  he did place a few conditions on his decision  including that student financial aid will continue to be available to students who need it at a level commensurate with other uc full time state supported mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more than    million in state support previously allocated to the program will now transfer to the university at large   in every other respect  ucla anderson remains a part of ucla exactly as before   olian said in a statement   we see this change benefiting both the university and ucla anderson  a creative strategy in response to declining funding from the state  </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler discusses finding the right mba fit with bloomberg businessweek</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a recent article about finding the right fit in a business school program  bloomberg businessweek turned to clear admit senior admissions counselor stacey oyler for some guidance </paragraph>
    <paragraph>oyler  who worked in admissions for dartmouth s tuck school of business and as a recruiter for mckinsey before joining clear admit  encouraged prospective applicants not to let a school s rank in the various mba rankings overshadow other important considerations  a top ranked school can help catch recruiters  eyes  but the school also needs to be the best match for what you want to do  oyler told bloomberg bw   it s two years and a significant financial investment   she said   so take the time to think about fit just as much as rank and reputation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ankur kumar  director of mba admissions and financial aid at the university of pennsylvania  also contributed to the bloomberg bw article  she stressed to prospective applicants that the choice of where to go to business school is a personal one that requires self reflection regarding what you want to get out a program  where you want to live for two years  how your academic and professional goals align with the school and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kumar pointed out that a school s admissions process can actually provide valuable indicators for candidates trying to determine fit  a given school s culture and values will often be reflected in the focus of its essay questions or in a unique component included in the admissions process  she told bloomberg bw  as an example  kumar noted that wharton recently added a team interview component to its application to assess how well suited candidates are to group projects  that s because wharton students take part in    to    team projects  on average during their mba program  she said </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley haas partners with mit sloan on energy efficiency research project</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>researchers at the haas school of management at the university of california at berkeley are teaming up with researchers at the mit sloan school of management to take a closer look at energy efficiency policies and regulations around the globe to determine whether they are realizing their full potential  the schools announced this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the project  called e e  is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the two schools designed to find the best way to go from using a large amount of energy   e   to a small of amount of energy   e    participating experts will include engineers  economists and others  and the initiative is led by catherine wolfram  associate professor and co director of the energy institute at haas  michael greenstone  a professor of environmental economics at mit  and christopher knittel  co director of the mit center for energy and environmental policy research  ceepr  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the collaboration is designed to measure the actual energy efficiency of given policies and regulation by leveraging cutting edge scientific and economic insights  the researchers say   the e e project is focused on singling out the best products and approaches by using real experiments centered on real buying habits  it will provide valuable guidance to government and industry leaders  as well as consumers   haas s wolfram said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mckinsey curve   a cost curve that shows that abating emissions actually pays for itself   serves as one of the group s motivations for studying energy efficiency   our goal is to better understand what the costs and benefits of energy efficient investments are where the low hanging fruit is  as well as how high that fruit is up the tree   mit s knittel said in a statement   the mckinsey curve would suggest the fruit s already on the ground  if this is true  we want to figure out why no one is picking it up  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some of the other issues the project will evaluate are whether consumers and businesses are bypassing profitable opportunities to reduce their energy consumption and how best to encourage individuals and businesses to invest in energy efficiency  already  the team is tracking consumers  vehicle purchasing decisions to discover whether better information about cars  fuel economy leads to the purchase of more fuel efficient vehicles </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the e e project features an advisory board made up of several prominent figures focused on energy  including former u s  secretary of state george p  shultz  who leads the energy policy task force at stanford university s hoover institution  mit institute professor john deutch  former undersecretary of the department of energy  and cass sunstein  a professor at harvard law school and president obama s former director of regulatory affairs</paragraph>
    <paragraph> i like the saying  a penny saved is a penny earned   which rings true from the standpoint of energy   shultz said in a statement   energy that is used efficiently not only reduces costs  but is also the cleanest energy around  the e e project will allow us to better understand which energy efficiency programs save the most pennies  </paragraph>

  <title>dartmouth s tuck school of business confers first mba mph joint degrees</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>two members of the graduating class of      at dartmouth college s tuck school of business earned not only an mba while there but also a master s degree in public health  mph   kate head and catherine augustyn were the first recipients of the new joint degree  which tuck now offers in partnership with the dartmouth institute for health policy and clinical practice  tdi   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new program is designed for students who want to combine tuck s comprehensive mba program with tdi s deep dive into health policy and clinical practice issues   the combination of those two programs we thought would be a really terrific marriage   paul b  gardent  an adjunct professor of business administration at tuck and director of the joint degree program  said as part of an article published in tuck s online newsroom  the joint degree program is an outgrowth of the health care initiative  an effort launched in      to expand healthcare focused courses and career resources at tuck  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>head and augustyn were drawn to the mba mph joint degree because it offered them an opportunity to develop and implement the tools of management education to address the challenges and complexity of healthcare  now  they will both apply the skills they have gained in leadership positions in this highly specialized field  head joins the chartis group  a consulting firm serving medical centers  and augustyn will go to work as a project manager under the chief financial officer at massachusetts eye and ear  an affiliate hospital of harvard medical school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the joint degree program integrates tdi s one year     credit  full time mph degree program into tuck s two year mba program  completing three years of education in two years  time is challenging but manageable  according to the first two joint degree graduates   you lose some of the travel opportunities in the mba to do the mph coursework  and you sacrifice a little relaxation time in your second year  but i think it s worth it   head said in tuck article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gardent sang the praises of the program s inaugural students   if our first two graduates are any indication  our mba mph joint degree students are going to really enrich both the tuck and tdi student bodies  and we know these graduates will play a leadership role in improving health care   he said </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s graham richmond weighs in on harvard business school application changes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the business education media has been abuzz following the announcement yesterday that harvard business school  hbs  will change its application requirements in the year ahead  bloomberg businessweek  poetsandquants  the financial times and others all featured articles conveying the news and reactions to it  both bloomberg bw and p q consulted clear admit co founder graham richmond to get his take on what the changes mean  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most notable  richmond says  is hbs s decision to make the essay an optional portion of the application  which sets it apart from virtually every other top mba program   i cannot think of any that have zero required essays   he told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  hbs dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold did share yesterday that hbs may admit candidates who do not submit an essay  because they feel the rest of the file speaks for itself   richmond doesn t think very many candidates will fall into that category though </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my suspicion is that the vast majority of qualified hbs applicants will feel that they have more to offer than transcripts  data forms  test scores and recommendation letters and will therefore make use of the optional essay to further describe their personal background  leadership profile  professional aspirations and desire to join contribute to the hbs community   he told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the fact that there is no word limit on responses to the new essay question means that applicants can use the space to convey whatever message they think may not otherwise be represented in their application  richmond told p q   that said  given that hbs is describing the evolution of their essays as one that streamlines the overall application by reducing word count  and avoiding an essay writing contest   one could reasonably interpret the school as looking for something less than last year s     total word count   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as for hbs s other changes to the application process   reducing the number of required recommendations from three to two and moving the application deadline up by    days or so   these are not as significant  richmond says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>requiring just two recommendations simply puts hbs in line with the vast majority of other leading mba programs  making it easier for applicants who are considering other programs to also apply to hbs  as always  hbs requires that the recommendations come from current or former direct supervisors or from someone the applicant worked closely with at an extracurricular organization  the goal  richmond told bloomberg bw  should be to select recommenders who  are in a position to judge the candidate s managerial skills  leadership qualities  emotional intelligence and intellectual firepower  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>likewise  moving the deadline up from september   th to september   th isn t a major change in richmond s view   this generation of applicants  the  millennials   has been anxious to start the process earlier and earlier each year   and we see that first hand at clear admit  where we have had a high volume of inquiries in months  like march  april and may  that used to be fairly quiet historically   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bottom line  richmond believes that essays can add value to a candidate s profile and that using hbs s  optional  essay will give applicants a way to differentiate themselves   not every applicant who will excel in business school is going to ace the interview process or have the absolute best letters or recommendation  gpa or gmat score   but many applicants have incredible experiences to share that don t fit into the confines of the application forms and really lend themselves to the prose format of an essay   he says </paragraph>

  <title>yale som admissions director updates clear admit on video interviews  other application elements</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the yale school of management  som  will formally incorporate a brief video interview as part of its application process in upcoming admission seasons  assistant dean and director of mba admissions bruce delmonico shared with the clear admit team recently  he also provided more detail about the tests yale som has been using to assess the emotional intelligence of its applicants and shared that his team will eliminate the english language test requirement that has until now been required of some applicants  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some round   applicants to yale som in the most recent application season reported that they were asked to respond to an interview question via video  in an effort to learn more about this development  we reached out to delmonico directly  who shared the following details with us  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>yale som piloted the video question format two years ago  in       and then put it on hold last year  re introducing it as part of round   this year  he said  the school plans to incorporate video questions fully into the application process going forward  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the motivation behind them is that the ability to think and speak in the moment is an important skill but one that is measured inconsistently in the current application process  so we are looking for a mechanism that will help us evaluate these qualities more consistently and effectively   he told us   we believe that video questions are a step in this direction  but by no means the end point  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>delmonico also elaborated on the mayer salovey caruso emotional intelligence test  msceit   which yale som asked applicants to take on a voluntary basis as part of the most recent application season  according to an article last month in the wall street journal  unrelated to the video questions  the     item msceit is one of a range of non cognitive assessments his team has been evaluating  delmonico told us   we ve been looking at a number of different assessments over the last   to   years and feel as though we re starting to get a feel for what may be worth folding into the process   he said  but so far  no such test has affected admissions decisions </paragraph>
    <paragraph> one other thing you may be interested to know is that we will eliminate the english language test requirement  toefl  ielts  pte  etc   this upcoming application season   he shared  until now  yale som has required this test for applicants whose undergraduate degree was from a program not taught in english  but future applicants will not face that requirement  delmonico said </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school reduces number of application essays  recommendations</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>prospective applicants to harvard business school  hbs   take note  dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold shared a lot of interesting information in her director s blog today  topline news  applicants for fall      will only answer one essay  with no word limit  and will only need to submit two letters of recommendation  down from three  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the single essay question asks simply what else the ad com should consider about an applicant s candidacy in addition to the other elements submitted as part of the application  resume  school transcripts  extra curricular activities  awards  post mba career goals  test scores   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that s it  no word limit  use your own judgment as to how much to tell us   wrote leopold   we have neither a  right answer  nor a  correct length  in mind   she added  noting that her team will review all elements of the written application before inviting some candidates to advance to the interview stage </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some applicants may even choose not to submit an essay if they feel the other elements of the application tell their story completely  leopold offered  repeating something she said last year when hbs first reduced its number of essays  leopold explained that hbs has further reduced the number of essays because applying to business school is  not an essay writing contest    there is always  and will always be   great variance in both subject matter and degree of polish in the essays of admitted candidates   she wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to the rationale behind requiring fewer letters of recommendation  leopold said she hopes it will remove a hurdle for prospective applicants  who come from organizations where there is not a tried and true path for talented folks to leave for business school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>looking into her crystal ball  leopold predicted that roughly       candidates will advance to the interview stage of the selection process  on par with the last several years  her team will admit roughly       of those who interview  to result in a final class of     or so matriculating students  and the post interview reflection   an invitation to applicants to send a brief follow up email within    hours of interviewing   will be part of the application process again this year   we liked it   leopold shared </paragraph>

  <title>umichigan s ross school of business revises essay portion of application</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a post yesterday to the ross admissions blog  director of admissions soojin kwon shared the school s planned changes to the essay portion of the application and the rationale behind them  applicants for fall      will find that one of the essays from last year has been adjusted  one has been eliminated and the others have remained the same  they will also find that they have     words fewer overall with which to answer the essays </paragraph>
    <paragraph> before we jump into the next admissions cycle  our team takes some time to reflect on how our application process worked for the past year and where we can make improvements   kwon wrote  noting that the process includes gathering feedback from application readers  student and alumni interviewers and even admitted students who decide to enroll elsewhere  kwon s team also confers with colleagues in career services  academic services and the mba program itself to make sure the application is designed to best identify potential star students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>revisions to the essay questions mean that ross will no longer ask prospective applicants to share what they are most passionate about   we enjoyed reading those essays  but unfortunately the responses just didn t help us to differentiate candidates very well   kwon explained </paragraph>
    <paragraph>two questions from last year remain the same  one that asks applicants to describe themselves to their future ross classmates and another that asks them to share a time in their career when they were frustrated or disappointed </paragraph>
    <paragraph>perhaps the biggest change is a new three part question in which applicants will have     words each to answer why business school  why ross and what career they plan to pursue after business school and why   essay   is thematically similar to last year s essay  but we broke it up into three parts with the hope that it ll help applicants be more focused in their responses   kwon noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  applicants will still have an optional essay where they can discuss anything they haven t shared elsewhere in the application  but in lieu of     words  they will now be limited to     words for this purpose </paragraph>
    <paragraph> overall  our total maximum word count has been reduced by     words  and hopefully you ll be able to use that found time to craft the most compelling essays possible   kwon concluded </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in shortening the essay portion of the application  ross joins a growing list of top schools that have revised their applications to include fewer essays overall and limit responses to fewer words  others include mit sloan school of management  harvard business school  stanford graduate school of business  uc berkeley s haas school and spain s iese  just to name a few </paragraph>

    <paragraph>since the debut issue late last year  mba intelligence has published monthly  with each new issue tackling a different theme  may s issue was a gmat special edition  with articles from gmat test prep firms manhattan elite prep and kaplan test prep filled with tips and techniques for prospective mba applicants on how to ace the all important business school entrance exam </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other articles in the may issue were written by current students from cass business school in london  in one  a group of executive mba students set out to define a strategy for market share growth for online grocer ocado  putting into practice precisely the skills and expertise they are developing as part of their strategy course at cass  a second article  written by a full time      mba candidate at cass  takes a deep dive into luxury brand marketing strategies  providing a thoughtful analysis of aston martin  the luxury car brand  which is now celebrating its centennial year  topics here include aston martin s successes and challenges as they relate to connecting with the customer  brand building  delivering value and creating long term growth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if you re wondering whether the new publication is worth its       online newsstand price  you can decide for yourself by perusing mba intelligence s debut issue  available for free here  as you ll see in the december issue  cass mbas figured prominently again  as they did in the most recent may      issue  here  student articles touched on topics ranging from the importance of business strategy during market entry and early growth to an analysis of how luxury brand jimmy choo has taken an integrated marketing approach   relying on social media  celebrity endorsements and product placement  along with more traditional print and in store marketing   to maximize brand recognition </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  we found the publication interesting and well crafted  for prospective applicants  we think it s worth a gander both for the content specifically linked to the application process as well as for the preview the magazine provides of exactly the kind of work students can expect to encounter once they enroll in an mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we ll look forward in future issues to seeing articles from mba students representing a wider range of programs both in the united kingdom and beyond  we also hope the publication will eventually be delivered on devices in addition to the ipad  even until then  at       an issue  it seems like a bargain  but take note  your subscription will automatically renew unless auto renew is turned off within a designated time period  so read the fine print </paragraph>

    <paragraph>yossi feinberg  a stanford economics professor and the stanford ignite faculty professor  told the ft that the program is designed for professionals in their fields who lack managerial experience   it s remarkable how much innovation there is and how much is lost through the lack of business skills   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford ignite will target people who are interested in innovation  either in a start up or within their own company  and help provide them with the tools they need to create a successful venture  it will reflect the curriculum of a traditional mba  but with a focus on the topics most useful to entrepreneurs   it s accounting for entrepreneurs  it s finance for entrepreneurs   they will not go to wall street   feinberg told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the india program  scheduled to being in august  will be taught on the infosys campus in bangalore  the france program will be part of a collaboration between stanford and france s premier science university  ecole polytechnique  stanford professors will fly to each india and france as part of the ignite program  but much of the teaching will be done remotely  according to the ft  the nine week program will cost approximately          the ft adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the success of the california program has been assessed by the number of successful ventures it has helped create  and the india and france ignite programs will be judged by the same measure  feinberg told the ft </paragraph>

    <paragraph>in the midst of leading one of the top mba programs in the world  dean peter blair henry of new york university  nyu  stern school of business somehow also finds time both to publish and to unwind with students </paragraph>

  <title>interest in social entrepreneurship rises among mbas  creating some challenges for business schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as interest in social entrepreneurship has swelled among mba students in recent years  top business schools have responded by developing new programs  centers and scholarships for students pursuing a field that was relatively unheard of a few decades ago  but as the financial times reported in a recent article  the trend toward social entrepreneurship  as well as shifts in the structure of organizations social entrepreneurs seek to join upon graduation  presents a new set of challenges for top mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in the     s there was almost no talk at all in business schools about anything that we might now call social entrepreneurship   peter tufano  dean of said business school at the university of oxford  told the ft   i think we ve seen an explosive growth in demand for social entrepreneurship in the last    years   he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in response  said opened the skoll centre for social entrepreneurship       which recently hosted it   th world forum on social entrepreneurship  said students who demonstrate exceptional social entrepreneurial ability can apply for skoll scholarships as part of a program created in       and interest in these scholarships has tripled since that time  according to skoll centre director pamela hartigan  last year      students of said s cohort of     applied for the scholarships  and early indications suggest this year will be as high if not higher  even as criteria for gaining the scholarships has become more stringent   we have moved from candidates who had experience in development organizations to looking at those who have undertaken social entrepreneurial venture creation in a serious way   hartigan told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the stanford graduate school of business has likewise seen interest in social entrepreneurship balloon  according to the ft report  in          mba students graduated with a certificate in public management and social innovation  an add on to the mba   up from    in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at said  stanford and elsewhere  graduates focused on social entrepreneurship are moving away from nonprofit organizations and looking more to join for profit organizations committed to delivering social good </paragraph>
    <paragraph> more and more of our students are interested in setting up for profit rather than non profit social enterprises  this is definitely a trend   bernadette clavier  stanford gsb director of public management and social innovation programs  told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the converging trends of more students pursuing social entrepreneurship and more of those students leaning toward for profit organizations within which to work has created some new challenges for business schools  the ft reports  in the united states  for example  many schools offer scholarships or loan forgiveness programs to students who enter non profit organizations  but that assistance is not available to graduates who enter for profit organizations focused on social impact  despite the low salaries they will most likely receive </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are looking to find ways to extend our loan forgiveness and fellowship programs to social enterprises   clavier told the ft   the challenge is to identify a proper source of funding to support students who choose this for profit route   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business schools who encourage their students to pursue social entrepreneurship also stand to suffer in the annual rankings of mba programs that so many watch so closely   i do think that a business school that encourages social entrepreneurs is quite brave because mba ranking tables do take into account the salaries of mba graduates and typical salaries in social entrepreneurship tend to be lower   tim jones  an associate fellow at said and a newly appointed entrepreneur in residence at judge business school at the university of cambridge  told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph> rankings tables are the bane of my existence   concurred said s hartigan   how do we shift that idea about the importance of a high salary  if we re really going to sustain ourselves in the next millennium we need sustainable models  schools that emphasize social entrepreneurship should not be penalized   she added </paragraph>

  <title>northwestern s kellogg school of management sees application volume rebound</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>after a   percent drop in applications to its two year  full time mba program last year  northwestern s kellogg school of management saw double digit application volume increases this year to all of its mba programs  according to a recent article in poets quants  interest in the school s one year mba program for undergraduate business majors was especially great  with    percent more applicants this year over last  kellogg dean sally blount told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>blount bragged about the school s waitlist  calling it  awfully beautiful  and noting that it is filled with candidates with gmat scores of     and higher  she credited the school s new senior leadership team   as well as its strategy to build enrollment in its one year program while shrinking its traditional two year program   for the application volume growth  kellogg last year increased the size of its one year program by    percent  to     students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>since joining kellogg from new york university three years ago  blount has been leading an effort to rebalance the school s degree portfolio   it is not about growth  it is how do we meet the need for the marketplace for the best students in the world  it s all about building the best class of graduates   she told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business degrees make up    percent of all undergraduate degrees granted in the united states in the past    years  and people in their   s feel like they have less time  blount told p q  these factors taken together underscored the potential appeal of the one year program   we are the only top tier school that has been in that market with this program   blount said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to increasing its one year enrollment and shrinking its two year program  kellogg has also launched an accelerated part time program at its downtown chicago building for students with undergraduate business degrees  and in august it will pilot a new one year ms in management studies for northwestern undergraduates without a business background   it s the equivalent of an undergraduate business and the first year of the mba degree   blount told p q  adding that the inaugural class will have    students  eventually  blount hopes to enroll between     and     students in the new program each year  although she did not disclose when the program will expand to include students from outside northwestern </paragraph>

  <title>tepper school of business flexmba online offering draws interest from prospective applicants nationwide</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>carnegie mellon university  cmu  s tepper school of business will debut a new online mba offering next fall  and prospective applicants from across the united states   as well as europe and asia   have shown interest and or submitted applications  the school reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>flexmba   a new online mba offering that will offer the same curriculum  faculty and access to services to online students that they would receive on campus as part of the traditional mba program   differs from the mooc  massive open online courses  model by creating small class sections of roughly    students and maximizing interaction between students and faculty  tepper notes  students will take part in weekly live online classes with tepper professors and attend approximately five  access weekends  each year in which all flexmba students will travel to a cmu campus for intense classwork and professional development programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the appeal of flexmba is that now professionals in any geographic region can pursue a top level mba education without relocating  which may otherwise be prohibited by their current job or family situation   kelly r  wilson  tepper executive director of admissions  said in a statement  wilson noted that tepper so far has received applications or expressions of interest from prospective students in    states as well as europe and asia  the inaugural program will feature a synchronous online class component based on u s  time zones and will meet at locations in north america  reducing somewhat the feasibility of participation by students outside the u s   though any student who can meet the application requirements  access the online coursework  and travel to the periodic class meetings is eligible  wilson added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to online coursework and weekly interactions with professors  flexmba students also will have access to alumni and student services  including coaches from the school s accelerate leadership center and advisors from the career opportunity center </paragraph>
    <paragraph> face time and personalization are critical components of business education   robert monroe  associate teaching professor and director of the flexmba program  said in a statement   we will utilize technology to deliver appropriate components of the curriculum and will engage our access weekends to spur group learning and interaction   he continued  far from being just another mooc offering  flexmba is designed to deliver the same high level student experience as tepper s traditional full time mba  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tepper will host two upcoming online information sessions and application workshops  one on wednesday  may  th  from   to   p m   and another on wednesday  may   th  from    to   p m  these sessions are open to the public </paragraph>
    <paragraph>application requirements for the tepper flexmba are identical to those for the full and part time mba program  applications for flexmba will be accepted through june  rd </paragraph>

  <title>     wharton business plan competition winners announced  previous participants and competition organizers share their thoughts on the competition s value to wharton students and future entrepreneurs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the inspirations and motivations of those pursuing places in top mba programs are many  for some  the goal is to further careers in existing business institutions by gaining additional knowledge and skills that will propel their professional paths to the highest echelons of management  for others  the main goal is to develop the insights and relationships necessary to create their own ventures  and to foster the growth and success of said ventures once they have completed their mba studies  there are many other circumstances that might spark the passion for a b school education  but this afternoon and evening the latter entrepreneurial mindset was on full display during the final wharton business plan competition  wbpc  event </paragraph>
    <paragraph>held in the auditorium of jon m  huntsman hall  the day began with the eight finalists providing ten minute presentations followed by ten minutes of questions and answers with a panel of expert judges  this group included david a  cohen  ceo and co founder of karlin asset management  inc   maxine gowen  president and ceo of trevena inc   richard perlman  founder and executive chairman of examworks group inc   and rich riley  former executive vice president  americas  of yahoo  inc  among the  great eight  were wharton mba and emba students  as well as members of upenn s larger student population  including one freshman  two seniors  and multiple penn medical school students  business ideas ranged from online solutions to buying childcare products in southeast asia to a new  non invasive method of treating rheumatoid arthritis  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to get to venture finals and present their respective business plans in front of the judges  panel  the teams went through four competition stages  while similar business plan competitions are held over the course of just a few days  this was the culmination of eight months of hard work  in fact  clear admit checked in with past winners of the competition  an early round judge  and the leader of wharton s overall entrepreneurship program to learn more about the wbpc s structure and impact  many of those interviewed commented on how wharton s longer format provides participants with the opportunity for educational reality checks and feedback from a wide range of judges and competition contributors  even for those who don t make it to the finals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>emily cieri  current managing director of the wharton entrepreneurship program  described the opening round as being a safe environment for all penn students to begin exploring their entrepreneurial ideas   the beginning stage is really open to the whole university  any student can participate  there are no barriers to entry  in that first phase students can submit multiple ideas and get feedback on all of them  the lack of barriers allows us to capture a pretty large and diverse range of ideas and participants   this first optional  advisory  stage allows interested parties to begin the process of fine tuning their idea in preparation for the first competitive round of the wbpc  davis smith      whose business baby com br came in third in the      wbpc and tied for first in harvard s new venture competition  contrasted the two competitions   i was blown away by wharton s competition   he said   it wasn t just a week long thing  it was a year long event  there were multiple levels of feedback  which included a lot of mentoring and coaching  and events to help people refine or think of ideas  connect with mentors  and develop the skills to write a business plan in a clear concise way  while at hbs  it was basically just show up  also wharton s structure led to more teams competing  i think over         teams submitted ideas to wharton the year i competed  at hbs the total was more like     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>over     individuals volunteer as judges for the competition s multiple rounds  providing the opportunity for students to access a wide range of industry expertise and experience   rohan deuskar  a winning team member of the      competition praised the value the competition s incremental stages had for his business  stylitics  as well as the opportunities it created to interact with a wide variety of industry insiders throughout the judging process  the progressive stages  forced us to be structured in our thinking and to begin anticipating the questions we would get from potential investors   deuskar said   the competition was a safe forum for us to receive feedback on the quality of our initial answers   participating in the competition also exposed the stylitics concept to a number of judges who thought the idea had potential  and whose connections to other relevant industry leaders directly led to initial funding and investments for deuskar and his team </paragraph>
    <paragraph>former contestants had differing views on what stage of the process was the most challenging for them  some said that while the final round had its own intensity  it was the second to last round that caused them the most anxiety  eric heil  whose business  rightcare solutions  won the      wbpc  focused on the time limits of the third phase of the competition and how they influenced his team s pitch approach   getting our idea and presentation to a point where it was succinct and relatable in five minutes or less was a challenge  but having the opportunity to take the time to distill and articulate our vision was a good challenge to go through   davis smith agreed  explaining that the second to the last round stuck out as the most challenging for him and his team   there were a good number of judges on the panel  a lot more judges than in the final round  and about    teams competing for   spots  judges were pretty aggressive in their questioning  they weren t afraid to make you look bad  in the final round  in front of a more diverse audience  judges were nicer  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>natasha and chris ashton  competition winners in      for their pet insurance business petplan  elaborated on the importance of communication while saying that the finals were the stage that caused them the most anxiety   each stage was challenging in their own rights but for us the final stage was most challenging  at that point it s not just a great business plan or idea  it s the ability to communicate it to your audience  you must be a great presenter and orator  we weren t the head of the pack in the final round  when we began we were fourth or fifth in the scores  but we managed to put in a stellar presentation  which ultimately landed us the prize  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>david mars      who has been a judge in the first three stages of the competition over the last few years  echoed the importance of clarity when asked what strategies or elements of a business idea impressed or intrigued him the most as a judge  successful teams  get your attention right away and get you to buy the basic idea from the start  then you listen to the rest of the plan  they have five minutes to really get their purpose across  if you have to listen to the whole five minutes before figuring out what they re doing  that puts the team at a disadvantage   mars also suggested that as much as the idea itself must be compelling  team dynamics are equally important  in his assessment he looks  at the team first and the idea second   it s not just one person  how does the main founder bring in others to create a well balanced approach across the competition  operations  finance  marketing  as a founder you can t always do everything  how good have team leaders been at convincing real quality people to join them  at an early stage like this  a ceo or co founder s entire job is selling  selling to their team  selling to investors   and ultimately selling to their potential customers   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit asked previous winners and finalists what words of wisdom or advice they would give to the newest round of finalists   their responses were both inspirational and pragmatic  natasha and chris ashton s advice for finalists was short and to the point   hope is not a plan  just do it   while davis smith reflected that he wished he had gotten to know his competitors better   we re all competitive by nature  especially at wharton  forget about the competition if you can  and get to know them  at the end of the day this is both an opportunity to build your network and enjoy the experience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at some point  similar advice was surely offered to this year s winning team  zenkars  as well as all teams that competed  zenkars winning business idea was focused on a new way to sell used cars directly to consumers via the internet  in their presentation they stressed that their approach would allow consumers to have a more peaceful buying experience while still allowing their business to remain profitable  when asked questions by the judges about how they would compare or differentiate themselves from similar online companies  they were ready to back up their plans with additional nuances as well as financial projections and details </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while the judges deliberated  all eight competitors were also given the chance to present one minute elevator pitches to a larger audience for the michelson people s choice awards  all audience members were permitted to cast their votes for the team they felt came up with the most engaging and convincing summary of their plan  teams all stuck to their allotted time limits and employed a variety of techniques to capture the attention of the audience  which was simultaneously helping itself to a complimentary buffet of chicken</paragraph>
    <paragraph>kabobs  phyllo wrapped asparagus  tempura shrimp and oozing baked brie  zenkars stood out with their humorous sketch in which the team leader jean mathieu chabas     and team member venkat jonnala     acted out a scenario wherein chabas sought to purchase a used car but wasn t sure where to start  venkat then appeared and persuaded chabas that zenkars would be the best choice  this was made more humorous by chabas  choice of dress   informal athletic gear instead of the suit and tie he wore during their formal presentation   as well as an american accent  chabas  contributions to their main presentation would suggest that he is a francophone   they concluded their pitch by joking that all wharton students would receive a      discount for any car they purchased through the site </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during the lull that occurred while people s choice ballots were being tallied and judges continued to determine their picks for the competition s overall winners  the crowd gathered at the base of the steps in huntsman hall s forum in anticipation  student organizers  as well as wharton entrepreneurship program organizers emily cieri and jill anick  extended gratitude to the numerous individuals who helped plan and organize the event  from all the judges and advisors to the underwriters of top prizes  eventually the crowd hushed as the two co chairs and hosts of the event  fraz ahmed     and lane rettig      took to the stage to announce the winners  they began with the gloeckner award  a         prize given to the highest ranking wharton undergraduate team that competed in the wbpc  this honor went to alphax  which developed a  early stage anti inflammatory small molecule drug  that would allow those suffering rheumatoid arthritis to avoid painful and repetitive drug injections in favor of an oral alternative  next  the people s choice awards were announced  while zenkars may have gotten the loudest laughs  it was maculens that prevailed   the maculens team  comprised of two wharton mba students   one of whom was pursuing a dual mba md degree   hopes to bring a new product to market that will reduce the risks and hassles of the glare of headlights and other bright lights that one often experiences when driving  the product itself could be applied to drivers  glasses  car windows and many other surfaces  and could also be potentially beneficial to professional athletes competing at night </paragraph>
    <paragraph>then it was on to the top three overall winners  coming in third was top trender  a company focused on spotting fashion trends and helping buyers of department stores and clothing companies determine the styles that would be most likely to hit big in upcoming seasons through an online game  the second place winner was maculens  and for the perlman grand prize of          it was zenkars for the win </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the day long event concluded with the cheers of friends and contestants  and the smiling and relieved expressions of the winners as they were mobbed by well wishers and asked to pose for numerous photographs  while there could be only one winner  all contestants benefited from the exposure and guidance the wbpc provided  and there is little doubt that even those outside of the top three have bright futures ahead of them </paragraph>

  <title>alternative lenders could offer new options for foreign students at u s  business schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>private student lending shrank sharply during the financial crisis  and though traditional lenders have cautiously returned to making loans to u s  citizens  non americans looking to attend business school in the united states often are hard pressed to find financing options that don t require a u s  co signer  but according to a recent article in the financial times  peer to peer lenders and crowdfunding start ups could present new opportunities for foreign students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one peer to peer lender  sofi  which hopes to lend    billion this year  has been in discussions with several u s  business schools about extending loans to foreign students that would be funded by alumni from their home country  the ft reports  meanwhile  pave  a crowdfunding start up that lets students raise money from backers in exchange for a share of future income  is also considering expanding to other countries  the ft adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most existing loan programs for overseas students are funded by banks or credit unions but guaranteed by business schools themselves  which leaves schools exposed to the risk of default and has made some schools reluctant to lend to foreign students  columbia business school  for example  will only lend to foreign students who have a u s  co signer  directing other students to seek scholarships and loans from institutions in their home countries </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the default rate is higher for international students   mark kantrowitz  publisher of student finance website finaid org  told the ft   it is very difficult for any lender to collect from someone who s overseas  in the u s  you could sue and get their wages garnished  deducted   but you can t do that overseas  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>alternative lenders like sofi and pave rely on social components to address default risk  sofi  for its part  exerts social pressure on borrowers who feel an affinity with alumni investors  mike cagney  sofi chief executive  told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>pave and other crowdsourcing start ups  meanwhile  tie payments to the borrower s own financial success  giving investors cause to mentor borrowers and help with networking and job referrals   i have an incentive to help him succeed   explains pave co founder sal lahoud about a potential borrower  if a borrower does well  the backing investor receives the initial investment and more  but borrowers don t have to repay during years when their income falls below a certain level </paragraph>

  <title>current chicago booth student touts value of mba for entrepreneurs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an mba student at the university of chicago booth school of business this week shared her perspective in forbes on why an mba makes sense for entrepreneurs  stella fayman  who is concurrently launching a startup while pursuing an mba at booth  wrote in part in response to an op ed earlier this week in the wall street journal advising startups not to hire mbas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rattling off    successful companies all started by mbas from top business schools   angie s list  grubhub  warby parker and yelp  just to name a few   fayman offers three main arguments in favor of the mba  they attract top talent  they can be a  sandbox  for starting a company and they provide structured support </paragraph>
    <paragraph> mba programs are intensely competitive  with top    programs having an acceptance rate of less than    percent   fayman writes   this means that by taking part in a program  you ll be exposed to people with experiences that will blow your mind   these classmates will become your future network and may even include future business partners  she notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>surrounded by these smart  ambitious people  in an environment where you can recruit for a job in the event that your idea doesn t pan out  and with the structured mentorship and access to resources that many top schools provide through entrepreneurship centers   that s business school  fayman writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the decision  for an entrepreneur  of whether or not to go the mba route is personal and should depend on your own experiences and goals  fayman acknowledges   so the best first step is to talk to people who you admire on both sides of the fence  analyze the alternatives and look at your long term goals   she advises </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>insead  with campuses in france and singapore  boasted a global mba program well before many other top business schools began to establish satellites for their programs in regions around the world  having now added a new abu dhabi module to its core mba program  insead is expanding its international reach even farther </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the abu dhabi location got its start as a research center in      and grew into a full fledged campus in       offering executive education and executive mba programs  as part of the new module rolled out this year  students can now spend a week in january  a week in february and a concluding weekend in march as part of the core mba program  enjoying lectures  guest speakers  field trips to and group projects with local companies  alumni networking and visits to recruiters  </paragraph>

  <title>university of chicago booth school of business dean reminds mba students the internship isn t everything</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>sunil kumar  dean of the university of chicago booth school of business  is quick to remind his students not to shortchange their actual academic experience during the first year of their mba program in furious pursuit of a summer internship  according to a recent economist article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>acknowledging that competition is fierce and that successful internships are among the most important stepping stones to securing a job upon graduation  they are still just a  low cost experiment  for firms and students to feel the other out  kumar told the economist   the truth is that a lot of people don t stay in their first job very long but go on to have great careers   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dean kumar also encouraged mba students to consider taking an entrepreneurship course as an academic subject even if they don t have any intention of becoming an entrepreneur   it provides an academic capstone experience   he told the economist   the basic conceit of being an entrepreneur having an idea and moving that idea forward is useful whether you work for yourself or within a company  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>technology does and will continue to play an important role in business education  kumar said  noting that chicago booth has established a studio on its main campus in chicago to enable professors to reach students on the school s other campuses in london and singapore  the school has also created a way to connect mba students on its various campuses with others who share similar entrepreneurial ideas   using algorithms like those used by dating websites like match com </paragraph>

    <paragraph>richmond s comments appeared in a bloomberg businessweek article entitled   how to stand out in an mba group interview   the university of michigan s ross school of business is the latest top mba program to require applicants to work as a group as part of the application process  joining switzerland s imd and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  bloomberg bw notes  though the schools are taking this step in an effort to elicit more off the cuff responses from applicants  there are still ways to prepare for these new exercises </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit s richmond advises learning as much as you can about the format of the group exercise and what a particular school is trying to test through it  in addition to trying to get unscripted responses from applicants  the schools are also using team interviews to evaluate how well applicants listen  their overall communication skills  the level of intellectual curiosity they possess and  of course  how they work as part of a group  richmond told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for more tips from richmond  as well as from admissions directors at some of the schools incorporating group interviews  check out the complete bloomberg bw post </paragraph>

    <paragraph>but clear admit provides applicants with much more than just a dress rehearsal for the group interview  ingram notes   i really view my job as akin to being a guidance counselor   he told the dp   it s really helpful for students in their twenties to put a lot of deep thought into what their career goals are  what do you want to do when you grow up  why mba  we help people think through those questions  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>as reported here in january  the ross school of business at the university of michigan plans to officially launch team based interviews as part of its mba admissions process in       following wharton s lead  an article this week in bloomberg businessweek sheds some light on the approach ross is taking  as evidenced through pilot efforts the admissions team conducted with roughly     applicants in beijing  shanghai and ann arbor this past admissions season </paragraph>
    <paragraph>like wharton  ross is seeking to assess how applicants interact with one another through the new team based exercises  the format the michigan school is using  however  differs from wharton s  in which candidates are sent a question in advance and then grouped with other applicants to present a team solution  at ross  the pilot exercises held in january and february involved applicants first approaching a task individually and then as a group  according to the bloomberg bw report  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ross applicants   in groups of four to six   were first given    minutes to prepare individual presentations connecting two random words in any way they chose  next  the group was given a set of random words and    minutes to use the words to address a problem and solution as a team </paragraph>
    <paragraph> different things come out in a group interview   soojin kwon  ross director of admissions  told bloomberg bw   it creates a more complete picture of what the applicant will be like in a classroom and in our community   random words were used to prevent applicants from preparing in advance  kwon added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to test the new format  some of the applicants invited for the traditional one on one interview were encouraged to participate in the group exercise  though their performance would not be part of their application evaluation  the ross admission committee told them  kwon told bloomberg bw that she hopes to implement the team based interview more broadly next year  but that the logistics of how to bring together interviewees and evaluators may make it hard to use with all applicants  evaluators for the pilot group interviews at ross were alumni and second year students </paragraph>

  <title>spain s esade plans to expand focus on africa</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>esade business school in spain plans to expand its focus on africa  both as a place to do business and as a place from which to attract more prospective business school students  as part of this effort  the barcelona school hosted a panel discussion earlier this week to inspire current students to consider work in africa  the financial times reported </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the number one goal of this event was to open students  minds to the opportunities in africa   katie carr  who is esade s regional director for europe  the middle east  africa and india  told the ft  carr was appointed to the role six months ago and immediately decided to analyze the school s connections to each of the regional areas she oversees  among her discoveries  more prospective applicants took the graduate management admission test  gmat  in nigeria than in spain  and yet students from the entire continent make up only   to   percent of esade s incoming classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more of carr s analysis uncovered the fact that very few esade students consider the african continent as a possible region for future job opportunities  according to the ft  and so the idea for monday s panel event was born  the event consisted of five panelists sharing experiences about their work in africa and the opportunities they see there for graduating business school students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the panelists  shaun gause  decided to form a trade development and consulting firm in sierra leone after completing the georgetown esade global emba two years ago  gause had previously been involved in charitable healthcare activities targeting africa  but they left him feeling frustrated </paragraph>
    <paragraph> my previous work in africa involved me chasing after money and equipment  while it made an impact  it only lasted as long as the money was there  then you had to go and get more money   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  as chief executive and co founder of global group inc  ggi   gause invests the money of wealthy individuals in projects chosen by ggi on a not for profit basis  with their principal protected  investors can choose to share in any profit a project makes  but profit is not their main aim  the ft reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gause acknowledges that there is a lack of appetite  particularly coming from the west  for africa as a business destination  but he underscores the rewards he thinks can be found there   you can go there and learn not just how to survive  but how to thrive   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph> they say necessity is the mother of invention  if you take the lessons you learned in africa and apply them in the us and europe you might find you learned more than you expected   he adds </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school  stanford share number one spot again in u s  news   world report rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>u s  news   world report released its annual ranking of business schools yesterday  revealing little change at the very top from last year  harvard business school and stanford graduate school of business tied for first  and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school came in third again </paragraph>
    <paragraph>massachusetts institute of technology s sloan school of management and northwestern university s kellogg school of management tied for number four  last year  the university of chicago s booth school of business shared in a three way tie for that spot  but this year it slipped down to sixth  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rounding out the top ten were uc berkeley s haas school of management      columbia business school      dartmouth s tuck school of business     and new york university s stern school of business      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the u s  news rankings are based on a weighted average of several indicators  including overall program quality  peer assessments  recruiter assessments  placement success  mean starting salary and bonus  average gmat score and gpa and more  to compile this year s rankings  all     master s programs accredited by aacsb international were surveyed in fall      and early           of which responded </paragraph>
    <paragraph>notably  yale school of management  som   which ranked tenth last year  fell to number     something of a surprise to some in the mba community who have been closely watching the significant changes new dean ed snyder  formerly dean of both darden and booth  has been making at the school since taking over two years ago  but a closer look at the indexed scores u s  news uses to compile the rankings shows that yale s stayed steady at     the same as it was last year  instead  it was increases in scores for nyu stern       duke s fuqua school of business      and uva s darden school of business      that resulted in yale som s slip in the overall lineup </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as always  those of us at clear admit encourage prospective applicants to use rankings as just one component in a thorough investigation of schools and programs when trying to assess where to apply </paragraph>

    <paragraph>the exhibit   building the foundation  business education for women at harvard university              reveals the many ways in which women were a part of hbs long before the      hbs faculty vote that led to women s admission directly into the first year of the mba program  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  as the exhibit showcases  women first began studying business at harvard university in       as part of the training course in personnel administration at radcliffe college  later known as the harvard radcliffe program in business administration   a certificate program  hbs professor fritz roethlisberger called it  the first daring experiment in  practical education  for women    an opening that would lead  albeit    years later  to the first eight female students enrolled in the      hbs two year mba program  alongside     men  by       women were fully integrated into the program  the school adds </paragraph>

  <title>admission into harvard business school with a     gmat score  clear admit s graham richmond shares how it might happen</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs   which publicly discloses the range of gmat scores by enrolled students every year  got folks in the mba admissions world talking when it revealed that a student with a score of     will be part of next year s class  how could someone who scored     points below the class median on a test considered by many to forecast business school success possibly still get in  to hbs  of all places  where only    percent of the close to       eager applicants this year secured a spot </paragraph>
    <paragraph>poetsandquants  p q  posed the question to the hbs admissions staff  which declined to shed any light on the successful candidate  so p q then turned to mba admissions consultants  clear admit s graham richmond among them  to guess about just what might be going on in the offices of hbs mba dean of admissions dee leopold  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for one thing  it seems like some schools must really mean it when they state that gmat scores are but one of many factors they take into consideration when carefully considering each candidate to build the strongest possible overall mba class  clear admit s richmond noted that it s hard for him to speculate without seeing the candidate s file for that very reason </paragraph>
    <paragraph> mba admissions at the very best schools is truly a multi variable equation  comprised of so many different factors that it can be hard to pull out a single data point and build the rest of the profile around it   he told p q  his fascination with the fact that there are so many different moving parts and that each candidate is given a fair chance is part of what compelled him to take a job in admission at wharton and ultimately to co found clear admit  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but if speculate he must  richmond suggested that in order to be accepted in spite of the unusually low  by hbs standards  gmat score  the candidate would almost definitely have to have excelled consistently in every other part of the application   undergraduate profile  work experience  outside activities  letters of recommendation  leadership skills  personal background  and even that would not have been enough  he continued   as such  i would venture that the candidate also had something fairly incredible in their background   likely leadership oriented   that truly made an impact   he told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>knowing leopold and the admissions team she leads at hbs   which would only be looking to admit a candidate who could fit right into the rigorous  case method driven hbs classroom   richmond further points out that they probably looked extremely closely at the academic portion of the candidate s file  considering not only the gpa but also the caliber of the undergraduate institution  the rigor of specific courses completed and other evidence of academic aptitude to offset the gmat score  such as outside coursework  comments in letters or recommendation letters  etc     they might also consider any extenuating circumstances around the gmat result itself   e g  if the candidate lives in a remote market and was only able to fly to a test site to sit the exam once amidst a busy work schedule   richmond pointed out to p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to all of this  richmond still puts his money on the candidate having had some sort of unprecedented leadership experience   for example  i recently learned that the head of the nfl players union was admitted to hbs   and although i have no idea how that candidate s academic profile measured up  it s clear that having that sort of incredible leadership background made him highly competitive for a spot in the hbs class   he told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  all of these things together wouldn t be enough to overcome the gmat score unless they were presented as part of a compelling overall application complete with cogent  thought provoking essays  powerful letters of recommendations from people who really know the candidate  and an out of the park interview   finally  i d add that it wouldn t hurt if the candidate also happened to come from an under represented portion of the applicant pool   be it socioeconomically  ethnically  industry wise or geographically   richmond concluded </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s kevin chen gives advice to asian mba applicants targeting top business schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>navigating the mba admissions process in the united states and europe is a tricky task  even for applicants familiar with the expectations of the western academic and corporate cultures  however  the process presents special challenges for east asian applicants  who often possess cultural assumptions that can work to their disadvantage  clear admit admissions counselor kevin chen has nearly a decade of mba admissions consulting expertise  and has worked extensively with asian applicants to help them overcome these cultural hurdles and gain admission to top mba programs including harvard business school  stanford gsb  wharton  chicago booth  insead and london business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chen  who is fluent in english  chinese and taiwanese  has been a successful applicant himself  he holds master s degrees from both stanford s graduate school of business and harvard s kennedy school of government  he also has a wealth of relevant professional experience  as a consultant  marketing professional and writer for firms including mckinsey   company  the national basketball association and reuters  the largest global news agency  last week  clear admit spoke with chen about the common missteps and trends he observes in asian mba applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> ca  gaining admission to top business programs may be particularly competitive for asian applicants  given this fact  what general pieces of advice would you give young professionals from asia about how to stand out during the mba application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  my first piece of advice would be this  when answering essay questions  it is paramount that applicants directly respond to the actual questions being asked  before providing additional or tangential information that they feel supports these responses  this is different from the way many asian cultures tend to communicate which is to provide general background information and analysis first  and often only explicitly answering the question at hand in their concluding lines  american and european admissions committees really prefer to know the overall direction or point a writer is trying to make from the outset </paragraph>
    <paragraph>furthermore  when discussing accomplishments  i tell asian applicants to focus on the impact they created rather than the awards that they won  admissions committees are more interested in the contributions an applicant has made to a larger organization than in the praise an applicant received for doing so  similarly  do not discuss getting into a prestigious school or receiving a job offer from a prestigious company as an accomplishment  in the eyes of the admissions committees  it is only an accomplishment if you can demonstrate how specifically you ve made good use of the opportunities from getting into a prestigious school or company </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  as an admissions counselor  what are some common misconceptions about the mba admissions process you ve encountered when advising asian applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  i would say there are four key misconceptions i ve encountered </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first  many asian applicants mistakenly believe that it s fine to quit your job just because you re applying to business school studying for the gmat is not a legitimate reason for quitting your job  admissions committee officers expect you to be able to  walk and chew gum at the same time  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>second  many asian applicants try too hard to be  different  e g  trying to pretend to be an entrepreneur when nothing in the background points to being an entrepreneur </paragraph>
    <paragraph>third  many asian applicants mistakenly believe that it s a great strategy to get a recommendation letter from the most senior executive  even when it s clear to the admissions committee that the senior executive really would not have worked with the applicant extensively </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fourth  and finally  many asian applicants believe that  ranking  dictates almost      how hard or easy it is to get into a school  and that  if i get rejected from school a  and school a is generally ranked higher than school b  then i must have no shot at getting into school b so i shouldn t even try   the reality is that admissions committees also take into account the applicant s fit with the school in terms of their personality  interests  background and goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  broadly  what trends would you say you observed in asian applicants to mba programs this year  and how does this differ from what you ve observed over the course of your time at clear admit </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  i would say more asian applicants are now considering asia based business schools  such as ceibs  china europe international business school  in china and hkust  hong kong university of science and technology  in hong kong </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  specifically  what did you observe about these applicants in terms of target schools  what about in terms of post mba target industries </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  asian applicants tend to weigh the brand prestige of schools even more heavily than american and european applicants  to put it bluntly  you can look at the us news   world report rankings and figure out almost      where the applicants would like to go  in the exact order of preference </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of post mba target industries  a much greater percentage of asian applicants want to go into management consulting and investment banking because outside those two industries  compensation in other industries in asia drops off sharply  in other words  there are fewer high paying industries for post mba grads in asia than in the u s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ca  in your experience  what s the proportion of asian applicants who intend to return to their home countries after receiving an mba  versus those who want to remain in the united states or work elsewhere abroad </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kc  from what i ve observed  most tend to want to do a few years abroad  mostly in the u s   before returning to their home countries  but whether or not they succeed in finding a job in the u s  depends on the economic situation of any particular year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this preference for working abroad before returning home is partly for the personal experience of working overseas  and partly for a professional reason those who have overseas work experience tend to be able to get higher paying positions after they return to their home countries </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit weighs in on nyu stern s top place among undergrads in bloomberg businessweek survey</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a recent article about the most sought after business schools for undergraduate students  new york university s stern school of business topped the short list  along with harvard business school  columbia business school  the university of chicago booth school of business and stanford graduate school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg businessweek  which reported the top five as lead up to its      undergraduate business school rankings  which will be published later this month  expressed surprise at nyu stern s inclusion in the mix </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but clear admit co founder graham richmond told bloomberg bw that he thinks stern s mid tier ranking overall is  in fact  a benefit when it comes to attracting potential applicants   when you pick the list of schools you re applying to  you usually have a couple of reach schools  a couple of schools right down the middle and then a couple of safety schools   he told bloomberg bw   nyu is versatile enough that it ends up on a lot of people s lists  in some cases it s the reach school  and in others it s the safety  depending on the candidate   he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as part of bloomberg bw s      undergraduate business school ranking  senior business school students were asked about their future plans  of those  more than        said that they were planning to pursue an mba in the next five years  and of the prospective mba students     percent named stern as a target school  compared to    percent for harvard business school and uptown rival columbia business school     percent for the university of chicago s booth school of business  and    percent for stanford s graduate school of business   bloomberg bw notes that respondents could choose more than one target school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit s richmond notes that nyu stern s location in new york city could be a factor in how highly it ranked as a target school among prospective business school applicants   there must be a new york bias   he told bloomberg bw   because that s where the jobs are  </paragraph>

    <paragraph> the increase among chinese women is miraculous   elissa ellis sangster  executive director of the forte foundation  a consortium of companies and business schools working to advance women in business  told bloomberg businessweek   i think it s a great story of the global economy  and i do think developing countries will start to take a closer look at women and their impact on the workforce   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the trio of reports from gmac also revealed other key trends about test takers  including the fact that younger people make up a greater percentage of test takers than in the past  specifically     percent of test takers in testing year      were younger than     up from    percent in       and in asian and european countries  more than half of all test takers were under     gmac reports </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler discusses preparing mba applicants for wharton s team based discussion</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>rather than simulating a group interview  clear admit admissions consultants are preparing mba applicants for the new team based discussion  tbd  component of the university of pennsylvania s wharton school application by helping them focus and hone the ideas they will present as part of the exercise  senior admissions counselor stacey oyler told poetsandquants  p q  as part of an article published yesterday </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we decided that trying to simulate a group interview wasn t the ideal approach for prepping candidates   oyler told p q  instead  she and other clear admit admissions counselors are helping clients focus on the compelling ideas they will present as part of the tbd  setting expectations for what the interview setting will be like   including the types of other applicants they may be grouped with   and sharing insight about what wharton will be assessing  oyler continued  clear admit  founded by two wharton mba alumni  including one who worked in the wharton admissions office after graduating  prides itself on its wharton expertise   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in its current form  wharton applicants invited to take part in the tbd view a video of dean thomas robertson discussing the school s three pillars   social impact  global presence and innovation   and are then asked how they would invest a hypothetical    million donation  wharton introduced the tbd component as an official part of the application process this year in an effort to  assess applicants in  an unscripted environment   free from the influence of admission consultants and other advice givers   according to the p q article </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in response  some other admissions consulting firms have opted to create new offerings   online simulations designed to mimic the tbd   to help prepare applicants who are anxious about the new component of wharton s application  p q reports  prospective applicants pay between      and      each to participate with other prospective applicants as part of these mock discussions  p q adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at clear admit  preparation for the wharton tbd comes as part of its traditional admissions consulting offerings  oyler told p q   we talk with clients about the three pillars and encourage them to come up with great ideas for each one   oyler continued   we work with them on fine tuning their elevator pitch  and we know from our own group interview experience that wharton is looking for candidates who can showcase strong interpersonal skills and who are able to facilitate the discussion while contributing their own unique ideas and encouraging thoughts from others  </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler sheds light on mba summer internship hiring process at top firms like mckinsey</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>it s first year internship recruiting season at business schools across the united states  as students scramble to line up interviews with potential employers  they confront a complex process made even more complicated by the demands of their first year core coursework and other campus commitments  last week  clear admit spoke with stacey oyler  a clear admit admissions consultant and former mckinsey   co  mba recruiter  to shed light on this process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after joining mckinsey  oyler initiated a formal recruiting process for the firm on the campus of dartmouth s tuck school of business  her familiarity with the school she worked previously as the assistant director of admissions at tuck and its approach to the recruiting process allowed her great insight into how mckinsey could approach potential new hires  for example   one unique thing about tuck is that they have a bid list   said oyler   you  as a student  are given a certain number of points that you can use towards bidding on interviews   oyler said about     of mckinsey s total number of interview slots were reserved for bid students   of the remaining     we got to choose who we wanted to see  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of oyler s key pieces of advice was to be flexible geographically   we would have students list three offices where they would be willing to work  and nine times out of ten students chose only the  sexiest  places   she said   these included cities like new york  san francisco and london  but ultimately  the less glamorous offices are the ones with openings   what ends up happening is that the office decides based on  a student s indication of  location who they want to see   so if you ve only indicated that you re willing to work in new york  san fransisco or london  an office in philadelphia that has positions open may not even consider your application </paragraph>
    <paragraph> don t think about geography as where you want to live   said oyler   think about where you would be valued and where you could most utilize your skill set  students never say that they want to work in cleveland  but cleveland needs people  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> do you want to work in boston   she summarized bluntly   or do you want to work at mckinsey  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the management consulting interview process itself which oyler clarified differs from that of other industries is well defined  it consists of two rounds  one on campus interview with a recruiter  followed by on site interviews at office locations if applicants clear the first round  it may be surprising for some to learn that this internship interview process is exactly the same as for full time positions    we had  a bar  and  weren t  going to lower that bar for summer internships   said oyler </paragraph>
    <paragraph>each interview begins with ten minutes of resume review followed by a thirty minute business case  drawn from a large book of potential cases   the consultants conducting the interview pick their favorites  usually by industry   oyler said  noting that there s also a constant process of weeding out old cases that have been leaked and used as preparation material by applicants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s understandable that first year students want to know how they can excel during their interviews  but just as important to their success is knowing how to avoid committing a fatal mistake   the single biggest mistake students make in their interviews   oyler said   is that they are afraid of silence  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the cases used by management consulting firms like mckinsey require the applicant to solve fairly complex business problems on the spot  but they don t require or expect them to solve it instantaneously  said oyler </paragraph>
    <paragraph> students are often so afraid that if they spend too long working on a problem they won t look smart   she said   then they rush  and they build an entire business case around the wrong number  as an example   even if they get everything else right  it s hard to say they performed well if they got the data wrong and the wrong answer  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> thoughtful silence is so much better than speaking and hoping your mind catches up with your mouth   she added   it never does  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>oyler described the interviews themselves as an extremely meritocratic process   our goal was  whoever does well goes on   said oyler   there is no target number or quota we were trying to get to   moreover  she said that many of the best applicants she recruited at tuck came from non traditional backgrounds fields like journalism or the liberal arts  which are underrepresented at business schools   a lot of people want to do consulting  but they don t think they have the background   she said  acknowledging that in certain cases students do benefit from a degree of specialization and expertise in one field   but it s really about problem solving and critical thinking  and anybody can do that  leaders are problem solvers at the end of the day  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>often even more impressive than the non traditional applicants  in oyler s experience  were the bid candidates students who may have sacrificed interview opportunities at other firms to ensure getting a shot at their dream internship   they want it more   she observed   often  when we would select someone  they would also interview with bain  bcg  boston consulting group    firms that along with mckinsey constitute the so called  big three  strategy consulting firms   but if you have this candidate who puts all of his bid points on mckinsey  he will probably be really prepared  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>most of all  oyler stressed that the students who put in the effort are those who nail the cases   if you are willing to try really hard and pore over cases for hours and hours  you ll do well   she said   this is something you can prepare for  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>you re a first year mba student who has just completed a grueling round of interviews and landed an internship at your dream firm  congratulations  what can you expect your summer job to look like  the eight week internship experience is structured to be simultaneously positive and challenging  according to oyler </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at consulting firms like mckinsey  mba interns are treated as  summer associates   responsible for performing the same duties as new hires for full time positions  if interns perform well over the course of the summer  they may earn full time offers with the firm   you keep the bar high during internship interviews precisely for this reason   said oyler </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to acclimating students to the demands of the industry  the internship is designed to leave them with a positive impression of the firm   offices are making an effort to put them  interns  on interesting projects   she said   this is because firms hope to ensure a  high yield  of students who accept full time offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you are wined and dined but also evaluated   said oyler   overall  it is a pretty intense experience  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what does this information mean for business school applicants  for whom first year summer internships are just a distant light at the end of the long mba application tunnel  it s all about understanding as early as possible what you want to do with your mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>large firms like mckinsey recruit mbas primarily from a small number of  core  schools  while mckinsey doesn t reveal the names of these programs  and oyler is bound by confidentiality not to share them  she did reveal that students at these schools have a key advantage when it comes to securing internships   a mckinsey consultant  typically an alumnus or alumna of the school  is often staffed at each of these schools during the school year to host office hours and brown bag lunches  helping students prepare for case interviews and learn more about the firm </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on the other hand  a single recruiting team oversees mckinsey mba recruiting for all non core mba programs  this underscores how essential it is that applicants do their due diligence on target schools    it s very important that applicants have some ideas and are looking at career prospects for their schools of interest  if you re dead set on working for a big three consulting firm   oyler said   you have to find out where they are recruiting  why spend          on a school if the company you want to work for doesn t recruit there  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this point applies across firms  industries and continents  one student seeking a job in the energy industry  for instance  might develop a drastically different list of target schools than a student considering a career in management consulting  as a general rule  the key is to be proactive about defining your career goals and diligent about researching mba programs that fit them </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this should be factored into your school decision making process   oyler concluded   you need a return on your investment  right  </paragraph>

  <title>new wharton  hbs research reveals last interviewee of the day often fares worst</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a recent research paper co authored by professors from the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and harvard business school reveals that mba applicants interviewing at the end of a day after a series of strong candidates are more likely to receive a lower evaluation than they would otherwise </paragraph>
    <paragraph>terming the phenomenon  narrow bracketing   the researchers conjectured that interviewers charged with evaluating a subset of applicants in a given day tended to try to provide evaluations in keeping with the overall expectations for the entire interview pool  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> for instance  an interviewer who has already highly recommended three applicants on a given day may be reluctant to do so for a fourth applicant   wrote uri simonsohn  an operations and information management professor at wharton  and francesca gino  an associate professor of business administration at hbs  data from more than       mba admissions interviewers supported the prediction </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the paper  entitled  daily horizons  evidence of narrow bracketing in judgment from    years of mba admission interviews   was published in the february      issue of psychological science  the researchers found that a similarly qualified applicant who interviewed on the tail end of a series of top scoring applicants got worse than expected evaluations  in the reverse situation  when a similarly qualified applicant interviewed after a group of weaker competitors  that applicant got better than expected evaluations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>simonsohn and gino hypothesize that an interviewer may be reluctant to give high ratings to the last candidate in a string of highly rated candidates because he or she knows that only a certain percentage of individuals are accepted into a program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> an interviewer who expects to evaluate positively about    percent of applicants in a pool may be reluctant to evaluate positively many more or fewer than    percent of applicants on any given day  an applicant who happens to interview on a day when several others have already received a positive evaluation would  therefore  be at a disadvantage   they write </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the problem with this narrow bracketing behavior is that the subsets arbitrarily created by the scheduling of the interviews should not influence the interviewers  judgments   while the merit of an mba applicant may partially depend on the pool of applicants that year  it should not depend on the few others randomly interviewed that day   simonsohn and gino write </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though they studied mba applicant interviews specifically  the researchers say that the phenomenon of narrow bracketing is not confined to academic admissions  indeed  the same dynamic could play out whenever individuals are spreading similar decisions out over multiple days   be they decisions about applicants for loans at a bank or candidates interviewing for a job </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in any setting where people have to make a large set of judgments that is broken down into a small set on the same day  you might see the same thing   simonsohn notes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so what can applicants do to counteract the narrow bracketing effect  not much  simonsohn and gino say   there s no magic in this for the user  you can t see who you re competing against and often can t control the timing of your interview   when the candidates are spread out over weeks and weeks  your competition is the entire applicant pool and not a subset of that  but in reality  your competition is drawn from two pools   everyone and the other applicants who get interviewed that day  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the researchers do  however  offer suggestions for low cost  low risk ways companies and universities could seek to control for the effect  such as having interviewers enter each applicant s scores into a spreadsheet or database program that would help them monitor the results of their interviews over time  taking the focus off a given day s candidates </paragraph>

  <title>university of chicago booth school of business uses technology to connect campuses around the globe</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last month  the university of chicago booth school of business debuted a new telepresence technology it hopes will help establish a  new global connectivity  between faculty and students at the school s main chicago campus and those in other locations around the globe  such as london and singapore </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the technology   enhanced videoconferencing featuring superior sight and sound fidelity   enabled chicago booth professor of economics kevin murphy to deliver a one hour lecture on the importance of human capital to economic growth to executive mba students in main lecture auditorium at chicago booth s london campus  inaugurating the new technology  murphy delivered his lecture live from a studio in the harper center  which houses the full time mba program in chicago  while students in london used desk mounted microphones to ask questions and interact with the professor  murphy  for his part  could control three cameras stationed in the london auditorium  directing them on the questioner and other students in the classroom </paragraph>
    <paragraph>robert gertner  deputy dean for chicago booth s part time program  said that the technology is intended to connect booth s global campuses by allowing all faculty members to reach students across all the locations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think it accomplished the goal   gertner said after the lecture   it was a way more interactive experience than listening to a web version of a presentation  the live nature makes it easier to absorb the material  and the ability to ask questions makes it closer to being live than watching a webcast  it will only get better as people get better at using it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>going forward  chicago booth will use the telepresence technology to broadcast sessions with other faculty and guest speakers from the harper studio  as well as to conduct remote review sessions before exams </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this was the first use of a technology that is designed not to be a substitute for faculty being here  but as a complement and a way for us to bring more of the faculty to the students who are not in chicago   gertner said </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>how to become better active listeners  how to provide constructive feedback  how to establish collaborative environments conducive to innovative thinking   these are among the valuable  soft  skills mba students at the haas school of management at the university of california at berkeley are learning as part of a new program called teams haas </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program  which debuted this year during haas orientation week  is a new component of the berkeley innovative leader development  bild  curriculum  full time mba students dove into the new initiative last fall by forming diverse semester long study groups and together developing collaboration plans for working across boundaries  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> unlike when we operate as individuals and we can practice reflexivity  in a group we need to carve out time to exchange information and understand how we perceive the situation   brandi pearce  an organizational behaviorist who leads the new program  explained </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the groups took part in diagnostic and feedback sessions after a month  individuals had the opportunity to describe anonymously how the team was functioning at periodic checkpoints  and all students completed a survey at the semester s end showing highlighting the evolution of the teams and best practices </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students praised the inaugural teams haas program   while we had all worked on teams in our previous jobs  haas challenged us by putting us in more diverse teams than those we experienced at work   said felice espiritu  mba mph     espiritu was in a group that included students from switzerland  india  the east coast and a range of industries   but haas also gave us the resources to set us up for success and deal with issues that arose in a way that focused on our long term personal goals and leadership development   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>espiritu s team reached out to pearce for help as it encountered challenges  and pearce was at the ready to assist   what brandi helped facilitate was establishing the group norm for how we communicate with each other and how we work with each other what s acceptable  what s not and how we prioritize our work   espiritu said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this semester  pearce and a team of coaches will work with full time and part time mba students to help bring some of the teams haas skills to bear as part of group projects they participate in during their required experiential learning courses </paragraph>

  <title>plagiarized admissions essays doom mba applicants at top schools  again</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>fifteen prospective applicants to ucla s anderson school of management and another    at penn state s smeal college of business got dinged when a plagiarism spotting service revealed that portions of their admissions essays had been lifted from other sources  bloomberg businessweek reports today  the schools say those numbers are likely to grow in subsequent admissions rounds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>both smeal and anderson use a service called turnitin for admissions  which checks admissions essays against a database of published and unpublished sources and flags similarities  in total  about    schools use turnitin  according to company spokesman chris harrick  but only four have publically disclosed that fact   northeastern s d amore mckim school of business and wake forest schools of business also make their use of turnitin public  though no applicants have been rejected for plagiarism at either school so far this year  bloomberg bw reports   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>last year  anderson rejected    applicants for plagiarism as part of the first two rounds  andrew ainslie  senior associate dean for the full time mba program  told bloomberg bw that he expects that as many as    applicants may be rejected for plagiarism this year by the end of the third and final round </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to craig hubbell  director of operations for mba admissions at anderson  most of the applicants who have been discovered plagiarizing this year borrowed passages from essay websites  although some were brazen   or stupid   enough to lift from bloomberg bw and even anderson s own website </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the bloomberg bw report  anderson doesn t disclose its use of turnitin to applicants  and it only rejects students whose essays include a significant amount of poached text   if somebody uses a famous quote in an essay  we re not going to highlight it   ainslie told bloomberg bw   when it does occur  it s because they took a big chunk   like one applicant last year who lifted    percent of an essay and failed to change the gender of the pronouns  hubbell gave as an example to bloomberg bw </paragraph>

    <paragraph>according to ft business education editor della bradshaw  hbs was able to rise to the top of the rankings thanks in part to its new dean   one of the things we measure in our rankings is the international perspective and achievement of the programs   bradshaw said in a video interview on the ft site   dean nitin nohria  who is the first harvard dean born outside north america  has taken over and has brought that ethos to the school   she continued  hbs also has added new compulsory oversees elements for its students as part of its mba program  which bradshaw believes may have helped hbs regain ground as well  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of larger trends  bradshaw noted that canadian and european business schools are falling in the rankings as asian schools move up  the top     mba schools include    from asia this year  the most ever  among european schools  business schools in the united kingdom have slipped the most  though london business school has ranked in the top five for the past decade and cambridge s judge school moved up an impressive    spots this year to number     five u k schools fell out of the top     completely  overall     u k  schools made the rankings  down from    in      </paragraph>

  <title>bloomberg businessweek taps clear admit for insight on business school admissions in india</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>only      percent of applicants to india s top business school were admitted for the         academic period  making stanford graduate school of business  with a   percent acceptance rate  and harvard business school     percent  look easy to get into by comparison  according to a recent bloomberg businessweek article  bloomberg bw turned to clear admit co founder graham richmond to provide a little context </paragraph>
    <paragraph> india s population is so large  particularly among young people  it s easy for  iima  to have the luxury of making one huge cut   richmond told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  iima received         applications for the class of       compared with stanford s        and cut         of them  largely according to entrance exam scores  all iima applicants are required to take india s common application test  or cat </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nunzio quacquarelli  director of the qs world mba tour  told bloomberg bw that most of the people he sees applying to iim s    schools are indian  around    years old and have one or two years of work experience  in contrast  bw data reveals that applicants to stanford average    years old and have almost five years of work experience  giving admissions committees much more to compare </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while using the cat to reject such a huge percentage of applicants to iima may also make dealing with the sheer volume of applications possible  some question whether it provides the best indicator of how well students will fare in business school  mba world tour s quacquarelli notes that more test centric admissions may result in less diversity  noting that an overwhelming majority of iima students come from engineering backgrounds and that the school has fewer female students than other internationally recognized business schools </paragraph>

  <title>professor from uva s darden school of business sends mba students to prison to teach entrepreneurship</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>entrepreneurship education is spreading like wildfire  with top business schools enhancing their offerings by launching new institutes  expanding curriculum components and investing more in business incubators  a professor at the darden school of business at the university of virginia at charlottesville sees no reason why it should stop there  through a program he launched last year  he s sending darden students armed with the case study method into prisons to teach inmates how to start small businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>greg fairchild  associate professor at darden  studies entrepreneurship and business development in inner cities and other underserved areas and has published on topics ranging from the effects of residential segregation on entrepreneurship to the evolution of community development financial institutions  cdfis   last year  fairchild and a group of students traveled to houston to visit a nonprofit called prison entrepreneurship program  pep   which recruits mba students from around the country to help inmates develop business plans  pep s goal is to reduce recidivism by equipping inmates with business and life skills they can use upon release  according to pep s annual report  only   percent of its graduates end up back in jail  compared to the    percent of overall inmates released from the texas department of criminal justice who return to prison within three years  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the outgrowth of fairchild s visit to pep was a new program at darden called resilience education  through which darden mbas provide entrepreneurship education for inmates at two prisons in virginia  to qualify  inmates must first complete the prison s vocational education program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> a lot of the students say they have never been in a classroom where they have felt this engaged before   fairchild told bloomberg businessweek   the inmates feel inspired that darden students and faculty are coming to see them and teaching  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rates of recidivism are even greater in virginia than they are in texas  with about    percent of inmates returning to prison within three years  according to bloomberg bw  fairchild hopes to see that rate drop below    percent for graduates of the resilience education program  he told bloomberg bw  although it s too soon to tell the program s success since none of the participating inmates have been released yet  fairchild told bloomberg bw that he doesn t have immediate plans to increase the size of the program beyond the    mba volunteers it now includes  though he d be happy to see other business schools embrace similar efforts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fairchild will deliver a seminar entitled  entrepreneurship education in the prison system  next month in houston as part of darden s ideas to action speakers forum </paragraph>

  <title>smaller paychecks for mbas  not for graduates from top schools</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a wall street journal article yesterday called into question the value of the mba  suggesting that pay for recent graduates is stagnant or falling while tuition and fees continue to escalate  indeed  tuition rates do seem to be climbing everywhere  but at top tier schools  starting salaries are increasing as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wsj article cited survey results from the graduate management admissions council indicating that median salary for newly minted mbas was flat between      and       the gmac survey included results from more than     mba programs  data collected by clear admit from    of the most elite mba programs in the united states  meanwhile  revealed that at all but three schools  average starting salaries for graduates of the class of      were higher than those for the class of       by between   and    percent  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tuition increases  however  are outpacing salary increases at these top schools  total costs   including tuition and fees   rose at all    of the schools from which clear admit collected data between      and       and in almost all cases  the increase in costs was greater than the rise in average starting salary </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wsj article highlighted another important fact about the mba landscape  namely that there has been an explosion in the number of degrees granted in recent years  citing department of education figures  the wsj article reported that the         mbas granted in         by u s  schools represents a    percent jump from a decade earlier  as brooks holtom  a management professor at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business  told the wsj   an mba is a club that is now not exclusive  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  just as the number of mba degrees has grown  so  too  has the number of alternatives to the traditional two year mba program  now the graduate management education space is crowded with full time  part time  executive and online mbas  as well as many new specialized masters degree programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>these trends together mean that now as never before it is important to consider reputation  accreditation and location among several other key factors before taking the mba plunge </paragraph>

  <title>admissions myths debunked as round two deadline approaches at university of chicago booth school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with its round two deadline coming up tomorrow  january  th  at   p m  chicago time   associate director of admissions joanne legler devoted a recent post on the booth insider blog to debunking some common myths about the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>contrary to what some prospective applicants may think  a campus visit is not a requirement for admissions   while we d love to get everyone who applies to see our campus in person  we realize it s just not possible for everyone to make their way to chicago   legler writes  her team strongly encourages applicants to visit if at all possible  since doing so is one of the best ways to truly get a feel for the school  but those who can t will not be disadvantaged in the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>legler also underscored the fact that chicago booth does not have any minimum gpa or gmat gre requirements  nor does it have a minimum requirement for years of work experience   we really encourage applicants to apply when they are ready   legler writes   that s different for everyone and we see applicants who are successful as early career candidates with two or three years or work experience  as well as more seasoned professionals who decide much later in their careers to apply for the mba  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in short order  legler goes on to upend a few more misconceptions  stating for the record that chicago booth is looking for applicants from all industries  not just finance and consulting backgrounds  that it is possible to be admitted in the third round  though far fewer spots are left by then  so apply sooner if you can   and that you aren t at a disadvantage if you weren t a business major in college     percent of chicago booth students have a liberal arts background  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to letters of recommendation  legler s advice is to resist trying to impress the admissions committee with a letter from someone whose credentials outweigh how well they really know you   work with someone who knows you and your accomplishments  talents and skills well   she advises   your current or former supervisor and a colleague or client who can speak at length about your value to your company or organization is a much better choice than someone who may have an impressive title  but little insight into you as a person or future chicago booth student  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for those applicants fortunate enough to be invited to interview after submitting an application tomorrow  there is no advantage or disadvantage to interviewing with one type of interviewer over another  legler promises   regardless of who your interviewer may be  the feedback is used equally in each and every case   and all interviewers   both alumni and staff   have been carefully trained and will approach the interview blind  without having seen your application </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so there you have it  best of luck getting those applications ready for tomorrow s deadline </paragraph>

  <title>should career services staff weigh in on mba admissions decisions  wall street journal consults clear admit for insight</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the wall street journal recently turned to clear admit co founder graham richmond to get his take on a trend taking hold in mba admissions  namely  bringing in career services staff to evaluate candidates as part of the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a wsj article published today reports that admissions staff at several top mba programs  including ucla s anderson school of management  unc s kenan flagler business school and the university of toronto s rotman school of management  have begun to ask career services staff to sit in on committee meetings to help assess how realistic candidates  stated career goals are or otherwise inform the admissions process  schools are increasingly employing this more integrated approach in an effort to help admissions officers better understand which candidates will be more employable come graduation and ultimately boost schools  placement statistics </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for example  at the university of rochester s simon graduate school of business  the director of career services has for the past year and a half been meeting every couple of weeks with the admissions team  sharing information on which firms and industries are recruiting at the school and which types of students have fared best post graduation  at kenan flagler  meanwhile  career services staff now routinely train admissions staff to look for the same traits in prospective applicants that a hiring manager will look for in current students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit s richmond pointed out as part of the wsj article that involving career services staff in this way in the admissions process can benefit applicants  providing a key reality check for them early in the game  but he cautioned that looking too closely at employability and stated goals   that is  looking to only admit candidates who seem to be  sure things  for post mba employment   could lead to a very plain class and or cause applicants to keep riskier post mba plans to themselves </paragraph>
    <paragraph>balance is key when it comes to involving career services staff in the admissions process  richmond advises   having well defined   and feasible   career goals is important in terms of ensuring success in b school and beyond  but i also think that having a diverse class that heads off into dozens of industries and positions is pretty important  too   he says  career services offices can share with admissions that they are good at placing students in certain industries  so that the admissions team looks for applicants whose stated goals include those industries  but admissions officers should also push career services staff to open new doors with recruiters if they notice growing interest in the applicant pool in a new area  richmond offers </paragraph>
    <paragraph>read the full wsj article   mba pop quiz  are your employable   and don t miss clear admit s q a series with career services directors at top mba programs  we also feature a line of clear admit school selection guides  which are specifically designed to help applicants understand career specific offerings at the leading mba programs and identify the schools that will best support their career goals </paragraph>

  <title>bloomberg businessweek reports widening wage gap between men and women mba grads</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>female graduates from top mba programs average    cents for every dollar their male classmates earn  down from a high of    cents in       according to new research out this month from bloomberg businessweek  according to the magazine s biennial survey of mba graduates  women earn less than men at about a third of the top u s  business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>female graduates from the class of      at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania  for example  earned    percent of male wages  and those at stanford graduate school of business earned    percent  bloomberg bw reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the gap numbers at the beginning can sometimes be accounted for by differences in grades  course selection and the fields male and female graduates choose  according to marianne betrand  an economics professor at university of chicago booth school of business   what is much more striking is how much that gap grows over time   bertrand told bloomberg bw  citing studies on compensation among female booth mba grads </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg bw cited numerous sources revealing that pay disparity between men and women is greatest in the finance sector  for example       census data showed the largest gender pay gaps to be among insurance agents  personal advisors and securities sales agents </paragraph>
    <paragraph>catalyst  a nonprofit organization focused on expanding opportunities for women in business  published research the same year showing that female mbas were paid  on average         less in their first jobs than men  and that the gap widens to         by mid career   women s careers lag behind men from day one   anna beninger  a senior associate in catalyst s research department  told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in part  the pay discrepancies between male and female mba grads also reflect shifts in career choices female mbas are making  women have left the finance sector   where the highest salaries are found   in greater numbers  which drives down average female salaries </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there s a tremendous realization among women mbas that you don t have to march lockstep into banking   janet hanson  ceo of women s networking group    broads  told bloomberg bw   the industry is changing  and i think a lot of people are overwhelmed by the regulatory environment and the uncertainties in the industry  that perhaps makes the risk reward trade off very different   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>career services directors at top schools concur  noting that female mbas are attracted increasingly to the technology  consumer products  consulting and entrepreneurship sectors </paragraph>

  <title>forbes ranks the mba rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a column today  forbes magazine took a collective look at all five of the big mba rankings   its own  as well as those from bloomberg businessweek  the economist  the financial times and u s  news   and compiled the results into a  sort of ranking of the mba rankings  for       for prospective mba applicants looking to make sense of the different rankings  the piece was useful for its succinct summary of the various methodologies each publication employs to arrive at its list </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though  as the article stressed  they are in overly simple terms  the following provides a valuable cheat sheet to remind yourself which ranking measures which attributes of an mba program  and  perhaps by extension  which results are most aligned with what you value most in a program     forbes   does a simple calculation of roi   years out from business school  financial times   bases     of the ranking on post mba salaries   years after graduation  businessweek   emphasizes the satisfaction levels of two core stakeholders  students and recruiters  u s  news   world report   includes a survey of deans and mba directors  and uses gmat scores as part of student selectivity  economist   assesses the ability of the mba to open new career opportunities  as well as the international make up of the school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>today s forbes piece stressed a point that those of us here at clear admit like to make whenever we report the most recent rankings from any publication  which is that a school s ranking should never be the most influential factor in your decision of where to attain your mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in compiling its  mba   premiership       rankings  forbes noted the strikingly consistent strong performance of harvard business school  the university of chicago business school  stanford graduate school of business and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania in        with only a couple of exceptions  these four schools fill the first four places in every ranking   read the forbes piece </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the purposes of its mba   premiership rankings  forbes separated schools into four regions   the united states  europe  canada and asia pacific   and calculated overall performance as an average of each schools ranking position across the five rankings </paragraph>

  <title>former chicago booth  wharton admissions director extols virtues of admissions consultants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>rose martinelli  former dean of admissions at the university of chicago booth school of business  shared her thoughts on how admissions consultants can be of great help to applicants in the mba admissions process in a recent column in bloomberg businessweek </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martinelli  who also spent time working in admissions at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  is now a guest contributor to bloomberg bw s getting in blog  in a post last week  she shared her views on the role of admissions consultants  drawing parallels between their services and those of a trusted financial adviser  in particular  she says  admissions consultants can be very useful in helping answer candidates  specific questions about their candidacy and in guiding candidates through the application process   their structured approach as well as knowledge of different programs can provide customized recommendations based on your experience  developmental needs and career aspirations   she wrote  adding that she believes the advisory services offered by admissions consultants to be the most valuable  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martinelli stressed that the process for finding a good   and ethical   admissions consultant should be similar to one you would use to choose a counselor or financial adviser   a level of trust and comfort must exist between the two for you to give your best effort to get the best result   she noted  admissions consultants should not guarantee admission to a particular program  she added  because no one has that power in the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if i had my druthers  applicants would not need consultants   martinelli wrote   but then again  i guess i wouldn t need a financial adviser either  touche  </paragraph>

  <title>columbia business school hosts first women s week</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>earlier this month  columbia business school  cbs  hosted its first women s week  featuring speakers  networking opportunities and gatherings in boston  new delhi and singapore  as well as on cbs s manhattanville campus  sallie krawcheck      former ceo and chair of citi global wealth management  provided the keynote address  women s week  which took place from november   th through   th  was a joint venture of the dean s office  admissions  student affairs and alumni relations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in her address as part of the week s events  krawcheck told assembled students and faculty that she thinks women s careers can be viewed as  lattices instead of ladders   she shared her experiences in business and offered advice for how women can advance their careers while striking a balance between work and home  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>krawcheck  who also is a member of the cbs board of overseers  praised the recent national election for sending a record number of women to the senate   putting more women in government is a smart move   she said  citing research that has shown that compromise is more likely with women involved because they tend to focus more on long term outcomes and relationships </paragraph>
    <paragraph>krawcheck stressed that  women are not better than men  just different   but  she noted  diverse teams regularly best less diverse teams even when their members are less capable  companies should be aware of the deeper differences between male and female employees   including childbirth and nursing   and look at how those differences might impact career paths  for example  women live longer  are often healthier than men  and have real potential to ramp up their careers after children are grown   companies should move toward flexibility without shame  for employees    she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>margaret ryan      president of columbia women in business  cwib   praised the participation by both male and female students in the school s inaugural women s week   i think it was a wonderful way to celebrate the female community at the school while also fostering an open dialogue around the current challenges facing women in business today  </paragraph>

  <title>u s  news article cautions prospective applicants that diversity mba admissions events provide limited advantages</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>following a brouhaha earlier this month surrounding a feature published by bloomberg businessweek about which business schools have the most attractive female students  u s  news   world report today ran a piece about diversity oriented admissions events hosted by schools  participation in these events   which are targeted toward applicants who are women  veterans  lesbian  gay  bisexual or transgender  lgbt  or minorities   can be valuable  but only to a limited degree  the u s  news piece reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>they do offer an opportunity to meet and interact with admissions officials  but they don t necessarily provide an accurate representation of the actual business school experience  nor do they necessarily give participants an advantage in the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph> while these are pitched as a  day in the life   when you get on campus  you won t have that many people from similar backgrounds and will need to effectively build relationships with a much broader group of people   nicole lindsay  who runs the website diversity mba prep  told u s  news  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lindsay also warned against the dangers of prospective mba applicants presuming that their candidacy is stronger because they were invited to such events   these events can lull candidates into a comfort zone that isn t real   she told u s  news </paragraph>
    <paragraph>still  participants do get a chance to see the campus  meet with other prospective applicants  establish relationships with admissions officials and more  and in some instances  schools even foot the bill for room and board or waive application fees for participants  according to u s  news </paragraph>
    <paragraph> for those looking to gain every advantage when applying  these opportunities were something i wish i had known more about when i started the process   prospective mba applicants rachael waddell told u s  news   these weekends have provided so much meat to my applications and have been a determining factor in where i apply  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bloomberg businessweek  for its part  conceded that its online poll about which business schools have the most attractive female students and the article conveying the results was in poor taste  particularly given the gender gap that persists in mba cohorts  it issued a statement to the daily dot saying as much and pulled the pieces on november   th </paragraph>

  <title>university of chicago booth school of business  london business school top bloomberg businessweek      rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the university of chicago booth school of business and london business school topped this year s rankings of u s  and international mba programs respectively by bloomberg businessweek  the rankings  released yesterday  employed a methodology shift that resulted in some major shifts for schools toward the bottom of the list but had little impact on the top tier schools  the basic criteria  however  for how schools are judged remains the same at it has been for the past two decades  namely how well they serve their students and recruiters </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among u s  schools  there was no change at the very top  with chicago booth  harvard business school and the university of pennsylvania s wharton school claiming spots one  two and three respectively  as they did in       there was some minor jostling for position among the remaining schools in the top     but the notable shifts were advances by cornell s johnson school of management and carnegie mellon university s tepper school of business and drops by columbia business school  cbs  and uc berkeley s haas school of business  johnson jumped from    in      to   this year  and tepper moved up from    to     haas slid  meanwhile  from   in      to    this year  and cbs likewise fell from   to     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the top    u s  schools according to bloomberg bw s      rankings are as follow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>     chicago booth school of business      harvard business school      wharton school at the university of pennsylvania      stanford graduate school of business      kellogg school of management at northwestern university      fuqua school of business at duke university      johnson school of management at cornell university      ross school of business at the university of michigan at ann arbor      sloan school of management at massachusetts institute of technology     darden school of business at the university of virginia at charlottesville     tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university     tuck school of business at dartmouth college     haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley     columbia business school     kelley school of business at the university of indiana at bloomington</paragraph>
    <paragraph>among international mba programs  there was more movement in the top ranks  london business school jumped several spots  from   in       to knock insead from its      number one position  oxford university s said school sailed up the chart from    to    and spain s iese sidled up from    in      to   this year  even amid continuing employment challenges in that country </paragraph>

  <title>darden school of business admissions director provides video update on application process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>sara neher  dean of admissions at the university of virginia s darden school of business  shared a video this week updating applicants to the school on the admissions process  opportunities to meet with school officials around the globe and more  for round one applicants eagerly awaiting an invitation to interview  you ll want to check out what she has to say </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the round one deadline at darden was october   th  and neher and her team are excitedly reading applications  she shared  invitations to interview are beginning to come out in waves  she continued  her team started with applicants who live in the united states  hoping to give them time to make plans to travel to charlottesville to interview sometime in the second half of november or the first half of december  but she stressed that you shouldn t worry if you haven t already received an invitation to interview because they will continue to be sent out until early december  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her team will focus next on invitations to interview for candidates who will do so remotely via skype or with an alumnus of the school outside of the united states  invitations for interviews away from darden s campus or via skype will begin to go out later this week and continue on a rolling basis for several weeks  neher said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she stressed again that applicants who have not yet been invited to interview should not be concerned   applications are randomly assigned to readers and read in random order  and there are several hundred applications that have not been read yet   she said  round one decisions will be released on december   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>neher herself just returned from mexico city  istanbul  milan  madrid and chicago  perhaps you met up with her at a darden event in one of those cities  faculty will lead a few more events in december  including in moscow  lisbon and tokyo  to learn more about these or other remaining events elsewhere in the world  click here  the school will also soon begin to share information about coffee chats  informal events organized by current students when they travel back to their home countries over the winter break  neher said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in conclusion  she shared some specific information for candidates who are considering applying to darden through the consortium for graduate study in management  the first deadline to do so is november   th  and neher and her team intend to turn around interview invitations very quickly for candidates who apply by then in the hopes that they will be able to come to campus to interview sometime between november   th and december  nd  that way  consortium applicants will be able to interview with other round one applicants and arrive on campus while classes are still in session and students are still in residence  in the event that you are invited to interview as a consortium candidate but cannot make it to campus to interview in that short turnaround time  darden may not be able to get you a decision by december   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph> that s okay   neher said   there is no negative implication for you  but we want you to be able to see us when there are students in residence and get to know the school in december or november   she continued  so if you apply via the consortium  be on the lookout for an interview invitation right away and be prepared  if possible  to make some travel arrangements pretty quickly to get to charlottesville  she encouraged   view neher s complete video here </paragraph>

    <paragraph>ceibs  which opened    years ago  stepped up its efforts last year to secure a spot among the top tier business schools around the globe  it brought in john quelch  a former administrator at harvard business school and a former dean at london business school  to lead the charge  according to the wsj report  quelch has been trying to draw big name faculty members from elite schools with large salaries and generous perks  believing that outstanding faculty will draw outstanding students  which in turn will attract recruiters and establish a successful alumni body </paragraph>
    <paragraph>henry moon  a professor of organizational behavior who relocated to ceibs from lbs last year  told the wsj that a    percent pay raise  tax breaks  a housing subsidy and funding for his four sons  schooling helped convince him  before quelch called   i had never even heard of ceibs   moon told the wsj </paragraph>
    <paragraph>is quelch s investment in big name faculty paying off  ceibs has  entered the conversation  among applicants to top tier schools  clear admit s richmond told the wsj  but so far it s mostly just talk </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ceibs boasts that its students also apply to the best business schools in europe and the united states  but the wsj article suggests that though this may be true  they don t necessarily gain acceptance  leaving ceibs more of a fallback </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with its lower price tag          for international students and         yuan  or about          for chinese students for the    month mba program  and potential to serve as a gateway to chinese business opportunities  ceibs could still make inroads among applicants to top mba programs  but the wsj article points out that it faces tough competition from an influx of western business schools setting up shop in asia  so whether ceibs will do more than enter the conversation remains to be seen </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business releases class of      profile information</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a post last week to its mba admissions blog  the stanford graduate school of business  gsb  shared statistics on its incoming class of mbas  the class of      revealed some interesting shifts  including an all time high percentage of international students  a return to more typical levels of u s  minority student representation after a spike last year and a slight increase in work experience among incoming students </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there are many reasons for these fluctuations   wrote stanford mba admissions blogger victoria hendel de la o   with our small class size  even two students can  and do  shift a percentage here or there  but the most relevant factor is that our candidate pool is ever changing  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of the     new students who came to campus this year     percent are international students   an all time high   drawn from    countries outside of the united states  u s  minority representation  meanwhile  fell from last year s    year high of    percent to a  more typical level  of    percent   all types of diversity matter at stanford  our outreach efforts will continue to foster students whose unique perspectives will enhance our learning community   hendel de la o noted </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of students  career and educational backgrounds  the class of      showed only slight shifts   this year  a few more engineers and humanities majors joined the mba program  with a handful fewer students who studied business   hendel de la o wrote  noting that the breadth of undergraduate majors continues to amaze them  the industry mix changed only slightly as well  but the absolute number of schools and organizations represented by the incoming class also topped all previous records  with two thirds of new students the only people to come from their respective organizations </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  work experience inched up just a little  from     years last year to     years this year  representing a    year peak </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hendel de la o underscored the fact that stanford admits individuals  not categories   there are no quotas or targets in the admission process  and each applicant is evaluated entirely on his or her own merits  this is why we consider a class profile illustrative  rather than informative   she said </paragraph>

  <title>online chat hosted by u penn s wharton school admissions team answers applicants  questions regarding round one interviews</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania yesterday hosted an online chat in which members of its admissions staff answered participants  questions regarding the application process  including wharton s new team based discussion  tbd  interview </paragraph>
    <paragraph>round one applicants to wharton learned about the early evening chat in an email invitation that went out yesterday morning  both to applicants who had already been invited to interview and to those still awaiting an invitation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as admissions team members shared during the chat  invitations to interview are not sent out in any particular order  the period to receive an invitation began on october   rd and will continue through november  th  wharton does attempt to prioritize international application notification because of the travel involved  but notifications   including to international applicants   can be sent out at any time  up to and including the very last day of the notification period  the admissions team stressed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once an applicant receives an invitation to interview  he or she can go in and schedule an interview date  only certain interview times have been released to date  as part of an effort by wharton to hold time slots for candidates not invited to interview until later in the invitation period  additional interview times will be released in time  though the admissions team members did not share specifics regarding when </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several participants asked about the new tbd interview  which wharton piloted in previous admissions seasons but has only incorporated as an official part of the admissions process this year  according to the online chat  the tbd interview will be somewhat moderated  but candidates will have a lot of leeway to speak amongst themselves  once candidates confirm an interview date  they will be provided with two prompts to prepare for the tbd  the admissions team advised that candidates should spend about an hour preparing a response to each of the two prompts they receive </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in the team based discussions  we are looking for how you interact with a group of your peers to work on a real life business scenario   replied an admissions committee member to one of the questions posed during the online chat   however  we are not looking for any one specific answer to the prompts   it is more about how you engage with your group and solve the problem together   just as you will do in our classrooms  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>during the online chat  wharton s admissions team shared that the tbd topics will be the same for all round one interviews  and applicants will be asked one of the two questions as part of the group discussion  the tbd topics will likely change for round two  the team members shared </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the in person element of wharton s application process will include both the tbd and a       minute one on one discussion  much of the format of the one on one discussion will be determined by the interviewer  in some  applicants may be asked to share their opinions of the tbd  this component is also intended to offer candidates an opportunity to ask questions they may have about their candidacy </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a few final points that came out of yesterday s chat    applicants who have scheduled their interview dates can change them if necessary  but they must give up their current slot before being able to sign up for an alternate interview time    applicants who do not receive an invitation to interview by the end of the notification period on november  th will receive notification at that time that their application process is complete    the percentage of applicants wharton expects to invite to interview on average is    to    percent  but actual numbers will depend on the strength of the overall pool    final decisions regarding round one will be released on december   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck to all of you preparing to interview at wharton or awaiting an invitation  as always  remember that the clear admit wiki is a great place to share your wharton interview experiences and learn from those of others </paragraph>

  <title>business school admissions officers uncertain regarding new gmat integrated reasoning section  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as many current business school applicants prepare for the first time to submit gmat scores that include the newly launched integrated reasoning  ir  section  business schools are expressing uncertainty about the ways in which the new section may or may not have improved the entrance exam  according to a recent survey conducted by kaplan test prep </paragraph>
    <paragraph>noting that it is too early to pass judgment on the new section  kaplan this week released survey findings that suggest that business schools may not be as positive about the new section this year   now that it has launched   as they were in recent years when it was still in development </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in kaplan s      survey     percent of responding business school admissions officers said ir would make the gmat more reflective of the business school experience  down from    percent in kaplan s      survey  more admissions officers      percent   responded that they weren t sure if the new section would make the exam more reflective  this figure was up from    percent the year before  of admissions officers polled  only   percent last year said the new ir section would not make the exam more reflective  that figure rose to    percent in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>asked whether the new section will make the exam more reflective of work in business and management after business school     percent responded  do not know   compared to    percent who said yes and    percent who said no </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so  how important will the ir scores be in the evaluation process at business schools  uncertainty dominates here  with    percent of respondents saying they are undecided at this point  twenty two percent responded that ir scores will be important  and    percent said they will not be </paragraph>
    <paragraph> schools generally prefer to gather performance data on a new test or test section before fully incorporating it into their evaluation process   andrew mitchell  director of pre business programs for kaplan test prep  said in a statement   not all applicants in      will submit gmat scores with an ir component  we can expect that  as more data is available  schools will determine clear policies  in which integrated reasoning may play a key role  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mitchell cautioned that gmat test takers should not  however  take the ir section any less seriously than the other sections in the meantime </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kaplan polled     business school admissions officers   including    from the nation s top    mba programs as ranked by u s  news   world report   for this survey by telephone between august and september      </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>this year marks the   th anniversary of harvard business school  hbs  s first female class of mbas  and students earlier this month kicked off a yearlong celebration with an event sponsored by the hbs women s student association  wsa   among the things to celebrate  according to an article recounting the event in harvard gazette  is the fact that women have grown from a mere eight members of that initial co ed class to represent    percent of the current mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>speakers at the october  th kickoff event included debora spar  president of barnard college  and youngme moon  donald k  david professor of business administration and chair of the hbs mba program  anne marie slaughter  a princeton professor who recently wrote  why women still can t have it all  for the atlantic  was scheduled for a second event on october   th as part of a yearlong speaker series organized by the wsa </paragraph>
    <paragraph>moon noted that the school will mark the milestone  not by congratulating ourselves on a job well done  but rather by using the opportunity to explore the issues and challenges that women continue to face in business and in the world at large   according to the harvard gazette article   the truth is we ve come a long way  but we are not by any measure where we need to be   she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>spar  a former junior faculty member at hbs  addressed a crowd made up largely of women  sharing her perspective of modern feminism   we inherited a set of expectations that  at the moment  are actually dooming us to failure   she said  in addition to her time at hbs and now as head of an all female college  she also serves as a board member for investment firm goldman sachs  experiences she drew on for her speech  as well as a recent newsweek cover story and a new book she is writing due out next fall </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit facebook contest winner reports back on kaplan gmat prep course</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last spring  in anticipation of the current mba admissions cycle  we featured a contest on facebook in which participants had the chance to win a kaplan gmat classroom  anywhere course to help them prepare to take the gmat business school entrance exam  one lucky winner   ebony brooks   snagged the prize  a nine session virtual prep course featuring access to       practice problems  nine cat exams and more than     hours of practice and instruction </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brooks  a pr manager in atlanta  ga  signed up for and completed the course over the summer  we caught up with her last week to hear her thoughts on the class  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kaplan s gmat classroom  anywhere course is held in a virtual classroom  featuring a live video feed to an instructor and teaching assistants  during online class meetings  students can ask questions and interact with their instructor and fellow students using the chat  polling and screen sharing functions </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brooks praised the structure of the course  the quality of the teaching and the flexibility of the online delivery model   i was really impressed with the actual virtual classroom   she said   i didn t take a lot of online classes during undergrad so i was a little nervous taking a class in a virtual way  but it was very accessible   she liked being able to log into her own personal account  see her professor and communicate with other students via chat  she noted that the professor and ta were very accessible both in and out of class  replying to follow up questions promptly each time she contacted them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>asked what she might have changed about the course  she said that she would have liked it to include more time for students to do problems together in real time   i get that the purpose was to allow you to do it on your own  but i have come to learn that everyone thinks differently  there were many times in class where two or three people would approach the problem in a different way and arrive at the same answer  i found that very helpful  so i would have liked more time to go through problems   especially quantitative problems   that way  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she appreciated the fact that the course featured sections focused on each portion of the gmat  including the test s newly added integrated reasoning section  for brooks personally  the sections on math were especially important  since many of those skills are not ones she uses currently in her daily job as a pr manager for a healthcare firm </paragraph>
    <paragraph>thrilled to win her course and get to complete it for free  brooks did say that she thinks it s a great value at        i think it is worth the money  and i think it is a cost effective offering   she said  she added that she would consider taking supplemental courses offered by kaplan to continue honing the skills she ll need to be successful on the gmat </paragraph>
    <paragraph>brooks is planning to take the gmat this spring  leaving time to take it again if necessary before completing applications by the middle of next year  she hopes to stay in atlanta for a part time mba program that would allow her to continue working at her current job  her top choice is emory university s goizueta business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we wish her luck on the gmat and in her application process </paragraph>

  <title>american  british schools draw fewer overseas students  economist reports</title>

    <paragraph>immigration policies in the united states and great britain are making it less appealing for students from other countries to pursue mbas there  even though they are home to some of the best mba programs in the world  according to a report this week in the economist </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in       america educated    percent of the world s mbas  a sharp reduction from the    percent it claimed in       the economist reports  even in absolute terms  the number has shrunken from         to          one of the greatest contributing factors is how difficult it is for students from overseas to obtain a work visa for after graduation  according to the economist  even highly skilled foreigners  like mba graduates  typically wait a decade for a green card </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in britain  meanwhile  students from outside the european union are getting squeezed even more  in its efforts to reduce net immigration  the conservative party has made the application process to receive student visas significantly more difficult  the economist reports  it also has made it much more difficult for non europeans to work in the u k  upon graduation   requiring an immediate sponsoring company and minimum starting salary   and is refusing to allow students to bring their spouses or children with them when they study  enrollment numbers have taken a hit as a result  the economist points out  noting that british business schools were down    percent over the past year according to its own recent mba rankings </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but with their tighter immigration policies  the united states and britain are the ones who stand to suffer  the economist piece argues  the schools lose out on tuition from foreign students  native born students lose out on the valuable opportunity to mix with bright people from elsewhere and truly understand the globalized world  and foreign students are less likely to forge connections that could lead to future business between their home countries and the u s  and u k </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  the economist points out  other countries   including canada  australia and china   are stepping up to welcome the bright students america and britain are turning away  they are doing so by reducing restrictions  undercutting tuition costs and improving standards </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the economist piece closed with this bit of advice   the world is engaged in a war for mobile talent  nations that refuse to take part will lose  the good news is that the most potent weapon costs nothing at all  it is a welcome mat  </paragraph>

  <title>two business school professors receive nobel prize in economics</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last week  a professor of economics and business administration at harvard business school  hbs  and a professor emeritus at the university of california at los angeles  ucla  were named joint winners of the nobel prize in economic sciences  the two were awarded for their theoretical work in market matching and how it can be improved to create better matches  for example  between students and the schools want to attend and between organ donors and recipients </paragraph>
    <paragraph>lloyd shapley of ucla developed a theory of  matching methods  for how to best to match people up in large groups  together with colleague david gale  he developed a process for ensuring that those matches are as stable as possible  which came to be known as the  gale shapley algorithm   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>years later  hbs s alvin roth  now a visiting professor at stanford  developed ways to apply shapley s theory to the admissions process for public schools in new york and boston and used it to match compatible kidney donors with recipients for the new england program for kidney exchange  which he co founded </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the combination of shapley s basic theory and roth s empirical investigations  experiments and practical design has generated a flourishing field of research and improved the performance of many markets   the nobel committee said in its announcement awarding what is formally known as the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the two professors will share      million in prize money from the royal swedish academy of sciences </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit cofounder tapped to moderate graduate management admissions council global symposium panel</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the graduate management admissions council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmat exam and conducts wide ranging research related to graduate management education  recently asked clear admit ceo and cofounder graham richmond to moderate a panel as part of its global symposia  an annual event series in europe and asia designed to give global audiences of admissions professionals insight into current topics and trends in graduate management education </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this year s gmac european conference  held last week in london  spotlighted student motivations and expectations as they relate to graduate management education   specifically with regard to studying in europe during the current financial crisis  the session began with gmac research about candidate motivations   what drives today s applicants to pursue an mba or related master s degree  what their expectations are from the degree and who influences them over the course of the admissions process   presented by michelle sparkman renz  gmac director of research communications  research and development </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the session went on to provide participants with multiple perspectives on the topic  including richmond s own insight as an admissions consultant to prospective applicants to top tier mba programs  as moderator  richmond also posed related questions to a panel of alumni from esade business school  rotterdam school of management  rsm  and cass business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the symposium was really interesting and had attendees from virtually all of the leading institutions in europe  including london business school  london school of economics  esade  ie  imd  hec  oxford  cambridge and rsm   richmond recounts   the way the panel session was constructed allowed gmac s sparkman renz to speak about admissions trends at the macro level  with a focus on europe  and the alumni to speak at the very micro level about their own experiences   i slotted in between those two vantage points offering observations from the clear admit perspective  since we see hundreds of top tier focused candidates each year and have been experts in this space for more than    years  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>gmac will host a similar event next month in singapore  the gmac asia pacific conference  this forum  also focused on candidate motivations and expectations  will take a closer look at how they are shaped by the current global economy and regional economies in asia pacific </paragraph>

  <title>northwestern s kellogg school of management shrinks two year program  increases one year program</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>amid increasing application volume for one year mba programs  chicago area business schools   including northwestern s kellogg school of management   are reallocating resources toward accelerated programs  according to a recent report in crain s chicago business </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applications to kellogg s one year mba jumped by   percent this past year  and the school is increasing its one year class to     from     with plans to add an additional    spots in       crain s reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we ll shrink our two year program roughly in line with the growth of our one year program   betsy ziegler  associate dean of mba programs and dean of students at kellogg  told crain s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the crain s story cited recent figures out of the graduate management admissions council  gmac  showing that    percent of schools offering one year mba programs reported an increase in applications for classes starting in       gmac reports that only    percent of two year programs saw an increase for the same time period </paragraph>
    <paragraph>shorter programs have potential benefits for both students and universities  according to the crain s article  for students  they provide an opportunity to gain expertise without sacrificing two years  salary   and they often come at a reduced price  for example  the one year program at kellogg is          compared to          for the two year mba </paragraph>
    <paragraph>universities  meanwhile  like larger application pools because they can lead to higher quality students  and they can earn more over a two year period if more students come through a shorter program  crain s reports </paragraph>

  <title>u penn s wharton school shares details of new team based discussion admissions component</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>applicants to the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania recently received an email from the admissions office sharing details about a new evaluation method it will use as part of the         application cycle   the team based discussion </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants who are invited to interview will now take part in a team based discussion with five to six other applicants during a scheduled session   our hope is that this will give applicants a glimpse into wharton s group learning dynamic   which is central to our program   read the email   we believe that this type of assessment also serves as a tool to take prospective students  off the page  and allows us to see firsthand the ways in which they can contribute to our community of diverse learners and leaders  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the email  the group discussion  is additive and does not replace the opportunity for an individual exchange   time will be allotted for applicants to have a short one on one conversation regarding their candidacy with the interviewer  during which time they can ask any questions they may have </paragraph>
    <paragraph>who will conduct the group discussions and short one on one conversations will depend upon where a candidate chooses to interview  interviews on campus will be conducted by trained second year students known as admissions fellows  off campus interviews  which will be held this year in dubai  london  mexico city  mumbai  new delhi  san francisco  sao paulo  seoul  shanghai  singapore and tokyo  will be facilitated by admissions staff members </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once a candidate is invited to interview  he or she will be able to schedule an in person session through his or her wharton account   either on campus or in an interview hub city   while there are two options and no one way is preferred over another  we do encourage invited candidates to interview on campus to get a sense of our community and culture   read the email   we will not be able to accommodate all requests for a specific location  so we encourage all invited candidates to register for a slot as soon as possible   it continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of the format of the team based discussion  each will have a prompt and a purpose  and participants are expected to work toward a tangible outcome with their group  the email provided the following examples of prompts that might be used </paragraph>
    <paragraph>  what one talent or strength should a leader rely on most in daily life    if you could teach one thing about innovation to a group of new employees  what would it be </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applicants will receive more detail about the prompt for their discussion after they sign up for an interview session  according to the email </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  the email advised applicants to spend no more than an hour preparing for the discussion  to come prepared to share individual thoughts and not to expect feedback from the interviewer   be careful to avoid any interpretation of verbal or non verbal communication  as both may mislead you   the message cautioned </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck to applicants preparing to take part in this new evaluation method at wharton  remember  the clear admit wiki is a great place to share your first hand experiences with the team based discussion and to learn from those of others </paragraph>

    <paragraph>an article last week in bloomberg businessweek reported on wordprom com  founded by gili and ori elkin  a husband and wife team who graduated with mbas from stanford and haas respectively  in lieu of selling a collection of successful essays compiled as a book  as has been done in the past  the elkins since august have been gathering essays from recent mba graduates and current students and began selling them via their website about two weeks ago  according to bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prospective applicants can search wordprom com s collection by school  gender  graduation year and application round  essays will sell for      though they are being offered at an introductory price of     each  and the first     essay contributors will be paid half that sum whenever one of their essays is downloaded  bloomberg bw reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to ms  elkin  wordprom s ceo  prospective applicants will eventually be able to buy a package of essays at about what it would cost to hire an mba admissions consultant for an hour   i thought it would be a way to make the admissions process accessible to everyone and everywhere   she told bloomberg bw </paragraph>

    <paragraph> i am not a fan  i think it could potentially make candidates inauthentic   rob weiler  anderson s interim assistant dean of mba admissions and financial aid  told bloomberg bw  dean of admissions dee leopold from hbs  meanwhile  questioned the essays  usefulness </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i understand the desire for prospective applicants to get a glimpse of what an hbs essay looks like  that being said  the buyer should really beware   she said   our essay questions are completely new this year  so historical essays may not be as helpful as candidates might wish  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ceo elkin maintains that the essays on wordprom com are intended to be used for inspiration only  noting that users must sign an agreement promising not to plagiarize  violation of the terms of this agreement will result in the user being banned from the wordprom com site </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler featured in article on harvard business school s application changes</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>marking yesterday s round one application deadline at harvard business school  hbs   poets quants today ran an article asking admissions consultants how the applicants they worked with on this year s application to hbs felt about the school s move to reduce its required essays from four to two  according to the p q report  between    and    percent of candidates to harvard are estimated to work with a consultant during their application process  making consultants a good gauge of market reaction to the changes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the majority of admissions consultants polled by p q reported frustration on the part of their clients about the new application format  in which applicants have a total of just     words to answer two direct questions  namely   tell us something you ve done well  and  tell us something you wish you had done better   according to several consultants  applicants felt like the change didn t allow them the opportunity to fully tell their story or  fan out all their feathers  as one put it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit senior admissions counselor stacey oyler had a different view   i think that the clients took the changes in stride   she told p q   after the initial surprise  they focused on sharpening their message and telling their stories with the two essays and their resume  it took some fine tuning  but i think most are happy with the applications they crafted  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs is one of several top business schools that have moved to lessen the role of essays in the application process in recent years  mit sloan school of management and stanford graduate school of business each require fewer essay responses from their applicants this year  and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania this season is rolling out a new group interview portion of the application to provide its admissions committee with an opportunity to see applicants interact with other applicants as part of the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to hbs dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold  the move at hbs comes in part because the essays had become too large a part of the admissions process   i ve been saying that admissions is not an essay writing contest and that is where a lot of the anxiety is   leopold told p q   when we never met anyone  essays were the only way we had for applicants to get some form of personalization of the application  but since the class of       we ve been interviewing all admitted applicants  the interviews are a big investment of our time  money and assessment energy  so i think it s time to have a corresponding reduction in that initial  essay  hurdle  </paragraph>

    <paragraph> there is greater demand that business schools today offer specialized and flexible programs to meet corporate and student needs   gmac president and ceo david wilson said in a statement   worldwide  these diverse graduate management programs are drawing different kinds of students   he continued  adding that technology has helped some schools meet increasingly varied demand  as has flexibility in delivery mode   the message students and companies are sending is clear  one size does not necessarily fit all   wilson added </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit s stacey oyler featured in article on business school admissions staffers turned admissions consultants</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stacey oyler  a senior admissions counselor here at clear admit who came to us from the admissions office at dartmouth s tuck school of business  was recently featured prominently in a poets quants article about that very topic   namely  former admissions committee members at top mba programs who become admissions consultants to prospective mba applicants  the article ran today on the p q website  as well as on the cnn money and fortune websites </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the article indicates  oyler worked on the tuck admissions committee for two years  from october      to july       participating in every admissions decision for two full classes as part of a process that involved reviewing applications in a locked room with seven colleagues until they reached unanimous decisions of whether to admit  deny or waitlist  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you got a little crazy locked in that room   oyler laughingly told p q   i remember we had a major debate over whether a military candidate actually flew a plane or was merely on the plane  you couldn t tell for sure from his application   in the end  they picked up the phone and called the applicant to find out </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after her tenure at tuck  oyler spent another three years as an mba recruiter for mckinsey   co  before joining clear admit  those combined experiences make her a valuable asset to our admissions consultant team  both for applicants who seek her first hand knowledge of tuck s mba program and admissions process as well as for those who simply want help from a passionate and talented professional in the field </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i know people think i went to the dark side when i became a consultant   oyler told p q   but i don t do this for the money  i like working with people  i m just a coach  but i love what i do  it s fun  and i m not cheating  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>indeed  as the article goes on to point out  oyler is one of dozens of former admissions officials who have transitioned to the role of consultant  in addition to oyler  with her tuck background  clear admit s team also includes consultants with experience working in the admissions offices of the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and the university of chicago booth school of business  among others </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while the piece rightly suggests that an admissions stint isn t a requirement for being a top notch admissions consultant  here at clear admit we are pleased that oyler s experience complements that of our other team members and vice versa </paragraph>

  <title>admissions insiders advise prospective mba applicants to ask their own questions during the interview</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in preparing for the questions they may be asked as part of an mba admissions interview  prospective applicants would do well to formulate a few intelligent questions of their own  according to admissions deans from top mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the questions that an mba candidate asks as part of the interview can make the difference that leads to an acceptance letter  according to a recent column in u s  news by dr  don martin  a former admissions dean at columbia  northwestern and the university of chicago booth school of business  among other schools  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>christine sneva  director of admissions and financial aid at cornell university s johnson school of management  agreed with martin s thesis   it s a chance for candidates to show they ve made the effort to dig a little deeper  that they care and have genuine interest in our program and faculty research   sneva told him </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at johnson  where students are encouraged to develop relationships with faculty  sneva is particularly impressed when prospective applicants pose questions that reflect the fact that they have taken time to identify the research and teaching of individual professors  but even simple questions can make a good impression  she adds </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i like it when a candidate asks about the facilities such as the library  student center and academic buildings   she told martin   it seems simple  but it shows that the candidate is picturing his or herself here  and that s important to us  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his column  martin revealed that while an admissions dean  he regularly sought feedback from interviewers about the types of questions applicants asked   it provided insight into what the candidate was thinking and what is important to him or her about an mba education   he writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martin goes on to recommend five types of questions candidates should ask  first  ask a question based on something you read in a brochure or on the school website  he suggests   this demonstrates due diligence and indicates time well spent researching that mba program   he writes  second  ask why the interviewer decided to become part of the respective school   whether it s a student  alumnus or admissions staff representative  this is a great way to engage your interviewer and seek firsthand knowledge of what makes the school special   he advises </paragraph>
    <paragraph>martin s other suggested questions include what the interviewer considers to be the school or program s greatest asset  what three adjectives he or she would use to describe the school and what advice the interviewer might have to offer   this may be the most important question to ask   martin says  noting that it s also a good closing question   don t hesitate to ask the interviewer for the one piece of advice he or she would give you as a student at that school   he adds  in doing so  you are tapping into the experience and insight of someone who knows the mba program well while also demonstrating openness to feedback </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business admissions office won t focus on integrated reasoning gmat scores until next year</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the launch of the new integrated reasoning  ir  section of the graduate management admissions test  gmat  should not be a cause of worry for prospective mba applicants  according to a recent post on the stanford mba admissions blog  the admissions team there doesn t plan to focus on scores for the new section until it has had more of a chance to determine how to evaluate them </paragraph>
    <paragraph> rest assured that ir is new to us  too  and it s going to take us  and our peer schools  some time before we know how to interpret it as it relates to the stanford mba program   writes stanford associate director of mba admissions allison davis   what we do know is that the test was designed to provide insight into how you pull together knowledge from different sources something you probably do already at work  and will certainly do here at stanford  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for this application year  stanford mba admissions will see your ir score if you have taken the new gmat  but they will focus on the verbal  quantitative  awa and total scores  according to davis   once we have had the chance to review ir scores in this first year  we will determine how to evaluate them in our process for next year   she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>davis went on to remind prospective applicants that no one score or section of a test is decisive in the stanford mba admissions process  the school has no cut offs and requires no minimum or maximum score   we look for indicators of your academic ability throughout your whole application  and a test score is only one data point in a much larger picture   says davis </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she added that prospective applicants who have not taken the new gmat also shouldn t worry   scores from the earlier test are valid for   years and her team doesn t have a preference about when you take your test   and we accept both the gmat and the gre  and we don t play favorites    she states </paragraph>

  <title>current chicago booth student provides pointers for prospective applicants attending admissions events</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a recent article in bloomberg businessweek suggests that more top u s  business schools are sending their admissions teams out on the road to more cities across the country in an effort to combat flagging applicant volume  but just as they provide important recruiting opportunities for schools  admissions events also give prospective applicants a valuable means of getting to know more about programs they are interested in while obtaining a first hand impression of the people and culture that make each school unique </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a current student at the university of chicago booth school of business who has worked with that school s admissions office since matriculating suggests that prospective applicants shouldn t worry too much about how they are being evaluated during these events   as a student who has been very involved with admissions events for the past year  i now know that these events are for you  the prospective students   wrote beth mcnamee in a recent post to the booth experience student blog   we want to give you a chance to get to know the school  ask questions and figure out if booth is the right fit for you  the best thing you can do is relax  learn  enjoy the free food and yourself   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in her post  mcnamee revealed that she was so nervous attending her first admissions event that she almost missed it entirely  after several minutes of small talk with two friendly women at the bar where the event was supposed to take place  she asked if they had just finished their first year  only to be met with blank stares   turns out  they were just two random friendly young women at the bar  in my nervousness  i had not even made it to the event  which was just across the room   mcnamee said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>her greatest regret looking back at the application process was not having more fun during this part of it  to prospective applicants just getting started she made some useful suggestions  for one  make some notes after the event of things that were interesting and relevant to you   they could be subjects to discuss with your interviewer  second  if you connect with someone during the event  don t hesitate to ask for their email and follow up   generally  i find that students and alumni are happy to talk offline   she wrote   i m even meeting up this weekend with an alum i met during the application process  </paragraph>

  <title>one year mba  two year mba  pros and cons</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>preference for one year mba programs   common at european business schools  but traditionally less so at u s  schools   is growing among prospective u s  and canadian applicants  according to an article this week in the wall street journal  lean economic times make the benefits of shorter programs  including lower tuition and less time and earnings lost while studying  appealing  but the wsj article argues that these accelerated options may carry other costs that students considering them should bear in mind </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in          percent of u s  and canadian respondents to a survey by business education research company qs quacquarelli symonds ltd  preferred programs lasting    to    months  the wsj reports  this year  that figure fell to    percent  meanwhile  preference for programs lasting between    and    months rose  up to    percent of respondents from    percent in       some u s  schools are responding to this increased demand  such as northwestern s kellogg school of management  which announced earlier this year that it plans to double the size of its one year option   check out our admissions director q a with kellogg s kate smith for more on this  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other schools believe that the drawbacks of one year mba programs outweigh their benefits  according to the wsj report   thinking that you can learn all the basics of management in just one year is simply impossible   jordi canals  dean at university of navarra s iese business school in spain  told the wsj  he maintains that it takes at least seven or eight months just to learn the fundamentals of business  iese offers only a two year program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kellogg requires students in its one year mba program to come in having already studied fundamental business courses so that they are ready for higher level courses  electives and club activities  betsy ziegler  kellogg associate dean of mba programs and dean of students  told the wsj </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but that doesn t address the issue of the summer internship  an integral part of two year mbas  the wsj article points out  many top firms make the majority of their associate hires through their internship programs  leaving students in one year mba programs at a significant disadvantage </paragraph>

  <title>the evolving relationship between admissions consultants and business school admissions officers</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit co founder graham richmond was featured in a bloomberg businessweek article this week about the relationship between mba admissions consultants and top business schools  though the article quotes some school officials who say they are wary of consultants who may  help too much   it does point to efforts by reputable admissions consultants such as clear admit to promote ethical standards and protocols in the admissions consulting process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  clear admit s richmond was a founding member six years ago of the association of international graduate admissions consultants  aigac   which requires members to adhere to a set of principles for good practice  and he sees a clear trend toward stronger and stronger relationships between admissions consultants and top business programs  as evidenced by the growing number of schools that have hosted aigac conferences on their campuses  those schools   which total    to date   include the kellogg school of management  aigac conference        columbia business school  aigac conference        harvard business school  aigac conference       and the mit sloan school of management  aigac conference        just to name a few  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  representatives from more    schools have attended and or participated in aigac panel discussions and other events  and as richmond pointed out in the bloomberg bw piece  more and more admissions directors are giving interviews to clear admit and other consultancies than was the case a decade ago  we will feature interviews with admissions directors at more than two dozen top schools as part of our current admissions director q a series  which we will be releasing over the course of the next two months </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i am not suggesting that these programs all  recommend  that applicants use an admissions consultant   richmond says   having said that  the fact that they have all opened up their campuses to aigac conferences and or traveled to our events to serve on panels suggests that they recognize the need to work with us and are seeking open lines of communication   he continued  he also noted that top programs also recognize that aigac consultants reach tens of thousands of top tier applicants each year  representing a valuable marketing channel </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so though some may still characterize the relationship between admissions consultants and business schools as chilly  those of us here at clear admit  take heart in knowing that admissions directors at top programs increasingly recognize the valuable role ethical consultants can play for prospective applicants as part of the admissions process </paragraph>

  <title>clear admit featured in financial times article on changing mba admissions</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit s own graham richmond was featured as part of an article this week in the financial times about changes taking place this admissions season at several top business schools  the article  entitled  the creative route to an mba   highlighted the shift at several top mba programs toward requiring fewer essays from applicants  among other changes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several top schools  including harvard business school  hbs   stanford graduate school of business and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania  will require applicants to submit fewer essays as part of the application process than in years past  clear admit s richmond told the ft that he believes this is part of a trend by top programs to shift emphasis away from the essays and toward the interview portion of the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>admissions directors at hbs and stanford acknowledge declined emphasis on the essay portion of the application process   i think and i ve said this before  this isn t an essay writing contest   hbs managing director for admissions dee leopold told the ft  derrick bolton  mba admissions director at stanford  thinks a shift toward fewer essays is just the beginning   schools are finally beginning to catch up with the world around them  i think you ll see a lot more changes in the next four or five years   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to richmond s point that schools are putting greater emphasis instead on the interview  hbs this year will invite candidates who interview to submit a memo reflecting on that interview within    hours  wharton  meanwhile  will introduce a group interview for the first time </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the ft report  school officials maintain that the changes are designed to better match generation y applicants  though there is some speculation that they may also be part of an effort to combat the application volume drop off that many schools have seen in recent years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the application process may not be the only aspect of the mba program to face change  though some top schools argue that a one year mba degree isn t sufficient to cover the required curriculum and lacks the important summer internship  other schools have begun to recognize that application volume among one year programs is on the rise  kellogg  one of the few top u s  programs that has both one  and two year programs  reports that applications to the one year program have increased by    to    percent over the past two years  while those to the two year program have fallen by almost as much  according to the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in this economy  where candidates are a bit more roi conscious  they may think a one year program is enough for what they need   richmond told the ft </paragraph>

  <title>business schools fail to track whether social networking yields applicants  survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>though the overwhelming majority of top business schools use social networks like twitter  facebook and linkedin to promote their programs  far fewer actually follow through to determine which social media interactions yield applications  according to a recent university of massachusetts dartmouth study </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the study found that a whopping    percent of the    surveyed business schools promote themselves on twitter  and    percent do so on linkedin  u s  news reports  but of those schools  which were selected for their top u s  news rankings     percent don t track whether social media interactions actually yield applications  the survey found  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> they are heavily involved in social media and they think they re doing a hell of a job  and in reality they re not ever tracking these people these thousands and thousands of people coming to their facebook page   to see if they become applicants   nora ganim barnes  director of umass dartmouth s center for marketing research  told u s  news  barnes  who conducted the study with stephanie jacobsen  the former mba coordinator at the university s charlton college of business  called the findings a  wake up call  for business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>business school applicants  meanwhile  should look at social media interactions as a means of collecting information about schools  but not as a way to improve their chances of admissions  sarah ramsey  director of mba recruitment and admissions at the university of california at irvine s merage school of business  told u s  news  the school doesn t formally account for those types of interactions  she says   but candidates are being observed  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the umass dartmouth study did find that schools value social networking  with    percent maintaining an official mba blog and    percent reporting plans to invest more in social media in the next year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>even if it can t increase your chances of getting in  umass s barnes recommends using the portals as a means of networking before getting to campus   once you get there to be able to say   hi i m charlie  we had that discussion   i think it opens doors   she told u s  news </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>late last week  wharton vice dean karl t  ulrich reported that wharton would adopt a team based discussion as part of its           application process   this new method of applicant evaluation was piloted during round   of the previous admissions cycle and with current mba students at the wharton school last year  it will be an addition to the current one on one interview  not a replacement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to ulrich s official announcement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>while this is interview format is new to wharton  imd business school in switzerland has had a group case study component in its admissions process for some time   the key difference is that each year imd welcomes    students to campus to participate in its one year mba program  while wharton boasts classes of      for its two year program </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>mba students at new york university s stern school of business increasingly are taking advantage of opportunities to travel the globe and put some of the things they are learning into practice to shape social policy  according to a recent article in the financial times </paragraph>
    <paragraph>more than     stern students participated in the stern consulting corps  scc  program this past year  and applications to the scc program rose     percent this spring compared with last year  the ft reports  scc began    years ago as a program placing students with local non profits for    week project engagements  this year  for the first time  the program expanded to include projects in emerging markets linked to faculty research </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one such project involved a dozen mba students traveling to india to work with arun sundararajan  stern associate professor of information  operations and management sciences  to analyze the impact of india s unique identity project  a government sponsored initiative to help provide every indian citizen with a unique    digit id number  without some form of identification  much of india s population cannot apply for bank accounts  obtain mobile phones or receive government subsidies for food and education  among other things </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s a moon shot project   sundararajan told the ft    it s having a transformative impact on the lives of hundreds of millions of people   he added  noting that about     million citizens who did not have a portable id will have one by the end of the year  participation provides stern students with an opportunity to understand in tangible ways the power business has to transform society  according to sundararajan   it s one thing to be exposed to examples of this in a textbook  it s another to witness it first hand   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  other stern scc students have been in honduras working with professor paul romer  who heads stern s urbanization project  to develop a business plan for a new city now being developed  these students spent the semester coming up with population growth models and potential financial rules and regulations  as well as working up infrastructure estimates and writing policy briefs  according to the ft report  romer presented some of the findings to octavio sanchez  chief of staff to the honduran president </paragraph>

  <title>admissions tip  using rankings to your advantage</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>there are numerous sources that can knowledgeably rank the  top  mba programs   however  because business schools receive different rankings depending on the sources  criteria  it can be difficult to understand which are the  best  schools   therefore today we d like to talk about how b school applicants can use rankings to discover the  best  schools for them   although the general merits of each school are important  we also believe that it is important for mba applicants to rank schools based on their individual needs and interests   therefore we encourage students to use official mba school rankings in the following ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   use rankings to create a consensus   sources rarely have the exact same rankings as each other  and therefore trying to determine the  top five  schools can be frustrating   however  it s best to compile these different sources of rankings to form a consensus regarding the top schools   for example  if your target program is consistently listed in the top     regardless of its individual ranking among different sources  you should feel confident that it is regarded as a top school by industry professionals and future employers   you may not be able to pinpoint the ultimate  number one  school  but you will be able to distinguish between the different tiers of schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   consider individual rankings   mba applicants should assess schools based on how they will help them gain what they want from their business school experiences   therefore we urge you to ask yourself what matters most to you in an mba program   some applicants may value strict adherence to the case method more than the amount or size of research centers  whereas other applicants may want a large number of diverse student organizations or a strong joint degree program   looking at the individual criteria from which rankings are calculated may help you judge business schools based on the specific factors that matter most to you   for example  if you are interested in entrepreneurship  then perhaps you should consider applying to an mba program with a strong program in this field  even if it receives lower scores in other areas especially if these areas are not a main concern for you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>    think about where you want to go after business school   in addition to considering what you want to get out of your business school experience  you should think about how business school will help you pursue your future career   therefore  some important rankings to consider may be the number of internships students gain at a particular mba program or how many recruiters from different fields visit specific campuses   these rankings may be especially important if you need to follow a specific career path to achieve your career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to studying rankings  we encourage b school applicants to do further research in understanding the comparable merits of business schools  such as perusing admissions information  talking to professors and students  and visiting campuses   furthermore  we encourage applicants to check out our clear admit school guides  which offer detailed profiles of the leading mba programs   best of luck to those researching business schools </paragraph>

  <title>forte foundation extends initiative to increase women on corporate boards</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this summer  the forte foundation extended to the united states an initiative originally launched in europe to increase the number of women serving on corporate boards   qualified board ready women do exist  and we are using our unique relationship with u s  business schools to make these accomplished individuals visible to decision makers   elissa ellis sangster  forte executive director  said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in late june  forte   a consortium of corporations  business schools and nonprofits focused on directing talented women toward positions of leadership in business   asked each of its    u s  mba partner schools to supply at least five board ready women  an earlier collaboration between forte  its five european business school members and the european commission yielded a repository of       vetted and board ready women culled from school alumnae  faculty and staff members </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the success of the european initiative inspired forte to expand its call for board ready women to the united states  forte plans to release a separate list of u s  based board ready women at the end of this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as the european schools have done  u s  member schools will identify a point of contact to reach out to the full list of board ready women from each institution  forte also will consider self nominations from its membership of        professional women </paragraph>
    <paragraph> as the only organization that unites top business schools around the topic of women in business  we consider it our responsibility to take concrete steps to promote gender parity in corporate boardrooms   sangster said in a statement  forte announced the expansion of the initiative to the united states at its annual sponsor meeting in los angeles on june   th  the event included a panel entitled   corporate boards  where are the women  </paragraph>

  <title>former insead dean shares his plans for cambridge s judge business school</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>last year  the former dean of insead s phd program left that school to become director of the judge business school at the university of cambridge  in an interview published this week in the financial times  christoph loch talks about the differences between the schools and his hopes and plans in his new role at judge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>german born loch told the ft that he thinks that the    year old judge business school is about two thirds of the way towards becoming an institution that will truly rival the ivy leagues   the rule of thumb is that it takes    years to build a top business school   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>judge currently has    faculty  and loch has a goal of growing that to    in the medium term  he does not have aspirations to transform judge into an insead  with campuses in three different parts of the world      faculty and       students per class  he told the ft   the biggest business schools are not necessarily the best   he said   we will never have       mbas  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  it was the many ways in which judge is different from insead that attracted him to his new position  he says   part of the reason i came is that you can do things as part of a great university that a stand alone business school cannot do   he told the ft   we need to build on those  university  assets  the strategy is simply different from a standalone school  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>over the course of the next    years  loch hopes to build a research based school focused around the  cambridge phenomenon    the cluster of high tech start ups that have become part of the university town  a tech specialist himself  he hopes to work with organizations within that cluster to help judge develop its research acumen   specifically by investigating issues that are important to the high tech companies themselves </paragraph>

  <title>words of wisdom from business school deans and directors</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an article this week in forbes compiled messages given to the graduating business school class of      by deans and directors at some of the top mba programs  including harvard business school  uva s darden school of business  nyu stern  dartmouth s tuck school of business and more </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not surprisingly  there were some recurrent themes  among them  be yourself  be accountable  try to help others and society </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a couple of deans advised graduates to think about how they want others to remember them   i d suggest that you think about the stories other people will tell about you   hbs dean nitin nohria offered   are you acting entitled  are you using power in a way that benefits those who have less of it  or  rather  are you conducting yourself with the kind of grace that will leave the people you encounter so impressed that they will continue to tell wonderful stories about you years after an encounter   nick barniville  mba program director at esmt  gave similar advice   think of how you would like to be remembered and work backwards   he said   try to create something of lasting value  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>still other deans stuck to more purely practical advice  sleep is overrated  james g  ellis  dean of the marshall school of business at usc  told graduates   always say yes when invited to join friends acquaintances for dinner  say yes   he encouraged   you never know who you will meet  and you will build your own network  you can sleep when you die  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>esmt s barniville added   don t talk with chewing gum in your mouth  and try not to use words your mum wouldn t understand  don t be a bore  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>and philippe oster  mba admissions director at hec paris  spoke specifically to the hazards and opportunities presented by social media   use social media with social grace   he recommended   such online platforms are likely to play an ever greater role in your professional life  but remember to go beyond the formulaic and standardized messages that linkedin and others have written for you   he said   after all  would you approach somebody at a dinner party or a conference and say by way of introduction  i would like to add you to my professional network   </paragraph>

    <paragraph>hbs has not set a word limit on applicants  replies to this question  and leopold stressed that the exercise is not another essay   we want your response to be much more like an email   she writes  the hope behind this new element of the hbs application process is to give applicants an opportunity to interact with the hbs admissions staff in more of a real world scenario than traditional application elements have offered </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in the real world  it is unlikely that you will be given months and months to craft essays of any sort  it just doesn t happen   writes leopold   in the real world  it is almost a sure thing that you will be asked to write emails summarizing meetings and giving your opinion in a short time frame   she continues  noting that hbs tries to be as  close to practice  as possible  leopold calls this shift from essays to more real time writing appropriate </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold s blog post comes in response to multiple inquiries from prospective applicants seemingly distraught over the    hour deadline on the new interview reflection email   i know this is hard to hear but this should not be a cause for anxiety   leopold stresses  hbs is simply looking for applicants  genuine reaction to the interview experience  in fact  leopold says  her team will even be much more generous in its reaction to typos and grammatical errors in this element of the application than in others </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that said  her team will not be pleased if an applicant s email seems like it was produced before the interview or was the result of significant coaching  editing or polishing   we do not expect you to solicit or receive any outside assistance with this exercise   she writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so there you have it </paragraph>

  <title>tuck alumnus endows new energy professorship  initiative</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a tuck school of business alumnus and energy industry executive has endowed a new professorship and energy initiative devoted to helping tuck students explore the business of finding  delivering and selling energy  the school announced this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>daniel revers  co founder of energy investment firm arclight capital partners  has worked in the energy industry since graduating from tuck in       he began on the industry side  working for wheelabrator technologies  and then moved to john hancock to work on the investment side  in       he founded arclight in boston with robb e  turner  and since then they have opened offices in new york  barcelona and luxembourg and grown to manage more than     billion in five funds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>his gift to tuck will endow the revers professorship of business administration and the revers energy initiative fund  tuck senior associate dean robert hansen has begun the search for a faculty member to fill the professorship position and envisions an energy economist who will teach an overview course and a specialized elective and create student focused activities such as workshops  conferences and networking opportunities  tuck expects the search for a professor to take at least a year  but the energy initiative will get underway in the meantime  offering programming starting this fall </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there is really nothing out there like this   says revers   and if there s any place that can take on something like this and produce something of value  it s tuck  the scale of the school is right to create customized programs and build the effort incrementally  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>revers  who has also served as a tuck overseer and funded the revers board fellows program and a faculty fellow  was motivated by two main factors in making this most recent gift to tuck  the first was the collaborative spirit of tuck s new master of health care delivery science program   the mhcds program is proof that the deans are willing to push the envelope to keep tuck on top today and to make sure tuck is on top five to    years down the road as well   he said   i think it s also a good example of how the different schools at the college can work together   he added  noting that similar collaboration between tuck and thayer and the dartmouth energy collaborative would make an energy initiative even better </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the surprising lack of mba talent in the energy industry was a second motivating factor for revers   the big companies in energy do not have the talent to assess and take advantage of this new market paradigm   revers said  referring to de regulation of the industry that has led to more complex  global  sophisticated markets   mbas with a general management education can apply their skills to unlocking the value in today s volatile energy market   he said </paragraph>

  <title>uva s darden school dean joins call for reinstatement of university president</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>darden school dean bob bruner joined the deans of several other schools at the university of virginia  uva  in issuing a statement yesterday to the board of visitors  bov  of the university and the media calling for the reinstatement of university president teresa sullivan  the bov unexpectedly announced on june   th that sullivan would step down after just two years in her post as president  inciting an immediate and passionate response from the university community representing strong opinions on all sides </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the wall street journal incorrectly reported that bruner was the only dean of uva s    schools not to sign the statement  leading bruner to post the following to his dean s blog on friday   yesterday afternoon  the deans of the various divisions of uva issued the following statement to the board of visitors of the university of virginia and to the media  the statement itself identified none of the co authors  i participated in preparing this statement and lend my support to it  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>together  the deans of the schools are calling for the reinstatement of sullivan and her team so that they can address  rapidly  thoughtfully  and in a collegial but urgent fashion  the fiscal challenges that face the public institution in the midst of reduced alumni giving and a near    percent reduction in state aid  the bov asked sullivan to step down for not instituting quickly enough sweeping changes to how the university is run  sullivan has said that she sought to take a more  incrementalist  approach  and protesters against her ouster have reacted to the bov s mandate as corporate style  top down management that violates the goals of a public institution  which should be based on open discourse and a sense of joint ownership and responsibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the bov is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow to reconsider sullivan s dismissal  sullivan has said that she will return on the condition that the board instead fires board chairperson helen dragas </paragraph>

  <title>four trends to watch in business school education</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>an article this week in mashable  a leading source for news on digital innovation  highlighted four key trends to watch in graduate management education  the rise of entrepreneurship  a focus on collaborative management  required ethics and sustainability training and continued emphasis on increasing diversity among business school classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in terms of entrepreneurship  the mashable article notes that mbas increasingly are forgoing more traditional careers in finance and banking to instead begin their own companies   the u s  is in a really exciting time because of this entrepreneurship bug that is spreading like the new version of the industrial revolution   brain meece  co founder of crowdfunding website rockethub  told mashable </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as a result  silicon valley is proving more of a draw than wall street  with a recent report showing that financial institutions are hiring even fewer people than they did during the first three quarters of       schools like spain s esade are also seeing recruiters look for greater entrepreneurial skills in prospective hires  mashable reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a shift toward teaching more collaborative models of management  too  is underway at schools like the stanford graduate school of business and france s hec  mashable reports  stanford  for its part  has taken steps to make collaboration a key part of its teaching and culture  hec  meanwhile  announced in february that it is launching a formal teaching partnership with google and will bring in digital entrepreneurs and google employees for a series of educational events </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the third trend  toward emphasis on ethics and sustainability as part of a business school education  has been widely observed in response to the      financial crisis and scandals like enron  mashable notes  a      survey by the aspen institute found that    percent of schools require a course in ethics or a related topic  up from only    percent in       student demand  in part  has driven this shift  according to stephanie ta  community manager for topmbaconnect com  a community website of prospective mba students   green mbas and social good are trends among the population of young professionals i serve   she told mashable   much of this is thanks to social media which has changed our behavior and what we expect from companies  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the fourth and final trend cited in the mashable piece is a move toward greater diversity among incoming business school classes  today  business schools are not only attempting to attract more women  minority and international students  but they are also launching cross disciplinary mbas and narrowly focused recruiting initiatives to help draw individuals who may not fit the traditional business school mold </paragraph>

  <title>ucla anderson moves closer to self supporting funding model</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph></paragraph>
    <paragraph>the anderson school of management at the university of california at los angeles  ucla  moved one step closer to converting its mba program from state supported to self supported  the school announced last week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>on june  th  the legislative assembly of the ucla academic senate approved a proposal to forgo state funding by a vote of    to     the proposal now goes to the academic senate for the entire university of california and to uc president mark yudof  who has the final say </paragraph>
    <paragraph>if the proposal wins final approval  the anderson school will become the first mainstream uc program to rely solely on tuition and donations  it would join other business schools at top public institutions  such the university of virginia s darden school of business and university of michigan s ross school of business  which have also state cut funding ties in recent years </paragraph>
    <paragraph> our proposal is a response to the urgent need to find solutions to campus wide financial challenges   judy olian  dean of ucla anderson  said in a statement  anderson faces dramatic cuts in state funding  and the new self supporting funding model would give the school the authority to control tuition increases  have greater say in faculty hiring and make enhancements to its mba program </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are in a different era now  and unfortunately we are in a public higher education system that is under real stress   olian told bloomberg businessweek    we have to think of innovative solutions  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the school would take steps to make its program more streamlined and efficient as well as rely on alumni gifts in order to offset the loss of state funding  olian told bloomberg bw that alumni have already pledged     million in gifts to the school on the condition that the program become self sufficient </paragraph>
    <paragraph>under the anderson proposal  state support that otherwise would flow to ucla anderson would instead be available to the ucla campus for other programs that have also been hit by tough state budget cuts  campus budget officials estimate that the net financial gain to the campus would be      million annually </paragraph>

  <title>gmac launches new gmat featuring integrated reasoning section</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning today  the graduate management admissions text  gmat  used as part of the admissions process for business school will feature a new integrated reasoning section in which test takers will be asked to demonstrate their ability to use integrated reasoning to evaluate information from various sources and formats such as graphs  charts  tables and spreadsheets </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the graduate management admissions council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmac  began development of the new section two years ago in response to feedback from business school faculty from around the world about what emerging skill sets are increasingly critical to success in business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the strength of the new integrated reasoning section and the gmat exam as a whole lies in our unique position to respond to the specific needs of business schools and employers   dave wilson  president and ceo of gmac  said in a statement   the information age is demanding a new set of skills that require the integration of verbal and quantitative abilities to analyze different types of data from various sources  the new section on the gmat measures these skills  which have become essential for success in the classroom and in the business world   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new integrated reasoning section introduces innovative question types designed to measure test takers  data analysis skills as they evaluate information from a range of sources  rich lyons  dean of the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley  hopes the new section will make it easier to spot leadership potential   the integrated reasoning section will make us better at identifying it   he said in a statement   this type of reasoning is an important input to innovative leadership  which our businesses and societies need more than ever  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to gmac s      corporate recruiters survey  corporate recruiters are looking for the same skills  of       corporate recruiters representing more than     companies in    countries worldwide  more than    percent of respondents said that integrated reasoning skills were important in new hires  gmac reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new    minute integrated reasoning section will not change the length of the gmat exam  instead  it will replace one of two    minute analytical writing essay questions on the previous version of the test  leaving the test at its current length of     hours  a test taker s total gmat score is still based on performance on the verbal and quantitative sections  on a         scale   and the integrated reasoning section  like the analytical writing assessment  is scored separately  gmac reports </paragraph>

  <title>surge of small firms recruit mbas  wall street journal reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the economic crisis of four years ago has had an unexpected if delayed positive impact on recruiting at several top business schools  according to a report this week in the wall street journal  wsj   in a bid to secure jobs for their graduates when large corporations halted recruiting  career services at top schools began reaching out to small firms for the first time  now  even as larger firms return to former recruiting levels  lots of smaller companies are on campuses to stay as well </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the downturn really forced the field of  business school recruiters  to diversify   nicole hall  president of the mba career services council  an association of business school career offices  told the wsj </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to a      survey by the career services council     percent of schools said they saw an increase in recruiting from small firms of     people or fewer  mit s sloan school of management invited small businesses to participate in a career fair during the last semester of the mba program  after traditional fall recruiting  sue kline  sloan s director of career development  told the wsj </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  the career center has started developing relationships with companies of     employees or fewer with a particular focus on start ups  this according to maria halpern  a senior associate director in mba career management at the philadelphia school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it means more prospects for mba students   especially as larger firms return to recruiting levels of the past  and for small companies it means the opportunity to land hires with strong skills gained at top schools who they wouldn t otherwise be able to lure </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but even with a struggling economy and a tight job market  lots of mbas are still reluctant to work for smaller  lesser known firms with smaller salaries and fewer perks </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the environment is proving to be a little scary for kids to come in and not have a big  fat paycheck   christine ingraham  owner of box kitchen  a guilford  conn   maker of modular kitchen cabinets  told the wsj  she recruited at sloan last spring but after interviewing a handful of candidates the one offer she made was declined  nonetheless  she plans to return to sloan to recruit as business expands  she says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to draw top candidates who might otherwise try to hold out for larger paychecks at large firms  smaller companies are stressing their flexible roles and relaxed atmospheres  an approach that is working for some  according to the wsj </paragraph>

  <title>stanford gsb dean discusses teaching innovation  creativity</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a recent interview with the wall street journal  stanford graduate school of business  gsb  dean garth saloner explains how he thinks innovation is a skill that can be taught  his thinking is informed by several years he took off from teaching at stanford to serve as an advisor to silicon valley startups  it s a belief he feels fervently enough to have overhauled the school s curriculum to include more teaching of innovation in core classes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to saloner  who took over as stanford gsb dean in       innovation requires people to be  change agents  who use a mix of leadership  analytical and management skills   all of which he believes can be taught </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we think we re providing students with the ability to tackle the big problems   he told the wsj  as the wsj article points out  many prospective students are clamoring to take part in the revamped curriculum focused on teaching innovation  last year        applicants applied for a class that wound up including just     students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in the wsj interview published this week  south africa native saloner answered questions ranging from whether things like innovation and creativity can really be taught to how stanford gsb in particular sets out to teach personal leadership skills </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some key excerpts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>saloner on how to teach creativity   here we draw heavily from design elements from our design school   he told the wsj    being creative  starts with customer empathy and talking to them and understanding their perspective  get out of the analytical armchair and go and talk to the person whose situation you re trying to address  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>saloner on proof that teaching innovation is working   one example is the story of embrace  it was a multidisciplinary team  of students  from the business school  medical school and engineering school  they went to a rural village in nepal and found out that    million low birth weight babies are born a year  world wide  and that four million die a year and that s essentially because they don t have baby incubators  that s a real problem  so you come back here and ask what do we do about it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>long story short  they invented a baby sleeping bag that in the back has this material  that can be warmed up   parents can throw it into boiling water and bring it up to a desired temperature and slip it back into the bag and it is a fully functional baby warmer  and they ve gone out as a company  </paragraph>

  <title>new generation gmat debuts soon  driven in part by rising numbers of chinese  indian test takers</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the new york times  nyt  this week discussed the new graduate management admissions test  gmat   how it differs from the previous test  what motivated some of the changes  how it compares to the graduate record examination  gre   and what steps test administrators are taking to prevent cheating and fraud </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beginning in june  the gmat will feature four parts instead of the traditional three  in addition to sections testing verbal skills  math skills and analytic writing ability  the next generation exam will also feature a section devoted to testing integrated reasoning  this new section  which will challenge test takers to understand and synthesize data from multiple sources as means of predicting probable outcomes  was added in part to help safeguard against cheating  according to the nyt article  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the nyt article acknowledged that the newly designed gmat comes as the proportion of test takers from mainland china is experiencing rapid growth  part of a trend dating back about five years  in       just over       chinese citizens or residents  or roughly   percent of the total  took the exam  compared to        in       the nyt reports  figures could reach        next year  representing    percent of overall test takers   these figures do not take into account thousands of test takers from hong kong and taiwan  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>india  too  is seeing a rapid number of new applicants  in      there were        applications  according to nyt article   schools around the world are seeing this coming into their pipelines   alex chisholm  of the graduate management admission council  gmac   which develops and administers the gmat  said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ashok sarathy  gmac s vice president in charge of the testing program  noted that the gmat exam has in fact been in  continuous evolution  since its february      introduction by nine business schools  including harvard business school  columbia business school  the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania and northwestern s kellogg school of management </paragraph>
    <paragraph>changes have included the addition of a section on data sufficiency in the early     s and the swap out of a section on antonyms and analogies in place of an added section on reading comprehension in the     s  and in       they added an analytical writing ability component  sarathy continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sarathy went on to add that this newest section on integrated reasoning comes in to respond from business schools  asking for a way to evaluate a new set of skills  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we did a survey of more than     faculty from schools all over the world   he told the nyt   as a result  we developed a set of questions aimed at testing the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources in order to solve complex problems  they also wanted candidates to be able to indicate what information was relevant  and not relevant  and to be able to evaluate which among a set of possible outcomes were the most likely  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in a globally competitive world  the ability to analyze data presented in different formats   for example  in tabular or graphical form  or in written summary   and to then identify where you might find a competitive advantage becomes increasingly important    sarathy added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new section will take    minutes to complete and replaces the essay writing component of the analytical writing portion  leaving the total test time unchanged at three and a half hours  or four hours including breaks </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley s haas school to launch new digital courses</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley this summer plans to leap online with the introduction of three pilot digital courses that will make use of cutting edge technology to teach students outside of the traditional classroom  one class is a prerequisite for the school s evening   weekend mba program  another is a popular mba elective for both fulltime and evening and weekend students and the third is an undergraduate course </paragraph>
    <paragraph> digital education is revolutionizing how we teach  including our traditional courses  it already affords us new and deeper ways to customize how students absorb material and how they link it to their own interests   haas dean rich lyons said in an article on the haas website about the new courses   this is the future  we need  to  shape it and be a leader   he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the first online course   data and decisions   will be rolled out in june for evening   weekend mba students   professional judgment in accounting   an undergraduate course  will begin online in july  and  power and politics   a popular mba elective  will be offered online to fulltime and evening and weekend students in the fall b semester </paragraph>
    <paragraph>haas specifically chose both quantitative and qualitative courses as well as faculty with different teaching styles for the pilot courses  according to jay stowsky  haas senior assistant dean for instruction  different vendors will implement each of the three courses to give haas the opportunity to compare effectiveness of different approaches to online education development  he added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>faculty and administrators hope the online courses will provide some advantages over traditional classroom courses  such as the ability to tailor material to individual students  needs and interests and the opportunity to encourage participation by students who might not be as likely to speak up in class </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this is a much safer environment that pushes them to contribute a lot more   says associate professor cameron anderson  who teaches the  power and politics  class   i think there is going to be a ton more participation   he also hopes students may actually learn more from one another than in the in class version of the course because they will be required to have more group discussions on their own </paragraph>
    <paragraph>finally  anderson hopes the digital courses will give students the important advantage of being able to go at their own pace   i ve heard from my students that my class is like drinking from a fire hose   he says   this online approach allows for self paced learning that i think will benefit students in their busy  time constrained lives  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>funding for the pilot digital courses comes from a    million matching gift from steve and susan chamberlin  mba     former members of the haas faculty </paragraph>

  <title>prospective mba applicants still overwhelmingly choose gmat over gre  kaplan survey finds</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the makers of the graduate record examination  gre  have revised their test and made a strong push to market it as an admissions alternative to the graduate management admissions test  gmat   but prospective mba applicants still overwhelmingly opt to take the gmat  a recent kaplan test prep survey finds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a survey of     kaplan gmat students between november      and april       kaplan found that only    percent said they considered taking the gre instead of the gmat  of the    percent who said they never considered taking the gre  the majority     percent  said the main reason was because they thought some or all of their target schools only accept the gmat  nineteen percent  meanwhile  said they felt applicants who submit a gmat score have an admissions advantage over those who submit a gre score  and   percent said it was because they thought they would do better on the gmat than on the gre </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in fact  prospective applicants who opted for the gmat over the gre because they thought their target schools don t accept the latter may have been misinformed  according to kaplan test prep director of graduate programs lee weiss   we believe that number may be inflated because of a lack of information   weiss said in a statement   many of them would be surprised to know that most  if not all of the business schools they plan on applying to accept the gre  in addition to the gmat   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite growing acceptance of the gre as an alternative to the gmat by top mba programs  kaplan test prep still advises prospective applicants to choose the more traditionally accepted gmat exam if they are applying only to business school and not to other graduate programs as well   according to a separate kaplan survey of business school admissions officers  applicants who submit a gmat score have a slight admissions advantage over applicants who submit a gre score   weiss said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the makers of the gmat aren t sitting by idle as the gre test makers try to gain more of the mba market  mind you  the gmat will feature an added integrated reasoning section beginning this june as part of an effort to solidify its status as the best predictor of student success in business school </paragraph>

  <title>fuqua school of business s loan assistance program helps graduates give back</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the loan assistance program  lap  at duke university s fuqua school of business  now in its   th year  has awarded almost    million to    fuqua alumni who participated in social impact activities as students and pursued work with nonprofit and government organizations upon graduation  thanks to lap  students like chad sclove  mba     have been able to apply the business skills they learn at fuqua to small organizations working hard to make a big difference </paragraph>
    <paragraph> without the loan assistance program  i wouldn t be in my current line of work   sclove says  participants in lap  which is managed by fuqua s center for the advancement of social enterprise  case  and its financial aid office  receive loan assistance disbursements twice a year  these awards  of up to          make it possible for students like sclove to meet their loan repayment responsibilities while taking work in fields with more modest pay  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sclove  who is now the managing director of common goods  a nonprofit consultancy that provides services to children with disabilities  hadn t even thought about working in the nonprofit world before coming to fuqua   the combination of fuqua s social enterprise curriculum  the activities of case  career counseling and the loan assistance program opened up new doors for me   he says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to ensure the sustainability of lap into the future amid growing demand for its services  a team of fuqua officials recently reviewed the program  they will implement some changes going forward in an effort to assure that available funds go to those who need them most </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beginning with the november      deadline  lap will handle applications and disbursements annually rather than twice a year and will start including spousal income and graduate school debt in their financial evaluation for each applicant  lap s administrators are also modifying the formula they use to determine what percentage of a student s household income is eligible for coverage through the program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>under the revised guidelines  new participants must opt in and apply for lap within three years of graduation to be eligible for the assistance available to their graduating class  and they must also describe their interest and participation in social impact activities at fuqua as part of the application  in an effort to expand the reach of the program  future classes will be eligible for awards of up to        per year for up to eight years after graduation  down from         per year for up to ten years </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we recognized the importance of improving the sustainability of the loan assistance program in order to bring it in line with our core belief that those with the greatest need should be eligible for the greatest awards   said matthew t a  nash  case s executive director   these modifications will enable fuqua to continue supporting leaders of consequence in the social sector  </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan researchers use neuroscience to understand consumer spending</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>what influences people s decisions to spend money  researchers at mit sloan s neuroeconomics laboratory are taking a closer look at brain activity to help uncover the answers  the school reported this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>using an expensive technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging  fmri   scientists at the athinoula a  martinos imaging center are scanning people s brains as they make real decisions involving money  hoping to test traditional assumptions about consumer spending  drazen prelec  a professor of management at mit sloan and in the mit economics and brain and cognitive sciences departments  is leading the research </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this could fulfill an ancient dream of revealing what is happening inside the head as we make decisions   prelec said as part of an article on the mit sloan website  glimpsing actual brain activity   especially with regard to trust or brand loyalty   could provide valuable new insight into decisions people make that defy conscious explanations   people may believe that they drink coke for the taste  but in reality they may be responding mainly to the brand image   prelec said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>recent research using brain scanning found that when making personal financial decisions online  subjects were more likely to trust bank representatives whose faces resembled their own   we suspect this is unconscious   prelec said   there may be deep evolutionary reasons for trusting someone who resembles you   he continued  adding that brain scans suggested that the mistrust of a stranger s face was mediated by a brain structure called the amygdala  responsible for rapid  unconscious judgments of fear and mistrust </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prelec and colleagues also have used brain scanning to understand how people feel about payment and personal finances  revealing that brain structures associated with pain were activated when subjects saw a high price appear next to a product they were considering purchasing  this could help explain why consumers favor purchasing arrangements that disguise the payment transactions  such as subscriptions  or why people seem more willing to pay a higher price when paying with credit rather than with cash  it may literally feel less painful </paragraph>

  <title>startup by harvard mbas to sell access to admitted students  application essay sets</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a startup business venture by six harvard business school  hbs  mbas will give prospective applicants access  for a fee  to actual sets of application essays written by candidates recently admitted to the school  according to a recent article in poets quants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>called mba bee to convey the idea of  spreading the pollen of knowledge   the main purpose of the new venture is to give applicants from international  military or other nontraditional backgrounds the same kind of access to information that counterparts from more traditional backgrounds like finance and consulting more typically have  say its founders   we want to lower the barrier between the people who have the knowledge and the people who desire it   may lam  one of the startup s co founders  told p q   for them  it s a lot more like shooting in the dark  once you see a couple of essay sets you will see some underlying themes that will help you present your best candidacy  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the goal of mba bee will be to build a database of successful essay sets which potential applicants can then buy according to key criteria that matches their own  such as career experience  age  and whether they are an international or domestic applicant  p q reports  and at least to start  the company s founders have convinced fellow classmates to surrender their own actual application s essays for free  though they would consider a revenue share agreement if it allowed them to build out the business and expand to other top schools  they told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba bee is not the first to seek to sell access to successful hbs application essays   editors of hbs s the harbus student newspaper have put out two editions of     successful harvard business school application essays  since       but the startup s founders think that providing essay answers from the same applicant to each of hbs s four application questions sets their offering apart   we felt there is a big need in the market for essay sets so applicants can see how successful applicants told their stories from start to finish   lam told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mba bee last month launched its first website  armedforcesmba com  where it will target military applicants  selling separate sets of essays from successful hbs applicants from each the army  air force  coast guard  marines corps and navy  the selling price will be      per set  though they are available now for a special introductory offer of     </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though not officially endorsed by the school  the new essay selling startup is an outgrowth of hbs s recently revised mba curriculum  in which student teams receive seed money from the school to create and launch a new product or service development project  p q reports </paragraph>

  <title>mba admissions staff monitor for plagiarism in application essays</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>following the disclosure earlier this year by ucla anderson school of management that it rejected    applicants to its mba program under suspicion of plagiarism  more business schools are turning to paid services that can detect when prospective applicants try to pass off pre canned work as part of their own application essays  a financial times article reports this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at ucla anderson  detecting plagiarism among applicants was an unanticipated result of going digital with its application process  anderson s admissions staff this year began reviewing all applications using ipads   once we went digital  all kinds of possibilities opened up  including the option to run admissions essays through turnitin   andrew ainslie  anderson s senior associate dean  told the ft  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>turnitin  one of several detection software programs available to higher education institutions  has the largest english language database with    billion web pages      million  scholarly items  secured through partnerships with publishers and     million papers submitted to the service  the ft reports  according to iparadigms  which markets turnitin  more than    percent of higher education institutions in north america and almost    per cent in the united kingdom have a turnitin license </paragraph>
    <paragraph>used initially more for coursework  admissions staff at institutions that have a turnitin license can check application essays against the database to receive a plagiarism percentage score  at ucla anderson  the decision was to reject applicants whose scores suggested they had plagiarized more than    percent of their admissions essays </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the ft report  plagiarism among mba applicants may be on the rise even as business schools attempt to refocus  matriculated students on ethics and honor codes following the financial crisis   places on exceptional mba programs are scarce commodities and the economic return is so substantial that some people are prepared to risk and to try things that would gain them an unfair advantage   dave wilson  chief executive of the graduate management admission council  gmac   which owns and administers the gmat entrance exam  told the ft  for its part  gmac has invested heavily in biometric palm vein technology to deter cheating on the gmat </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some schools find that simply introducing turnitin or another detection software leads to a drop in plagiarism  according to the ft  at the uk s grenoble graduate school of business  turnitin s introduction has led to a drop in plagiarism from about   in    essays to   in      patrick o sullivan  the school s director of studies  told the ft   we noticed initially a rise   because we were detecting more   he said   and then a fall in the last two years   particularly dramatic in the last year  it seems the word has got out among students  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>not all schools have decided to use plagiarism detection software for the application process  but more are considering it  the ft reports   we talked about the ucla anderson story here  to check whether we needed to do something similar   elaine romanelli  senior associate dean at georgetown mcdonough school of business  told the ft   we use turnitin here  but not on admissions essays  however  we do avoid essay questions like  explain the role of business schools in preventing another financial meltdown   because we know they are more likely to find answers to these on the internet   she said </paragraph>

  <title>alumni based lending program for mba students to head to the united states</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>prodigy finance  a london based company started in      by insead alumni  expects to enter the u s  business school market later this year with new options for international students who need loans to fund their education  according to a report this week in bloomberg businessweek  last week  the united kingdom s cranfield school of management signed on to prodigy s online community based loan program  becoming the second in that country and the sixth in europe to adopt it </paragraph>
    <paragraph>created by three insead alumni who themselves had trouble securing funding when they were international mbas  the prodigy program allows alumni of a particular school to place money in community education bonds that provide loans for students who follow behind them at that school  the loans  which carry an average     percent interest rate  are competitive with other loan providers in the u s  and europe  and students are required to repay them within seven years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy s model uses a  predictive scorecard  to assess a student s future earning potential  rather than previous income and work history  which traditional banks use  investors can expect a six percent return on their investment and receive the names and bios of the students they invest in  cameron stevens  prodigy s chief executive officer and a co founder of the company  told bloomberg bw   it s a very transparent investment and that concept really resonates with alumni   stevens said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy s platform comes at a time when many business schools are in need of just such a solution  the bloomberg bw article notes  several prominent loan programs that helped international students finance study at european business schools have dried up  and many business schools in the united states have had a hard time finding options for their international students that don t require a u s  co signer since the end of the citiassist loan program in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there definitely is a gap out there and the market has not come back   kevin moehn of moehn management  a company that works with banks to facilitate student loans  told bloomberg bw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy  which has raised about     million in funding for students attending european business schools and hopes to raise      million by the end of the year  expects to sign additional european schools in the next few months and enter the u s  market this june  stevens told bloomberg bw  insead  the university of oxford s said business school and russia s skolkovo school of management are among the schools that have already signed on with prodigy </paragraph>

  <title>video outlines upcoming curriculum changes at cmu s tepper school of business</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>late last year  the tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university announced that it will roll out a new curriculum next fall incorporating more training in leadership and writing  these represent important shifts for a school best known for its heavy focus on teaching quantitative skills  as part of the new curriculum  tepper first year students also will have more training in core subject areas before recruiters arrive on campus </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a new video posted to the tepper website this week  mike trick  senior associate dean of education  talks about the new mba curriculum and how it builds on tepper s deep allegiance to business fundamentals and data analysis while helping better prepare first year students for interviews with recruiters   </paragraph>
    <paragraph> businesses want interns to be useful right away and therefore our curriculum has to provide useful people right from the get go   trick says  noting that recruiters have begun coming to campus earlier and earlier   the problem for us was that when people were coming in  to interview  for internships  they  students  knew the fundamentals but they didn t know the specifics of marketing or finance   he continued  in response  tepper has tried to move a few core courses up earlier and has introduced a new intensive pre program called basecamp providing an integrated overview of business and how the core disciplines and business functions work together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>robert dammon  who became dean last may after serving for    years as a professor of financial economics at the school  is spearheading the changes to tepper s curriculum as well as embarking upon an ambitious fundraising effort to build a bigger building to accommodate tepper s growing class  he told the wall street journal  wsj  in a recent interview that he hopes to expand the mba program by as much as    percent  to     students  in order to take advantage of economies of scale </paragraph>

  <title>u k  schools explore new mba loan options</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in an effort to help prospective mba students finance their programs as traditional bank sources for loans have dried up  business schools in the united kingdom are turning to a model developed by insead alumni in which alumni of a business school invest in those who will follow after them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the company  london based prodigy finance  was set up by three insead alumni  graduates of the school invest in the future careers of classmates who follow behind with the expectation that they will receive a good rate of return on their investment  the university of oxford s said business school announced last december that it has created a program with prodigy  and the financial times reported this week that the cranfield school of management has followed suit   several other top u k  business schools are expected to launch similar arrangements before the next mba enrollment in september  the ft added </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we deliberately only partner with world class business schools like cranfield that offer leading mba programs that consistently perform well in the major mba rankings   ryan steele  chief operating officer at prodigy finance  told the ft   the program provides alumni and other investors the opportunity to earn a competitive return on their investment while helping to fund future business leaders  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in contrast to traditional bank loans  prodigy assesses a student s future potential earnings   and by extension his or her ability to repay the loans   using a predictive scorecard rather than historic salary data  cranfield mbas from more than     countries will be eligible to apply online for the loan once the new program is fully in place </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley s haas school of business to expand campus  perhaps increase mba class size</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley is planning a multi million dollar campus expansion  including the construction of a new building  which could provide for an increase in the size of the school s full time mba class  according to a report last week in the daily californian </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new building  which is expected to cost     million to construct  would provide for new classrooms and learning spaces  michelle mcclellan  assistant dean of development and alumni relations for the business school and the top fundraiser for the project  told the daily californian  an additional     million could go to proposed renovations and enhancement of the school s library and courtyard  she added  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> haas had undertaken a master space planning project several years back  and this was eventually the outburst of that   mcclellan said   it s been a process that has evolved over time  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>mcclellan did not provide a timeline for the project s completion  stating that fundraising began in january      and that     million has thus far been pledged  mcclellan acknowledged that expansion of the full time mba program is one possibility that is being considered quite seriously as part of the overall expansion project although several other options are also being looked at and no official decisions have been made yet </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i think it would be great if we expanded our mba program  it s very small relative to other mba programs in the u s    one of the smallest in the country   nancy wallace  haas professor of real estate  told the daily californian  haas  full time mba program enrolls approximately     students per year  compared to about     at stanford graduate school of business and closer to     at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school and harvard business school </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in an interview with poets quants  haas dean richard lyons said that the new building would allow the school to increase the size of its full time program to     once completed  he also allowed that the new space could enable haas to launch a second executive mba program in addition to its current joint partnership emba with columbia university in new york   this new building will give us some real options   he told p q </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nonetheless  significant fundraising remains before the project can get underway   we cannot break ground until we have all commitments   mcclellan told the daily californian </paragraph>

  <title>u s  schools increase one year mba programs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as applications to two year  full time mba programs declined for a third consecutive year  more u s  schools are beginning to offer one year programs to attract a different type of student  the financial times reports  though one year programs have been standard at most european business schools for some time  some industry experts worry about their limitations in the united states  the ft continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph> european programs for the most part require significant pre enrolment work experience   john fernandes  president and chief executive of the association to advance collegiate schools of business aacsb   told the ft   with this  a one year program may be fine for some students who are mostly interested in returning to and advancing within their current company  for students with little or no professional experience  it is a stretch to get all they need in one year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools point out that one year programs have a particular appeal in lean economic years since they are both less expensive and represent a lesser opportunity cost since students leave the workforce for a shorter period of time to complete them  that said  accelerated courses usually appeal to a different target student   one that is older and more seasoned  but not as experienced as those who look toward executive mba programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s a certain type of student that s drawn to the one year program   katie lloyd  an admissions officer at emory s goizueta business school  told the ft   they re more focused   she said  adding that a lot of self selection goes on </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft article noted that goizueta is one of a handful of top tier programs that have for some time offered an accelerated one year  full time option  others include cornell s johnson school of business and northwestern s kellogg school of management  but students who elect a one year program must keep in mind the ways in which it differs from the more traditional two year programs  school administrators caution </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specifically  graduates of one year programs face greater recruiting challenges  since they will graduate at the same time as students in two year programs but will not have gone through an interview cycle or completed a summer internship  the ft article notes   they have to work a bit harder to find jobs   randy allen  associate dean for international and corporate relations at johnson  told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>school officials also concede that it can be hard to cover all the basics of an mba and still provide time for electives such as entrepreneurship or ethics   the experience is different   allen told the ft   the core is done in a condensed time frame  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the aacbs s fernandez worries that even with requirements that applicants to one year programs have a strong financial background  the compressed offerings still may not adequately prepare students for the job search   i don t think they re a good idea in terms of what the employment market wants out of business graduates   fernandes told the ft   a lot of the traditional schools are shaking their heads   but he understands the conditions that have led schools to expand their offerings   the economic realities are forcing schools to make do the best they can   he said </paragraph>

  <title>business schools look beyond traditional business arenas for role models for strategy and leadership</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>top mba programs including those at harvard business school  hbs  and the mit sloan school of management are turning to the likes of lady gaga and shakespeare to provide examples of successful leadership and strategy  according to a recent article in the toronto star  in the wake of the financial crisis and the resulting loss of faith in leadership  they ve had little choice but to look outside the traditional business world in order to continue teaching by example  the canadian paper suggests   at hbs  a class called strategic marketing in creative industries gives students a chance to examine the career moves of    year old stefani germanotta and her transformation into pop icon lady gaga  the hbs course looks to gaga to understand the importance of contracts and how to manage your message through social media  business schools in europe   including germany s esmt and antwerp management in the netherlands   also have zeroed in on gaga as a case study to teach strategic innovation  the toronto star reports  and the london business school had students look at kiss guitarist gene simmons for lessons on how to monetize a fan base </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  at schools like the mit sloan school of management and nyu s stern school of business  shakespeare s julius caesar and henry v are providing examples of leadership to students  and at canadians schools like toronto university s rotman school  hockey stars are coming in as speakers to advise and inspire future business leaders  toronto maple leafs  gm brian burke recently shared his views on steve jobs and the need to be tough   there isn t anyone who has made a hard decision who doesn t have a ruthless side   he told the students </paragraph>

  <title>northwestern s kellogg school of management charts new course</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the kellogg school of management at northwestern university yesterday announced a new comprehensive strategy that includes shrinking its two year mba program  enlarging its one year mba program  expanding its global footprint and sharpening its brand  the plan  coined envision kellogg  follows from an in depth strategic review led by dean sally blount  who assumed leadership of kellogg in july      </paragraph>
    <paragraph> there are times in history when transformational change becomes imperative for an organization   because the world in which that organization has thrived fundamentally changes   blount said on a website launched yesterday to communicate the new strategy   now is one of those times for kellogg  the nature of business and how it operates in the   st century requires that we rethink who we are and how we do what we do   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through envision kellogg  the school hopes to  shape business education and thought leadership for the   st century   the website proclaims  the    month      degree assessment that informed the new strategy involved more than       alumni  faculty  administrators  students  corporate partners and others and was completed with the assistance of consulting firms booz   co   boston consulting group and deloitte </paragraph>
    <paragraph>among other things  this comprehensive review revealed increasing demand for the school s    month mba program for students who already have an undergraduate degree  application volume and class size for this program have both been on the rise since       while applications to kellogg s full time two year mba program have fallen in the last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> it s very clear that growth in demand for the two year mba is going to be slowing and that growth for one year programs will be growing   blount said in an interview with poetsandquants   we have to be realistic about the market in which we find ourselves  we think the market for two year mbas is going to get very elite  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for this reason  kellogg plans to market its one year program more aggressively  blount told poetsandquants that she thinks enrollment in kellogg s one year mba program could grow from its current    students to perhaps     over the next five years  while enrollment in the school s two year program could fall to about     students from       </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the two year mba is a stunning product that we are very proud of   blount told poetsandquants   we are definitely staying in that market  but we are preparing for a world where the best students may not want that and they have options  we don t think    something people from china are going to come to the u s  for a two year degree  the opportunity cost is just perceived to be too high  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the strategic plan also calls for the creation of four  impact areas  that will reorganize how the school conducts research and what makes up its curriculum  these four areas   coined  markets  customers and growth    innovation and entrepreneurship    architectures of collaboration   and  private enterprise and public policy    are intended to provide a framework for study within kellogg s traditional core academic areas of finance  accounting  marketing  strategy  organizational behavior  and managerial economics and decision sciences </paragraph>

  <title>european business schools see application volume drop</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>two thirds of european business schools saw application volume drop last year after rising steadily for years  according to the graduate management admissions council  gmac   which administers the gmat entrance exam used by most schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>an article yesterday in the wall street journal highlighted gmac application trend data  noting that some european schools saw the number of applicants fall by more than    percent even before the latest round of economic challenges hit the region  even schools in more economically stable countries like switzerland and the united kingdom have been affected  in part because their tuitions have been rendered increasingly steep by falling currencies in neighboring countries  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the journal article  european students who can afford it have been looking to programs overseas   either at u s  schools or at the overseas campuses of european schools   as a means of setting themselves up for better post graduate employment options  spain s iese business school in barcelona saw its application volume drop   percent this year as locals  deterred by the country s      percent unemployment rate  have applied overseas instead  the journal reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  in switzerland  imd business school is having a harder time convincing european students that its program is worth the investment  especially as the euro s value has dropped against the swiss franc  applications from students from western europe  which account for    percent of the swiss school s class  dropped    percent  imd has increased financial aid by a third  delayed payment deadlines and encouraged students to apply for more loans in an effort to counteract the drop in applicants  the journal reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>likewise  italy s sda bocconi school of management is now extending merit based tuition waivers  one for    percent of tuition costs and another for    percent  to students from countries other than italy in western europe </paragraph>
    <paragraph>other european schools with campuses in different regions of the world have seen european students favor those locations instead  the journal article added  for example  the shanghai campus of france s grenoble graduate school of business has had an uptick in european students over the past two years </paragraph>
    <paragraph>telio gourdon  a master s student in international business at grenoble s singapore campus  says he was motivated to leave his native france by the prospect of greater international exposure and better post graduation employment options   singapore is a good place to be for a businessman   he told the journal </paragraph>

    <paragraph>the new program will blend darden s case method instruction and team building and entrepreneurial approaches with curry s evidence based work in teacher effectiveness  curriculum innovations and measureable student gains  in addition to classroom based instruction  students also will participate in residency internships with partners for credit  these experiences will give students opportunities in real world education settings  such as the darden curry partnership for leaders in education  ple   charter schools and management organizations  state agencies and large high need urban school districts </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the program will be spread over the course of    months  totaling      credit hours       credit hours from darden and    credit hours from curry   course work will take place as part of five modules made up of courses drawn from both schools designed to give students a firm grounding in basic business and education subjects  their intersection  and a range of electives depending on the students own interests </paragraph>

  <title>chicago booth admissions committee provides waitlist update</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a change to its waitlist process this year  the university of chicago booth school of business will feature a waitlist enrollment form allowing candidates to immediately opt in or out of the list and will permit waitlisted candidates to submit a    second video update regarding their candidacy  the admissions committee shared this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a post yesterday to the booth insider  the school s mba admissions blog  associate director of admissions carrie lydon shared these and other updates regarding the waitlist process  the applications of candidates who accept the offer to become part of the waitlist will be considered for admission again as part of round   and will receive an updated decision on march   st  the final decision date for the round   we will try to make a final decision by that point  but there is a possibility that you could remain on the waitlist through round     lydon wrote  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>chicago booth has introduced the new waitlist enrollment form in an effort to give candidates the opportunity to decide what is best for them while helping the admissions committee better understand who is genuinely interested in remaining on the list  the form is in no way binding  though  and candidates who have indicated they wish to remain on the list can withdraw themselves at any point by emailing admissions chicagobooth edu </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as in past years  chicago booth s admissions committee invites waitlisted candidates to send relevant updates regarding their candidacy  to be added to their files for consideration as part of future rounds   the content and format of an update is entirely up to you  but ideally the materials you provide should add insight into your qualifications and strength of fit with chicago booth beyond what was presented in your original application   lydon wrote  updates can be submitted via the  upload materials  section of the applicant status page </paragraph>
    <paragraph>new this year  waitlisted candidates can also upload a    second video for the admissions committee   in the age of digital media  we recognize that video is a common tool of communication  and want to provide any interested candidate with the opportunity to use it   says lydon  here  too  the content is up to the candidate  videos can be uploaded via the  portfolio  section of applicant status page  all updates must be submitted no later than march  st </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in her post  lydon stressed that this year s round   was a very competitive one and that the admissions committee was simply unable to accept every qualified applicant   while it likely wasn t the news you were hoping to hear  if you received a waitlist notification  please know that the waitlist is a good place to be   she wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to those who do decide to accept a place on the chicago booth waitlist  best of luck from all of us here at clear admit  don t forget that you can share your experiences and learn from those of others on the clear admit wiki </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school admissions director shares round   notification plans</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a recent post to her director s blog  harvard business school  hbs  dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold shared her team s plans to notify prospective candidates who submitted applications as part of hbs s round   this year </paragraph>
    <paragraph> on monday  december   th   hopefully at noon boston time   all round   interviewees will receive an email saying their decision is available online   she wrote  she added that her team does not make any calls ahead of time   none  and that s a promise   she said   whatever the news is for you  we want to make sure you at least have control over the timing   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph> on december   th  candidates who have been admitted or denied a place in the next hbs class will learn their fate  in addition  leopold shared  her team will invite about     or so candidates to join the waitlist  those who are invited to join this list will receive additional information from dana scalisi  who manages this process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold will also have call in hours in january for candidates who are denied admissions after an interview   i wouldn t call these  feedback  calls since they aren t very detailed but sometimes it can be reassuring to hear that there were not specific weaknesses in an application  but rather just the reality of a highly selective process with the goal of maximizing the mix of voices and perspectives in the classroom   she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>good luck to all those who are waiting anxiously </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school incorporates new field method into curriculum</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph> if it works  the field method could become an equal partner to the case method   harvard business school  hbs  dean nitin nohria told the economist in a recent interview  the field method  field immersion experience for leadership development  is a new practical addition to hbs s curriculum  a radical departure from a course of study that until now has been based exclusively on discussing cases written by professors in classroom settings  according to the economist report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nohria arrived at hbs in july      determined to see that hbs students get more in the way of practical application of management skills than just what they gain from summer internships with prospective employers  as a result  this year s incoming class will serve as guinea pigs for the new field method  which will include three elements as part of the first year  the economist reports  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>first  they will participate in a team building exercise in which students take turns leading a group project loosely based on ones used in the u s  army  second  students will travel to work for a week with one of more than     firms in    countries  finally  hbs first years wil be given eight weeks and        worth of seed money each to launch a small company  what will happen in the second year of the new field course remains to be determined </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some have expressed skepticism about elements of the new curriculum component   the literature suggests that an immersion experience needs to be at least     weeks and be backed up with time in the classroom   management guru pankaj ghemawat told the economist  raising questions about how effective a one week work assignment overseas will be  and the faculty vote in favor of trying the new field method was  as enthusiastic as you could get from a faculty   nohria told the economist  noting that it gave approval for a  delicate experiment for     years to see if we can move the needle   the case method  by comparison  took    years to develop </paragraph>
    <paragraph>notably  the new course adds    to    percent to the         hbs students currently pay per year of study  for the time being  hbs is bearing this additional cost as it figures out what works  the economist reports </paragraph>

  <title>hec paris tops financial times       european business school rankings</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>hec paris maintained its number one position in the financial times  ranking of best european business schools this year  released this week  insead bumped london business school from number two to number three  and spain s iese business school and switzerland s imd came in at fourth and fifth respectively  overall  there were no dramatic changes in the line up of top european schools save the rapid ascent of italy s sda bocconi school of management  which tied for seventh this year as compared to its three year rank of   th </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a special report accompanying the rankings  the ft s della bradshaw pointed out that european schools  which until now attracted non european applicants with their diverse student bodies and globally focused curriculums  face several new threats that could undermine these advantages  chief among them are the continuing euro crisis and the reluctance of european governments to award post degree work visas to non europeans as well as the rapid rise of chinese and indian business schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dipak jain  who took the helm as dean of insead this year after retiring as dean of northwestern  kellogg school of management  does not believe that european schools will feel an immediate impact from the rising number of quality asian schools    there is still a very large part of the asian world that wants a western program   he told the ft   that is not going to go away in the next    years or so  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to jain  the real problem european schools face is money  he points out that european schools lack the robust endowments that many u s  business schools boast  which limits the european institutions  ability to fund top level research   the question is  how do you create shock absorbers or cushions   he told the ft   in europe you can t rely on alumni giving  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but according to peter tufano  who like jain this year traded a u s  school for a european one  tufano left harvard business school to become dean of the said business school at oxford   there is no real difference between schools on either side of the atlantic   i see a lot more similarities than differences   tufano told the ft  noting that the issues being talked about in business and in business school are the same on both sides of the pond  views are even converging on issues like the supremacy of shareholder value  which used to divide the teaching between u s  and european schools   i think everyone has adopted a more nuanced view than when i did an mba   there are times i can close my eyes and i don t really feel i am in a different place   tufano said </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>the association to advance collegiate schools of business  aacsb  last week accredited the indian school of business  isb   making the indian school the first in south asia to be recognized by the american based accrediting organization </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we are delighted to have received the prestigious aacsb accreditation  which is regarded as the hallmark of excellence in business education   isb dean ajit rangnekar said in a statement   we are confident that this recognition will translate into increased interest by the international community comprising of faculty  students and recruiters  and help us chart asia s and india s growth as the global management education hub   added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>aacsb accreditation has been earned by less than five percent of the world s business schools  isb reports  of the     business schools currently accredited by the global organization  the vast majority are in the united states  to achieve aacsb accreditation  schools must undergo a process of rigorous internal review  evaluation and adjustment and meet a series of high standards  including demonstrating a high quality teaching environment  a commitment to continuous improvement and curricula responsive to the needs of businesses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the financial times  isb s accreditation could pave the way for increased competition between the two principle international accreditation bodies  aacsb from the united states and equis from europe  equis already accredits two indian business schools  the indian institutes of management in ahmedabad and bangalore  the ft anticipates that the two accrediting bodies are likely to see a surge in applications from other institutions  as indian business schools try to carve a role on the global stage </paragraph>

    <paragraph>in a recent article in bized magazine  ucla anderson school of management dean judy olian took a hard look at the global business school landscape  assessing the obstacles and triumphs of the past decade as well as the challenges that face its future  a decade out from chairing a task force that characterized management education as  at risk   olian says now that she sees reason for  tempered cheer  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>ten years ago the concerns about the future of business schools were linked to a shortage of academically qualified faculty  a curriculum considered increasingly irrelevant and increased competition from non accredited institutions  writes olian  today  though not eradicated  several of these problems have been addressed to some degree </paragraph>
    <paragraph>though the number of u s  trained phds in business and management almost doubled between      and       an explosive growth in business schools globally has meant that the increase still hasn t been sufficient to keep pace with demand  resulting in fierce competition among schools for qualified faculty  but a shift toward attracting professionally  rather than academically  qualified teachers has helped alleviate faculty shortages  olian writes </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this trend toward embracing senior level business professionals to fill faculty roles has also helped address concerns regarding the relevancy of the business school curriculum   schools have not only hired more practitioners as faculty  but also introduced creative curricula and pedagogical innovations that are more market focused  career oriented  technologically supported  and globally immersive   she writes  still  schools need to break free from traditionally rigid faculty department structures to better align programs with the real business world  and management education leaders need to lend their voices and ideas to important societal issues such as education  poverty  healthcare and sustainability  olian stresses </paragraph>
    <paragraph>fragmentation of the graduate management education landscape has only grown more pronounced over the past decade  olian writes  with more types of providers  more campuses  and more diversity of programs than ever before  meanwhile  the cost of business school has soared  rendering many schools inaccessible and unaffordable  the economic crisis has damaged job prospects for some graduates and critics of management education have grown more vocal  calling the virtuousness of business education into question </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if i were writing a report today on the future of business schools  i d title it  realizing the promise of business schools for the world  still much to accomplish    olian says </paragraph>

  <title>carnegie mellon s tepper school of business revamps curriculum</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the tepper school of business at carnegie mellon university  a school known for its heavy focus on teaching quantitative skills  will roll out a new curriculum next fall incorporating more training in leadership and writing  the school also has moved to teaching core subject areas before recruiters arrive on campus in an effort to better prepare first years to secure summer internships in an increasingly competitive environment </paragraph>
    <paragraph>robert dammon  who became dean last may after serving for    years as a professor of financial economics at the school  is shepherding these changes as well as embarking upon an ambitious fundraising effort to build a bigger building to accommodate tepper s growing class  he told the wall street journal  wsj  in a recent interview that he hopes to expand the mba program by as much as    percent  to     students  in order to take advantage of economies of scale </paragraph>
    <paragraph>dammon told the wsj that he thinks the curriculum changes will actually strengthen the school s reputation as a quantitative powerhouse   it s a matter of embedding opportunities for students to develop their communication and leadership skills within other courses   he said   in our electives  which  are  analytically focused  we will give students opportunities to present  to do projects  you can do the best analysis in the world on a problem  but you re going to have no effect on anybody if you can t communicate what it is you ve done  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>he also indicated that the decision to push core courses on disciplines like finance  marketing and operations to earlier in the first semester was driven by pressure from recruiters to interview students for internships earlier and earlier   they would love to come in the first week of classes if they could   dammon told the wsj   students were not really getting exposure to the material before sitting in interviews   in response  the school now offers a new orientation program called basecamp designed to give students an integrated view of business before they meet with recruiters   instead of learning just finance  or just marketing  or just operations  they re getting how all these things fit together   dammon said </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg dean provides life  career advice to part time mba students</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>speaking recently as part of student organized speaker series at the kellogg school of management s saturday mba program  kellogg dean sally blount advised students that true leadership begins with strong  inspired work and is supported by building relationships and fostering dialog </paragraph>
    <paragraph> you want to be known as a person who makes things happen  but does so in an understated  collaborative way   she told the part time students   people want to work with people like this  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>before becoming dean of kellogg in       blount held positions at the university of chicago booth school of business and new york university s stern school of business  and in these and other positions she eventually learned to follow her inner instincts rather than cater to social expectations  she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph> i ve been rewarded every time i ve hunkered down and done what i believe in   she said   that has to be our goal   to do work out of passion  love and belief  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>blount also encouraged building real relationships rather than simply networking   building relationships creates reasons to follow up   she said  stressing that mindful and consistent personal connections are much more meaningful than widespread networking through social networks like facebook and linkedin </paragraph>
    <paragraph> networking may be in vogue  but she was clear that relationship building is really where long term success lies   said kellogg student mohan kompella  who helped organize the speaking event  in a post talk q a session  blount also stressed that true leaders need to set realistic work life expectations </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the idea of relationship building and her challenge for us to understand all phases of our lives and the tradeoffs that might have to be made were important words to hear   kompella continued </paragraph>

  <title>oxford s said business school to launch new       specialized master s and mba program</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>peter tufano  the newly appointed dean of the said business school at the university of oxford  wants to ensure that the u k  school can compete with the best u s  business schools  which is part of why he s rolling out a new one year  combined master s degree mba program  the financial times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>tufano  who heralds from harvard business school  says the new       program  as it is being called  is about  depth plus breadth   participating students will be able to dive into a specialized subject   such as environmental management or education   while also obtaining the breadth of a business degree   the choice has been between one year or two  for an mba   now you can do one or two  but a different two   tufano told the ft  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the university is in the final stages of approval for the new combined program  and an initial four departments   geography and the environment  education  computer science and the oxford internet institute   hope to enroll students in       according to tufano  most of the     year long postgraduate master s programs at oxford could be potential future program partners </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new program is designed to provide students with an option similar to two year mba programs at top u s  schools  in which they get to choose from a wide range of electives after completing core business courses  because fees for master s degrees are lower than for an mba  the total cost of the     program at oxford will come in at up to         less than the cost of a two year mba at harvard or wharton   somewhere between          and           according to the ft report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the move toward combining general business study with specialized master s programs is a growing trend  other schools such as the indian business school  the ross school of business at the university of michigan and stanford graduate school of business have all adopted similar approaches in recent years  at stanford  one in six mba students are currently enrolled in combined programs  a number dean garth saloner hopes to see move toward one in four </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business exclusive academic period ends</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>acronyms abound at stanford graduate school of business  gsb   and an important one is eap  which stands for exclusive academic period  what s that  you ask  eap refers to the first six weeks of school  when first year mba students are supposed to place an exclusive focus on their academics </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it s  kind of a  no fly zone  where organized extracurricular activities are put off until after midterm exams   writes allison davis  associate director of mba admissions  in a recent post to the stanford mba admissions blog   the idea is that incoming students can get used to being back in school without having to juggle a full calendar   davis continues </paragraph>
    <paragraph>eap came to a close at the gsb on november  st  and without missing a beat students organized a huge student activities fair on november  nd  where all the student clubs came out to recruit  more than    clubs were represented  ranging from the africa business club  the energy club  the rugby club  and even gsb dogs   a group for gsb dogs  dog owners and dog lovers    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>beyond providing an introduction to the staggering array of clubs and activities available to join  the fair also gave students a chance to sign up to be matched with alumni mentors  to join the women s entrepreneurship mentoring program  or to become an arbuckle leadership fellow  where they ll get advanced leadership training and coach other students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  all of these options can contribute to another acronym at the gsb  davis warns  something called fomo or  fear of missing out   as at so many top business schools  students at stanford gsb sometimes struggle with how to decide how to spend their time  she says  about the student activities fair   it was a veritable smorgasbord and reminded me how much of the richness of the learning here occurs outside the classroom   says davis </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business receives largest ever alumni gift to combat poverty in emerging markets</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  has received the largest gift in its history       million from alumnus robert king  mba      and his wife dorothy  to focus on alleviating poverty in emerging markets  the financial times reports  the generous gift will establish the institute for innovation in developing economies  charged with finding ways to apply the entrepreneurial skills of the school s students to spur economic growth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to king and his wife  their interest in developing economies was an outgrowth of hosting some of stanford s international students in their home  including a chinese student who was instrumental in founding baidu  a chinese language search engine  king s venture investment firm  peninsular capital  provided seed money to baidu  which has since grown into an internet giant employing more than        people in china </paragraph>
    <paragraph>king says that providing seed money or microfinancing will not be the primary focus of this new venture with stanford gsb  which will instead focus on growing established businesses   one of the challenges is to take businesses to scale   king told the ft   it s the on the ground work that really excites me  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new institute will work with not for profit organizations  ngos and entrepreneurs in developing countries  and stanford mba students will be encouraged to participate in related projects between their first and second years of study  according to the ft report  in addition to this on the ground work  the institute also will focus on academic research and teaching through courses for stanford students and alumni as well as for entrepreneurs from developing countries  whose study in california the institute will fund </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the end goal here is poverty alleviation and capacity building for stanford university   dean garth saloner told the ft  he added that the multidisciplinary approach of the center   although housed at the business school  every department of the university could be involved   distinguishes it from other initiatives   i do think directionally that this  alleviating poverty in developing economies  is the sort of activity that people do not usually associate with a business school   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft article notes that stanford has been leading the way among top business school in developing interdisciplinary teaching in response to growing recognition that public policy  law and regulation increasingly inform business decisions  according to the ft report  one in six stanford mba students are part of a double degree program  also working toward degrees in engineering  law  or public policy  saloner told the ft that he hopes to increase that number to one in four </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft reports that the agreement between stanford gsb and the kings took    months to negotiate  the kings have given      million to fund the institute and committed an additional     million in matched funding in an effort to involve other donors in the project </paragraph>

  <title>new gmat could require additional test preparation time for mba candidates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>some test preparation experts believe that the new gmat exam  which the graduate management admissions council  gmac  will introduce in june       could require test takers to study for as much as    to    extra hours in order to obtain high scores  according to an article in the financial times this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new gmat exam will replace one of the two essay questions that is part of the existing exam with an integrative reasoning test featuring four more types of questions than the current quantitative and verbal sections  andrew mitchell  director of pre business programs at test preparation firm kaplan  is warning prospective applicants that are planning to take the new exam that they could need to prepare for longer to get a high score  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to gmac s own research  test takers currently study an average of     hours in preparation for the gmat  mitchell told the ft that he believes this could potentially rise to     or     hours with the new test  the ft article acknowledged that kaplan makes its money from would be mbas and therefore has a vested interest in promoting test preparation  mitchell  for his part  stressed that busy applicants who plan to submit their applications toward the end of      for      entry could face real concerns if they wait until the last minute to take the test   people applying next fall may not be aware of the issues   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the ft article noted that the graduate record examination  gre  is increasingly being accepted by business schools as an alternate entry test to the mba  the gre also changed its examination and scoring system  in august of this past year  though test takers who has sat the new exam have not yet received their scores  a recent kaplan poll of more than     business schools found that more than    percent accept the gre as well as the gmat  the ft reports  but according to kaplan s mitchell  the number of applicants submitting gre scores is very small   the gmat sends a strong signal that you are interested in business   mitchell told the ft </paragraph>

  <title>kellogg school of management hosts innovating social change conference</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>earlier this month  the kellogg school of management at northwestern university hosted a daylong social impact conference featuring seth goldman  honest tea co founder and president  as keynote </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the next generation of social impact  was the theme of this year s innovating social change conference  which took place at kellogg on october   th  the annual conference  now in its   th year  is one of several student led events at kellogg   </paragraph>
    <paragraph>honest tea s goldman encouraged conference attendees to target business practices toward social responsibility rather than making social impact a sideline consideration   if you make     million and do something nice with    million  you ve missed the mark   he said  coca cola  recognizing that environmental consciousness and social responsibility were becoming more important to their consumers  in march      acquired honest tea  which has a recognized commitment to natural ingredients and fair trade practices  according to goldman  coke s acquisition was as much for honest tea s brand message as it was to round out its beverage line up </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the conference also featured a range of panel discussions  including one entitled  money vs  talent  achieving scale in social impact  moderated by kellogg lecturer of social enterprise jason saul  saul noted that more and more large corporations  like coca cola  are recognizing that their consumers are demanding more social responsibility   companies are trying to bottle  package and sell social impact   saul said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>panelists   such as liam krehbiel      founder and ceo of venture philanthropy fund a better chicago   shared ways to harness corporate interest to increase the impact of social responsibility  on behalf of corporations  krehbiel s organization researches the best education nonprofits in the area to help companies achieve a greater impact   they trust us to find the best organizations and make an impact with pooled resources   krehbiel said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mission and message of the recent conference dovetails with kellogg s new  think bravely  campaign  which suggests that to truly impact the world  future business leaders must couple strong business savvy with social responsibility </paragraph>
    <paragraph>darell hammond  founder of kaboom   which uses corporate donations and employee volunteerism to build playgrounds  urged kellogg students attending the conference to carry what they d learned with them regardless of where their careers were headed   everything you touch  make better   he said   you don t have to start a company to do that  </paragraph>

  <title>top business schools combine admissions for full time  part time  executive mba programs</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>duke university s fuqua school of business  columbia business school  cbs   northwestern s kellogg school of management and spain s ie business school are among top mba programs that are introducing a combined admissions process in which students who get rejected from a full time mba program can more easily be offered admission to a part time or executive mba offering instead  the financial times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through combined admissions  schools can look for applicants whose profiles may not be strong enough to secure a spot in the full time mba program but who might be well suited for the part time or executive mba programs  for example  students with low gmat scores but valuable work experience could be admitted to the emba cohort at certain programs instead of the full time mba program  admissions officials told the ft  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>schools that embrace combined admissions are able to merge the admissions functions of different programs within the school  realizing cost savings and better meeting their recruiting targets by being able to market the traditional full time mba as well as the part time and executive programs to applicants to ensure that each student finds a fit with one program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at cbs  for example  vice dean amir ziv helped centralize admissions two years ago  before then  the full time mba and emba were separate divisions and instead of co operating they were almost competing  for students    ziv told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at ie  meanwhile  the new system helps direct highly qualified students who may not gain admission to the full time mba program to consider alternate programs instead  strong candidates who are turned down for ie s flagship international mba program now undergo a more formal counseling process about which other programs could be a fit  lisa bevil  director of full time admissions  told the ft  ten percent of students who applied to one program now study in another as a result of the new system  she said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the university of michigan s ross school of business combined admissions two years ago  and since then     students have applied to the part time program instead of the emba after receiving advice from admissions counselors about better fit  ross director of admissions soojin koh told the ft   they would have all applied to the emba and probably would have not been admitted  because they had mis evaluated their experience   koh said  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>combined admissions is also helping schools cut costs   we didn t have shared accountability for the enrolment results       there was no formal process for cross selling and there was no co ordinated marketing plan   liz riley hargrove  associate dean for admission at duke  told the ft about the school s previous system  now   we save a significant amount of money just by co ordinating the  recruiting  schedule   she added  </paragraph>

    <paragraph>how do you choose between two top mba programs when you ve been admitted by both  tough problem to have  right  in a bloomberg businessweek article this week  clear admit co founder graham richmond provides mba applicants facing this desirable and yet real dilemma with sage advice on how to make the most strategic decision </paragraph>
    <paragraph>once they re in  applicants can ask tougher questions of school officials  richmond told bloomberg bw  for example  with your fate no longer in the hands of the admissions committee  you can go ahead and request that career services provide you with a list of alumni working in your target industry  he says  you can also take advantage of admitted students  weekends and alumni club gatherings in your area to get a better sense of the real school  he adds  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>admitted applicants should also avoid letting school rankings influence their decision unduly  richmond cautions  though rankings can still help identify up and coming schools  they shouldn t define your ultimate decision  he says   it takes a lot of courage to fly in the face of the rankings and go to the school that would be best for you   he told bloomberg bw  but it can be a mistake to start reconsidering your first choice school just because you get accepted at a higher ranked institution </paragraph>
    <paragraph>much more important than a school s ranking is how it will help you achieve your personal goals for the future  a great way to help determine which program will be most successful at placing you in the kind of job you want is to schedule informational interviews with dream employers to ask what they think of the programs you are deciding between  richmond suggests </paragraph>

  <title>mit sloan launches new management flight simulator focused on sustainability in the fish industry</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a management professor at the mit sloan school of management has created a new web based flight simulation to instruct mbas about the challenges of sustainably managing the fishing industry  and through the mit sloan teaching innovation resources  mstir  website  teachers and students everywhere can try it out for free </paragraph>
    <paragraph>called  fishbanks   the new flight simulator lets individuals or teams confront firsthand what it s like to be a leader in the fishing industry  having to balance the need to compete against the need to limit your total catch in order to sustain the fishery for future generations  designed by sloan professor john sterman  the game can be played in a single session or over the course of a semester  it was adapted and updated from a board game originally created by former mit sloan professor and alumnus dennis meadows </paragraph>
    <paragraph> management flight simulators such as fishbanks bring an experiential aspect to learning about complex systems   sterman  who also directs the mit system dynamics group  said in a statement   they have more impact than simply listening to a lecture or engaging in a case study discussion  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mstir website features other management flight simulators as well  including salt seller  a commodity pricing simulation  eclipsing the competition  a solar photovoltaic industry simulation  and the soon to be released platform wars  a video game industry simulation  free for anyone to use  each offers video user guides and online instructions for students as well as video teaching notes and slides covering all aspects of the simulation for faculty </paragraph>
    <paragraph>sloan s sterman has been developing management flight simulators since the     s and notes that mit has been a pioneer among business schools in the field of action learning  which comprises a key element in many mit sloan classes and laboratories </paragraph>
    <paragraph> deep  actionable knowledge and decision making skills develop when people have the chance to apply classroom theory in the real world with its messy complexity  time pressure and irreversible consequences   sterman says   but project based action learning in the field is not possible in settings where the stakes are high or the consequences of decisions unfold over years or decades  for many of the critical issues we face  simulation becomes the main way we can discover for ourselves how complex systems work and develop the management and leadership skills we need to succeed  </paragraph>

  <title>ucla anderson school of management adjusts international student application requirements</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the anderson school of management at ucla announced last week that it is evolving it application requirements for international applicants to reflect changing academic systems worldwide  specifically  anderson will now consider applicants with three year undergraduate degrees and also will admit some international applicants without toefl or ielts scores </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the changes  announced via a post on anderson s mba insider s blog  come as the volume of international applicants to graduate management programs continues to rise  according to data released recently by the graduate management admissions council  gmac   which owns the gmat  international applicants made up more than half     percent  of applicants to full time mba programs last year  and    percent of graduate business programs saw their international application volume grow </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we have seen more and more applicants with three year bachelor s degrees like the new european standard   read the mba insider blog  while the standard for graduate admission remains a four year degree or its equivalent  anderson s admissions office states that it will now use its discretion to admit candidates with three year undergraduate degrees provided their overall academic profile and application are strong enough </paragraph>
    <paragraph>likewise  anderson will continue to require a toefl or ielts score from most international applicants to demonstrate english fluency but will now allow for some exceptions   we will consider applications from those without toefl or ielts scores if the candidate earned a degree where the sole language of instruction was english   the mba insider blog read   this means that applicants from countries such as india and singapore no longer have to take the language test if they were schooled in english   the post continued  anderson will use a range of indicators   other verbal scores  essays  etc    to ensure that all members of the incoming class are completely fluent in english  and a toefl or ielts score remains  the best way for international applicants to ensure competitiveness in our evaluation process   the post stressed </paragraph>

  <title>stanford mba admissions director shares admissions tips in wall street journal interview</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the wall street journal this week ran excerpts from an interesting interview with derrick bolton  assistant dean and director of mba admissions at stanford university s graduate school of business  with an acceptance rate of just   percent for this fall s incoming class  stanford is one of the most competitive mba programs out there  so it pays to pay attention when bolton shares his thoughts on the application process </paragraph>
    <paragraph>bolton  himself a stanford grad  mba       revealed in the interview with the journal that his team will not put an application aside in the event that a prospective applicant s gmat score is below a certain number   that would rob us of a lot of talent   he says  his team uses the gmat as a helpful indicator of how prospective applicants can perform in the first year  but they take a holistic approach  reviewing each candidate from an academic  professional and personal perspective  of course  that places on candidates the difficult job of opening up and telling their whole story to a group of strangers  he adds  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to whether he thinks admissions consultants aid candidates in the admissions process  bolton acknowledged that some candidates look to consultants to provide coaching or guidance that they are in a unique position to deliver having worked with a wide range of other candidates  applicants should ask themselves   how can someone who doesn t know you help you be a more authentic version of yourself   bolton advises  he allows that consultants who are asking the right questions probably can do just that </paragraph>
    <paragraph>candidates can get too caught up worrying about scores and essays  he says  but instead they should spend more time thinking about who they ask to serve as references   they often think about it from the perspective of   i need to pick three references who show different aspects of my personality   not from the perspective of   i need to pick three people who are going to be my strongest advocates    bolton says </paragraph>
    <paragraph>as to the diversity of the stanford gsb class  bolton attributes it to the fact that he makes     individual decisions rather than checking boxes with regard to industry mix  gender or anything else   if i m doing my job well  in terms of bringing in people who think about the world in different ways  it necessarily will reflect itself in the check the box metrics   he says </paragraph>

  <title>stanford graduate school of business tops aspen institute s beyond grey pinstripes ranking</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>stanford graduate school of business  gsb  last week reclaimed the number one spot in the aspen institute s biennial beyond grey pinstripes rankings  an alternative ranking that compares business schools according to how well they teach mba students to look at the social  environmental and ethical impacts of business decisions  this year s rankings were released on september   st </paragraph>
    <paragraph> in all scoring categories used to determine the ranking  business schools have raised the bar   judith samuelson  executive director of the aspen institute business and society program  which conducted beyond grey pinstripes  said in a statement  she noted that there are more courses than ever before featuring content on social  ethical and environmental issues  more courses about the role of business as a positive agent for change and more research published by faculty on relevant topics  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>stanford gsb slipped to fourth place in the last beyond grey pinstripes ranking in       having held the top spot in      and       but the palo alto school rose to the top again this year as a result of having numerous course offerings with social and environmental content  additional courses that explicitly address the role of mainstream business in improving social and environmental conditions and an environment in which faculty feel free to explore social and environmental topics in their research </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the top    schools in this year s ranking were as follow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   stanford graduate school of business    york university  schulich school of business  canada     ie university  spain     notre dame  mendoza college of business    yale school of management    northwestern  kellogg school of management    university of michigan  ross school of business    cornell university  johnson graduate school of management    university of north carolina  kenan flagler business school     uc berkeley  haas school of business</paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a press release announcing the rankings  samuelson noted that the      survey represented the first opportunity since the global economic downturn to measure whether and how mba programs have changed their course content as a result   in the wake of the financial crisis we re seeing an increased willingness to address these issues   she said   that willingness is coming from a variety of factors  including student demand  faculty readiness and a desire on the part of business schools to clarify what exactly they re doing to prepare business leaders to serve the needs of society  such as job creation and energy conservation  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to be considered as part of the rankings  business schools were asked to submit detailed course descriptions and faculty research abstracts  as well as information about extracurricular activities  institutes and centers  joint degrees and specializations  for the           beyond grey pinstripes rankings      schools from    countries submitted data  the aspen institute project team spent seven months analyzing the data to arrive at the rankings </paragraph>

  <title>u penn s wharton school tests new team based discussion component for potential future inclusion in application process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>beginning this winter  some mba applicants to the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania will be randomly selected to take part in a discussion with fellow applicants as part of the application process  according to recent reports in the wall street journal and daily pennsylvanian  dp  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>this supplemental team based exercise will have no effect on admissions this year  according to ankur kumar  wharton director of mba admissions and financial aid  the new discussion format component is designed to help highlight applicants  interpersonal skills  intellectual curiosity  leadership  teamwork  problem solving and critical thinking  kumar told the dp  she hopes it will  actually bring to life off the page who  the candidates  are and showcase that to us   she added   the new discussion component will focus on applicants  general knowledge   not their business experience  kumar said  this year s test will help determine whether discussions will become a permanent fixture in the mba admissions process  she added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>wharton vice dean of innovation karl ulrich thinks wharton s current applications may not allow reliable assessment of applicants based on all qualities  according to the dp report   wharton receives enough applicants with excellent grades  work experience  and gmat scores to fill its class many times over   the team discussion format lets us observe and evaluate applicants in an unstructured format  which we believe will allow us to more reliably assess applicants   he wrote in an e mail to the dp </paragraph>
    <paragraph>students in past wharton mba classes have participated in mock discussions after admission to the mba class  the dp report added       wharton mba graduate ayo omojola participated in a discussion group featuring six to seven students discussing a general knowledge topic and seeking to reach consensus while admissions team observers watched  omojola told the dp that he thinks incorporating discussions into the admissions process will better allow the wharton admissions team to get to know candidates </paragraph>
    <paragraph>kumar stressed that the new discussion component should not contribute to any anxiety among current applicants since it is still in its initial testing stages </paragraph>
    <paragraph>clear admit s team of admissions specialists sees promise in the new wharton discussion component  which represents a major break from tradition  in which the application has been a one way dialog between the admissions committee and the applicant </paragraph>
    <paragraph> mckinsey uses the group interview method as a screening tool in final interview rounds   says clear admit senior admissions counselor stacey oyler  who worked in admissions at dartmouth s tuck school of business and as a recruiter for mckinsey before joining the clear admit team </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we ll keep tabs on these and other admissions developments and help applicants be as prepared as possible for any future changes  so be sure to watch this space </paragraph>

  <title>one year specialized master s degree application volume grows as mba volume declines</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>the number of prospective applicants to specialized master s programs in finance and management grew this year  even as mba application volume fell off at many schools  the graduate management admission council  gmac  reported this week </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to gmac s annual application trends survey  about two thirds of two year  full time mba programs reported decreases in application volume  on average  applications for these programs fell     percent over       but other mba programs   including the majority of part time and executive mba programs   reported that their application levels remained the same or rose in      as compared with       </paragraph>
    <paragraph>specialized master s programs  in contrast  experienced significant gains  eighty three percent of master s programs in finance report applications are up  followed by    percent of master s in management and    percent of master s in accounting programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a wall street journal article on application volumes attributed the increased application volume for these shorter  specialized programs to undergraduates hoping to increase their credentials before hitting the job market and to tougher entry requirements by professional certification boards  for example  the journal offered  students who want to become certified public accountants in certain states must now have     hours of college credit to qualify for the cpa exam  more than most get in an undergraduate program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but for full time programs  even the very top schools weren t immune to a drop off in application volume  applications to harvard business school  hbs  s full time mba program fell by   percent  to        from a year earlier </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  for prospective mba applicants  this news could mean that right now represents a great time to apply  the reduced application volume helped boost hbs s acceptance rate to    percent this year  up from    percent in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the mba applicant pool is also growing more and more international  the trends survey found  nearly half     percent  of the     business schools who participated reported an increase in the number of overseas students  most notably from india and china </paragraph>

    <paragraph>today s gmat tip comes from our friends at knewton    in       this article  they provide helpful advice on how to approach the awa section of the gmat   read on to see  what  they  have to say </paragraph>
    <paragraph>i want to take a moment to address some common confusion about the  analytical writing assessment  awa  portion of the gmat exam   as many  of you inveterate students know  the awa portion involves two essays   and you get a maximum of    minutes for each essay   and no  you don t  get    minutes for the second essay if the first only takes you     minutes   as i like to say    there are no rollover minutes   this is  verizon  not at t    also  the essays are always the first section  of the exam  although the ordering of the essays may vary </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but many of you also probably know that the essay portion is not  nearly as consequential as the multiple choice portions   the essays are  not part of your     composite score and are instead scored on  a separate scale out of     in decrements of       generally   admissions committees use the essay scores to judge whether or not you  actually wrote your application essays to the school   if you write a  fantastic admissions essay filled with prose worthy of a pulitzer but  get a     awa score  the admissions committee s going to be suspicious </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but in the end  your composite score out of     weighs much more  heavily on the committee s collective mind   it s easy  then  to come up  with arguments for blowing off the essay and focusing the bulk of your  attention on the multiple choice sections   but is this really wise </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one time  a student told me that he was going to take the gmat a  second time   the first time he took the test  he didn t achieve his  desired composite score   but he got a perfect     on the awa   so in  his mind  this justified the following strategy    i m going to  completely skip the essays the next time i take the test   it s not  important anyway  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several students have suggested similar strategies to me  and i  understood where they were coming from   skipping the essays outright  makes the test shorter and allows you to conserve some mental energy for  the multiple choice sections   but consider the following scenario    you re on the admissions committee of a prestigious business school    you re reviewing an applicant  and you see that he got a     awa on the  gmat on his first try  but got a     the second time   you don t like  the sight of the      and although you recognize that the applicant has  the capability to score a      it s readily apparent  at least in your  mind  that the applicant feels cocky or lax enough to blow a whole  section of the test off and just assume that it won t matter </paragraph>
    <paragraph>now  it may be true that some individual committees won t care as  much   but are you willing to take that risk   what if you re applying  to a competitive school that requires you to present every advantage you  can   allowing a     to show up on your transcript doesn t seem very  prudent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>besides  does the one hour of essay writing really drain you of so  much energy that it makes a statistically significant difference on your  performance for the rest of the test   you might assume the answer is  yes   but it s a pretty tenuous generalization   if you took the gmat  hundreds of times with the awa and hundreds of times without  maybe we d  have some statistical data to go on   but as is  assuming the awa will  take away your mojo so much that your score will drop by a significant  margin is unfounded speculation at best </paragraph>
    <paragraph>another thing to keep in mind   some students actually like the  essays  because they allow you to shake off initial nerves   you get the  least important part of the test out of the way first  and by the time  you re done  you ve settled into a groove and gotten used to your  surroundings   for some students  this allows them to transition into  the multiple choice sections more relaxed and clear minded   this might  be the case for you too </paragraph>
    <paragraph>so all in all  you might in theory be able to get away with blowing  off the essays   but all things considered  it s not a risk worth  taking  and a poor or nonexistent awa score will not look good to  admissions committees   the essays are the least consequential part of  the test  so investing just a little bit of time and energy in them  should not have a great effect on your composite score </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school admissions director provides assorted updates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in case you missed it  harvard business school  hbs  dean of admissions dee leopold provided an array of miscellaneous updates regarding the admissions process in a post to her director s blog last week  included was new information about transcripts  class visits and upcoming events  as well as information that leopold feels bears repeating with regard to letters of recommendation </paragraph>
    <paragraph>there has been a change this admissions season at hbs as far as transcripts are concerned  leopold reminded prospective applicants   we are requiring that all transcripts be uploaded this year   she wrote  that means no more templates for applicants to fill in their grades  the shift is intended to make verification after admission easier for hbs   yes  you can scan and upload   leopold wrote  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>she also called attention to the fact that there are still a couple of remaining information sessions in boston  los angeles and several international cities for prospective applicants hoping to learn more about hbs and the admissions process  these events  like others that have preceded them  will feature student and alumni panels  time for q a about admissions and more  for a full list of remaining information sessions and locations  click here </paragraph>
    <paragraph>leopold apologized that it is still hard to secure a spot for class visits despite the fact that hbs has opened up second year classes to visitors for the first time this year   i wish it were easier   she wrote   if you find yourself closed out of a class  it still may be worthwhile visiting  we ll have information sessions led by the admissions board  tours led by students and lots of places you can wander and strike up conversations with students  and really good food  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the news on recommendations is old  leopold simply wanted to reassure prospective applicants that hbs does not require recommendations from current supervisors   if it s possible  we strongly advise it  if it s not  just drop a brief explanation in the  additional information  section of the application   she wrote  she went on to add that though they don t ask for a peer rec  she acknowledges that they can be very important in some cases  such as when you re trying to tell the admissions committee about a venture you started in college or beyond  finally  for applicants who work for family businesses  leopold advised making your best call on how to handle it   it s rare that your mom or dad can be objective  although i ve certainly seen a few very frank ones   so you ll need to explore other options   she wrote  but she stressed that hbs likes having the family business perspective in the classroom  so applicants in this position should not let it deter them </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in closing  leopold challenged herself to add a new feature to her blog entries  namely a weekly interview with a current student  perhaps alternating between first and second years   i m going to be interviewing one person each week on thursday at    p m  and asking about their day  and what s ahead between now and bedtime   she wrote  the interviews will be posted on fridays starting in mid september </paragraph>
    <paragraph>we look forward to them </paragraph>

  <title>tuck school of business professor wins ama s excellence in marketing research award</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a professor of marketing at the tuck school of business at dartmouth university took home this year s excellence in global marketing research award from the american marketing association  ama   the school announced this week  professor peter golder received the award on august  th for a      journal of marketing research article introducing the concept of near market knowledge </paragraph>
    <paragraph>near market knowledge is a concept designed to help firms better understand market entry decisions by reflecting the knowledge they generate by operating in markets that are culturally and economically similar  the study s findings suggest that today s expanding companies should consider developing experience in foreign markets as a basis for entering other similar markets  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> entering foreign markets is a key component of the growth strategy of most firms   golder said in a statement  adding that many firms nonetheless fail in these efforts   the most successful companies leverage their experiences in other similar foreign markets  without such experiences  companies are better off gaining experience in smaller markets prior to entering larger  similar markets   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>for the purposes of the study  golder and co author debanjan mitra compiled extensive data on the foreign market entries of    multinational firms  the ama award recognizes golder as the author of an outstanding research article based on the long term impact of its findings </paragraph>

  <title>washington post story on mba admissions features clear admit</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in case you missed it  there was a great piece in both the print and online versions of the washington post this past weekend on mba admissions  the piece  entitled  would you climb any mountain to get into mba program of your dreams   ran in sunday s post and featured quotes and input from clear admit co founder graham richmond on how applicants to top mba programs can help make themselves stand out among the thousands and thousands of applications the very best schools receive </paragraph>
    <paragraph>one of the most important things is to understand who will be reading your application  richmond told the post   the people reading the file are more like your high school english teacher than the colleague sitting next to you at an investment bank   he said  adding that they are more interested in getting a good sense of who you are than your business experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>that s why richmond advised a recent applicant to wharton to write an essay about learning how to shoot guns in order to fit into the male dominated southern based private equity firm where she worked </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the post story focused on the intangibles   the things beyond gpa and gmat score that help demonstrate managerial  entrepreneurial and or social skills that can distinguish individual applicants   the intangibles are incredibly important   george andrews  associate dean at the university of chicago s booth school  told the post  adding that it s these qualities that also help admissions officers build a diverse class </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the post article also cited some of the strategies students have used to demonstrate these types of qualities  such as showcasing start ups or nonprofits they ve helped found or volunteer programs they ve participated with as part of their applications </paragraph>
    <paragraph>here  too  richmond provided some important advice to applicants  namely that you need to make sure that whatever you choose to highlight shows sincerity and commitment  in other words  picking up a last minute volunteer gig with a soup kitchen just before the application deadline may not carry much weight   the candidate who starts doing something right before application can look fishy   he told the post </paragraph>
    <paragraph>admissions officials from several top schools  including wharton  stanford and georgetown  also chimed in with useful pointers for prospective applicants  if you are currently applying to business school or considering applying in the near future  you ll probably want to check out the piece for yourself  to read it in its entirety  click here </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school offers visits to second year classes in september</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with the round   deadline for the class of      just    days away  harvard business school  hbs  has opted to open up a small number of second year classes to visitors in september  the traditional first year class visit program doesn t begin until october  after round   applicants will have submitted their applications </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we have always focused our class visit program on the first year classroom   wrote hbs dean of admissions and financial aid in a post to her director s blog   the downside of this is that our faculty like to let the new students settle in a bit before welcoming visitors  that doesn t dovetail very nicely with our october  rd application deadline   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>to give prospective round   applicants a chance to see an hbs class in order to assess whether they would like to apply  hbswill open up a limited number of spaces in second year classes for visitors in september   i think visitors will find this a great opportunity to see the case method in action   and get a glimpse of our second year students   leopold wrote </paragraph>
    <paragraph>of course  the entire hbs second year is an elective curriculum  versus the required curriculum that makes up the first year  and visitors to these classes will not see students in the    person sections that comprise the first year classes  for applicants to later rounds  first year class visits will resume on october  rd </paragraph>
    <paragraph>look for detailed instructions on how to arrange a second year class visit on the hbs website this week  leopold wrote  a fall schedule for information sessions and campus tours will be posted at the same time  she added </paragraph>

  <title>wharton vice dean of mba career management  admissions and financial aid leaves post</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a letter last week to current students at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  dean tom robertson shared that j j  cutler  deputy vice dean of mba career management  admissions and financial aid  will be leaving the school to take a senior management position at aramark   this is a wonderful opportunity for j j   and although we are  of course  sorry to see him go  we are confident that his active  integrative leadership and his cultivation of talented senior managers in the mba program administration have left us stronger than ever going forward   robertson wrote </paragraph>

    <paragraph>lamb brings more than    years of work experience both in the united states and europe  most notably as director at the capital group and vice president at jp morgan  cutler wrote  in her five years at wharton  lamb has been most focused on the finance  europe  veteran and jd mba communities and has consistently been the top rated student advisor </paragraph>
    <paragraph> this past year  as a member of the leadership team overseeing all mbacm advisors  maryellen led us to the highest student satisfaction scores in seven years  in part by implementing the net promoter score  nps  process which is measured after each advising appointment   cutler wrote  he added that lamb has also helped enhance wharton s recruiting strategy to increase opportunities for both students and employers  which has resulted in significant improvements in both the employment rate and average salary for the class of      </paragraph>

  <title>concerns about increasingly younger mba classes prove unfounded  financial times reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>with mba programs at schools like harvard business school  hbs  adopting deferred admissions programs designed to attract prospective college applicants  rumors have been circulating for the past several years that business schools are seeking to enroll younger classes  in fact  according to a recent article in the financial times  these rumors have proven misplaced and the average age of incoming students has hovered around    for most u s  two year programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the concern that business schools planned to enroll younger classes was sparked in great part by hbs s launch of its     program  which targets promising college students  who if accepted are guaranteed a spot in the hbs class after completing two years of approved work experience  this represents a shift from the average five years of experience that most top tier schools have usually wanted to see from applicants  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with its     program  hbs has hoped to attract bright young students earlier  before they venture down another career path or followed an alternate graduate school direction  schools have also argued that targeting younger students could help increase female enrollment  making the timeframe for attendance more analogous to law or medical school and less in conflict with the years when many women choose to start a family </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but despite concerns that     would result in a younger  less experienced class  a third of the first entries from the program  who will join hbs later this year  have decided to further defer business school  that leaves    participants from the program entering this year out of a class of     students  hbs dean of admissions and financial aid dee leopold told the ft that there were no strict rules about students joining in a given year and participants are welcome to work for additional years if they choose </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the simon school at the university of rochester  which also launched an  early leaders  initiative a few years ago  the average age has risen back to    after dipping to     at simon  the young leaders program is credited with increasing the number of female applicants  according to the ft report  about    per cent of those designated as young leaders are women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the increase in women entering top tier mba programs has been particularly significant this year at a range of schools  at hbs  the female students increased from    to    percent  and the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania tops the chart  with a    percent female intake this year  up from    percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>but at wharton  admissions officials maintain that significant work experience   including in managerial roles   is key to recruiters   all the feedback from employers is that they want work experience    j j  cutler  wharton director of mba admissions and financial aid  told the ft   we want a mature  diverse class   according to cutler     per cent of the class of     at wharton have four or more years of work experience </paragraph>
    <paragraph>despite its commitment to significant work experience  wharton has begun to talk to young women in high schools as well as colleges to persuade them of the value of a business education  dean tom robertson believes that having more women in the class this year will draw more women in subsequent years   there is a critical mass issue   he told the ft   women feel there is a critical mass of women  at wharton   </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>of the    students in imd s incoming mba class this year     will be women  the swtizerland school reports  though imd has always prided itself on its diverse class  this figure is a milestone </paragraph>
    <paragraph> when highly accomplished people from a broad range of backgrounds  perspectives and skill sets are brought together  they challenge each other and gain invaluable understanding of other points of view   claire lecoq  imd mba director of marketing  admissions and career services  said in a statement   we are so encouraged by the ever growing number and quality of women applicants  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the school  female participants  like their male counterparts  tend to be a bit older and bring more career experience than those in other mba programs  imd students on average are between    and    and have   to    years of professional experience before they begin the program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a recent post to the imd website  women of the      imd class shared what the imd mba program is like  in particular for women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>german british citizen saskia marsh  who has worked for the un in kosovo and gaza  thinks the imd mba is better rounded than many other programs    it gives you a solid grounding in the more traditional mba subjects of accounting  finance and operations while also exploring the more psychological elements of managing a business and becoming an effective leader   she said   women tend to look at the world in a multifaceted way and so this multidisciplinary approach is probably particularly attractive to female candidates  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the program makes no distinction between the men and women  not at all   said it business development professional kamini aisola  a dual citizen of india and the netherlands  she described the program as a leadership development  laboratory   an environment that requires all participants to be equally capable and committed  it wouldn t work  she said  if  the female male ratio were merely a diversity target exercise  </paragraph>

    <author>Admissions Tips</author>
  </authors>
  <title>admissions tip  using rankings to your advantage</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>there are numerous sources that can knowledgeably rank the  top  mba programs   however  because business schools receive different rankings depending on sources  criteria  it can be difficult to understand which are the  best  schools   therefore  today we d like to talk about how b school applicants can use rankings to discover the  best  schools for them   although the general merits of each school are important  we also believe that it is important for mba applicants to rank schools based on their individual needs and interests   we encourage applicants to use official mba school rankings in the following ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   use rankings to create a consensus  sources rarely have the exact same rankings as each other  and therefore trying to determine the  top    schools can be frustrating   however  it s best to compile these different sources of rankings to form a consensus regarding the top schools   for example  if your target program is consistently listed in the top     regardless of its individual ranking among different sources  you should feel confident that it is regarded as a top school by industry professionals and future employers   you may not be able to pinpoint the ultimate  number one  school  but you will be able to distinguish between the different tiers of schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   consider individual rankings  mba applicants should assess schools based on how they will help them gain what they want from their business school experiences   therefore we urge you to ask yourself what matters most to you in an mba program   some applicants may value strict adherence to the case method more than the amount or size of research centers  whereas other applicants may want a large number of diverse student organizations or a strong joint degree program   looking at the individual criteria from which rankings are calculated may help you judge business schools based on the specific factors that matter most to you   for example  if you are interested in entrepreneurship  then perhaps you should consider applying to an mba program with a strong program in this field  even if it receives lower scores in other areas especially if these areas are not a main concern for you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>    think about where you want to go after business school  in addition to considering what you want to get out of your business school experience  you should think about how business school will help you pursue your future career   therefore  some important rankings to consider may be the number of internships students gain at a particular mba program  or how many recruiters from different fields visit specific campuses   these rankings may be especially important if you need to follow a specific career path to achieve your career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to studying rankings  we encourage b school applicants to do further research in understanding the comparable merits of business schools  such as perusing admissions information  talking to professors and students  and visiting campuses  furthermore  we encourage applicants to check out our clear admit school guides  which offer detailed profiles of the leading mba programs   best of luck to those researching business schools </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>since the credit crisis  international students have faced harder times obtaining student loans for graduate management education  in response  three insead alumni have established an innovative community education bond that calls on business school alumni to invest in their successors  the financial times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>founded by insead alumni cameron stevens  ryan steele and miha zerko  prodigy finance is a standalone organization providing an alternative for financing to the credit unions and other solutions some schools have turned to for their overseas students  prodigy s lending model is based around persuading insead alumni to invest in their successors by putting money into the community education bond  based on a predictive approach that takes into account students  potential earnings  the model helps reduce risks to investors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>investors get a good rate of return  and the system works because students don t want to default on loans that have originated with alumni  stevens told the ft   we outperform fixed deposits and the ftse   stevens said  noting that investors get the base rate of return plus   per cent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy lent     m in      and plans to lend nearly double that in       according to the ft report  the company plans to launch an extended platform with other business schools next january that could see total loans of    m next year  already  the company works with vlerick leuven gent management school in belgium and skolkovo in moscow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy is one of a few organizations looking for solutions that work across business schools  in the united states  kevin moehn  a consultant to the higher education funding market  is also developing a standalone product for international students in the u s   the need is still there  i have not seen in the market a broad based non co signed loan for international students   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some u s  schools  including the university of chicago booth school of business and northwestern s kellogg school of management  have joined a program with deutsche bank brokered by the graduate management admissions council  which administers the gmat  this program  which moehn helped design  allows international students to receive loans without a u s  co signer by making the schools the de facto co signer  according to stacey kole  deputy dean for the full time mba program at booth  about    percent of international students at booth take advantage of the program  which is known as alps   affiliated loan program for students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  other u s  business schools  such as the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  the darden school at the university of virginia and the haas school at uc berkeley have turned to nonprofit credit unions to finance international student loans </paragraph>

  <title>tech firms among most desired employers for mbas from top schools  survey shows</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a new survey finds that mba students from top firms are naming more technologies firms as their most desired places to work  the wall street journal reported this week </paragraph>

    <paragraph>nonetheless  consulting firms still hold quite a bit of sway  about    percent of students named mckinsey   co   which took the top spot  bain   co  and the boston consulting group were also in the top     major banks  such as goldman sachs and morgan stanley  continue to be top draws  even though opportunities in sales and trading functions at these types of firms have decreased  as a result  some career counselors say more students have been gravitating toward smaller firms  such as hedge funds and private equity firms  according to the journal report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russ hagey  world wide chief talent officer for bain   co   says he has seen increased competition for students   top talent is thinking about their resume and about where they re going to be challenged and excited  which i think might explain some of the tech companies on the list   he told the journal </paragraph>

    <paragraph>the hills plaza building was selected in part because  it  is  located in the soma neighborhood of the city  to ensure that wharton san francisco remains in an area known for innovation and entrepreneurship   wharton west vice dean doug collum told the daily pennsylvanian </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new location will be    percent larger than the existing campus space and accommodate as many as     students  up from    currently  the wall street journal reports  collom told the journal that plans to add a full time mba counterpart at the new wharton west are  on the drawing board  </paragraph>

  <title>insead to offer u s  mba program  poetsandquants reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>insead  a leading business school with campuses in fontainebleau  france  and singapore  has plans to offer an mba program in the united states  according to a recent report in poetsandquants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the details of the program are not yet clear   but we will offer some degree  either the mba or the executive mba   insead dean dipak jain told pandq   we are not sure whether we would do it alone or with someone  but definitely we want to increase our presence in the u s  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through a    year alliance with the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  insead has provided opportunities for mba student and faculty exchanges between the two schools  and it has also offered some joint executive education programs  but that has been the limit of its u s  offerings until now </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pandq report points out that an insead mba program in the u s   especially were it to follow the model of its european and asian format requiring just    months to complete the degree  would present significant competition to existing top tier mba programs in the u s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his interview with pandq  jain suggested that a deeper alliance with wharton or a standalone insead campus in the u s  were both possibilities  over the course of insead s alliance with wharton  more than       mba students have participated in the exchange program between the two schools  according to the pandq report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jain  who served as dean of northwestern s kellogg school of management from      to       succeeded insead dean frank brown in march  in his interview with pandq  he noted that the partnership with wharton has been important in allowing the u s  school to assess the quality of insead faculty and students over the past decade   they have to feel that we have the same quality they have   he said   in that sense  it has been a very good thing  now the next step is how do we take the relationship forward  </paragraph>

  <title>mba programs could see decline in applications for second year  poets quants reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>applications to full time mba programs at top business schools are expected to decline for a second consecutive year even as the job outlook for graduates continues to improve  according to poets quants  p q  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>p q interviewed peter von loesecke  chief executive of the mba tour  which organizes trips with business school admissions staff throughout the country and the world to provide information to potential mba applicants  loesecke estimates that schools with large numbers of applicants are down between   and    percent based on conversations he has had with admissions officials at more than two dozen schools over the past three months  p q reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applications for this year s incoming class fell by   percent at harvard business school  which released preliminary class profile information last week  last fall  stanford director of admissions derrick bolton was predicting that applications could drop by as much as    percent at top schools this year  p q reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph> applications are down in particular because people are having a hard time justifying the investment   loesecke told p q   part time programs may be a better alternative for them because they can hold down their jobs and not have to go through the pain of a job transition   he added that mounting debt is another concern  especially for prospective mba applicants who still have undergraduate loans to repay </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the same time  more and more current mba graduates are finding jobs faster and reporting increased satisfaction with schools  career services offerings  according to a new global survey by the mba tour  according to the survey s findings  more than a quarter of      mba graduates from u s  programs said job prospects were worse than they had been for the previous graduating class of       that number dropped to     percent in      and to zero for those graduating this year </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school admits more women  fewer finance candidates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  earlier this month released a preliminary profile for the class of       revealing a record number of women in the fall entering class and a notable drop in admits from private equity and finance backgrounds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>women will make up    percent of the incoming class  the highest in the school s history and an increase of   percentage points over each of the past two years  the percentage of admits from private equity and investment banking backgrounds  meanwhile  fell     and   percentage points respectively  overall  finance types will make up    percent of the fall entering class  representing a small but significant shift for a school where class makeup doesn t often change much from year to year  candidates with manufacturing backgrounds gained ground and will make up    percent of the entering class  up from just nine percent last year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a recent poetsandquants piece attributes the shifts to the new hbs dean  dean nitin nohria  noting that many believe the school now  appears to be favoring a more diverse set of applicants from manufacturing  healthcare  the military  the government  and non profits over those from such financial powerhouses as goldman sachs  kkr  and blackstone  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>p q went on to note that the shift away from finance could have ripple effects at other top tier schools  especially those that tend to admit more finance candidates  such as wharton  columbia  and chicago booth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in other hbs class profile news  the median graduate management admissions test  gmat  score rose this year to      breaking last year s record high of      the overall number of applicants fell slightly  from       to        and the class size increased slightly  from     to      resulting in a slightly higher admissions rate     percent as compared to    percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs is the first of the top tier business schools to share class of      profile data  the school did note when it released the information that it was accurate as of june          and is subject to change </paragraph>

    <paragraph>romer joins the stern faculty after serving this year as a visiting professor   paul s work on urbanization is a perfect fit for stern   dean peter henry said in a statement   he demonstrates what we expect our students to do  look for the big challenges  attack them with the methods and mindset of basic science  and create value for business and society  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>romer is recognized for his contributions to new growth theory  which puts new technologies at the center of economic growth  but in his more recent work  he emphasizes that technologies are only part of the story  adding that to make real progress societies must keep developing better rules to structure how people work together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>under romer s leadership  nyu stern s urban system project will treat the city as a distinct unit of analysis between the nation and the business  the new initiative is especially relevant now given that more people will move into cities in this century than in all of history to date  by studying this process  scholars hope to consider alternative paths it could follow   this kind of perspective encourages us to ask new questions   romer said   what would happen if we had more start up cities  why do we have schools of urban planning but don t have schools of business planning or national planning  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>romer s contributions regarding new cities and development were influenced by years of work with nobel laureate michael spence  a stern faculty member  and dean henry   it will be great to be able to work again at the same school with mike and peter   romer said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a member of the faculty at the stanford graduate school of business since       romer has also taught at taught at the university of california  berkeley  the university of chicago  and the university of rochester </paragraph>

  <title>u penn s wharton school to use staff  students to conduct admissions candidate interviews</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a letter to wharton mba alumni admissions volunteers  wharton deputy director of mba admissions and financial aid ankur kumar this week shared several planned changes to the school s alumni admissions volunteer program designed to enhance recruitment and improve alumni engagement  most notably  alumni will no longer conduct admissions interviews  freeing them up for other roles in the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph> beginning this year  wharton will take candidate interviews  in house    wrote kumar  meaning that the school will use staff and students to conduct interviews rather than alumni  going forward  all candidates will have the option of interviewing on campus with a trained student admissions fellow or at an increased number of domestic and international hub locations with admissions committee staff </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the decision to use staff and students in lieu of alumni reflects several key considerations  according to kumar  including the fact that applicants seem to want to engage more informally with alumni at other points during the admissions process and that alumni find that interviews limit their ability to share their experiences at wharton and beyond </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we believe our new interview arrangements will actually demonstrate an increased commitment to international applicants  and will guarantee a more consistent delivery of the interview structure across thousands of interviewees worldwide   kumar added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>instead of relying on alumni volunteers as part of the interview process  wharton will now call on them to help enhance the admissions recruitment process and the enrollment of admitted candidates  to this end  wharton will launch a new  alumni candidate appraisal portal  an online platform where alumni will be able to provide supplemental constructive input on candidates  which will be sent directly to the deputy director of the admissions committee and included in the candidate s file for review  the school will also sponsor more alumni led recruiting events to take advantage of alumni knowledge of markets around the world and connect influential alumni with admitted students during the enrollment decision process through welcome events and other programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> bringing the right students to wharton shapes the reach and impact of the school  today and as we look toward the future   said kumar   these programs capitalize on the strength of our alumni and the alumni network to ensure this happens   she continued </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley s haas school phases out certificate program  introduces areas of emphasis</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in last week s trivia tuesday  we discussed the certificate program at the university of california at berkeley s haas school of business  through which students can receive formal recognition for in depth study in each of five key areas  entrepreneurship  global management  health management  technology and real estate  we have since learned that haas is in the process of phasing out its certificate programs and instead will feature several new  areas of emphasis   which it will help students to develop </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the haas faculty voted in favor of the shift at its concluding faculty meeting last semester  in part because very few haas students take advantage of the existing certificate option and also because the five areas captured by the program failed to encompass the many areas in which haas has deep strengths </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if you think about it  by establishing a program in some areas and not in other areas  you are implicitly saying you shouldn t come to haas if you are interested in an area not covered by our certificate program   dan sullivan  haas director of academic services  said as part of a webinar for prospective applicants about the changes   we have deep strengths in a lot of areas not covered   he continued  including finance  strategy consulting  marketing and energy clean tech   the shift toward areas of emphasis was motivated in large part by a desire to better represent our offerings in the career paths that our students actually follow   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new areas of emphasis will allow full time haas mba students to focus their studies on an expanded number of in depth academic areas  in place of the five certificate programs  haas students can now select from nearly a dozen areas of emphasis designed to provide direction in achieving specific career goals  the current areas of emphasis include finance  marketing  strategy consulting  corporate social responsibility  energy and clean technology  entrepreneurship  global management  health management  nonprofit and public leadership  real estate and technology </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in place of a list of required courses that students had to complete to receive a certificate  the new areas of emphasis will consist of a series of recommended courses complemented by extracurricular activities and summer internship options designed to help students prepare for career paths in a wider range of industries   we reviewed this with recruiters before we made this change and they agreed   haas recruiting director lisa feldman said in the webinar   we are confident that it is going to work out for the career search   she added </paragraph>

  <title>u s  business schools see sluggish growth in international applications</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>as competition heats up overseas  u s  graduate business programs are having a harder time drawing international applicants  according to a recent article in the wall street journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the journal article cited findings from a recent survey by the washington  dc based council of graduate schools  which found that international applications for the      fall semester at the    u s  schools that award the largest number of degrees to international students fell by   percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  international applications to all american business schools rose by   percent  but that figure  too  was low compared to the    percent growth in international applicants to u s  graduate programs in engineering and physical and earth sciences  the survey found  in fact  international applications to graduate programs in all other disciplines rose by more than they did in business    percent in education    percent in arts and humanities    percent in life sciences and   percent in social sciences and psychology </paragraph>
    <paragraph> schools throughout europe  asia and australia have made huge investments in graduation education in general more specifically  business school   james wimbush  dean of indiana university s kelley school of business  told the journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>test taking data from the graduate management admissions council  gmac  supports the findings of the council of graduate schools  gmac  which owns the graduate management admissions test  gmat  entrance exam for business school programs  reports that it sent less that    percent of its scores to u s  schools in test year       which ended last june     compared with    percent in test year       over the same period  the total number of exam scores sent grew from         to          furthermore  non u s  citizens taking the gmat outnumbered u s  citizens for the first time ever in test year       and again in test year      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the journal report also noted that u s  schools have slipped in some rankings recently  in the financial times s most recent rankings of global mba programs  for example  american schools held    of the top    spots in       down from    in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several factors are at play in the sluggish international application rates at u s  schools  according to julia tyler  an executive vice president at gmac  there are an increasing number of programs available worldwide  and more test takers from india  western europe and elsewhere are opting to attend programs in their home countries or regions  she says </paragraph>

  <title>how to assign an appropriate role to rankings in the mba admissions process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit co founder graham richmond was recently featured in an article by bloomberg businessweek focusing on the role of rankings in the mba application process  in his interview with bbw  richmond advised prospective applicants that rankings can indeed play a valuable role in the school selection process  but that it s a role that has its limits </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the rankings are an initial step  but you have to go further   richmond told bbw   the ranking doesn t tell you the full story of what life is like on that campus or what a school is actually doing to place students in a particular industry   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it was for precisely this reason that clear admit launched its line of school guides  in depth profiles of each of the top mba programs  complete with program and curriculum specifics  admissions requirements and tips  career placement statistics and interviews with students and alumni to help reveal a given school s culture and community  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rankings can provide a valuable starting point  especially if candidates use the data they contain to create a personalized list of programs that meet some of their individual criteria  richmond told bbw  candidates can even input the data into a spreadsheet and include the items most important from each  he offered  richmond told bbw that he considers the bloomberg businessweek  u s  news and financial times rankings the most respected in the industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after creating their own list of programs  applicants can then layer in information from the specialty rankings that many media outlets produce to focus specifically on how given schools measure up with regard to their particular career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with this foundation  candidates are then well prepared to begin more thorough research into each program  including reviewing detailed guides to the school  visiting the campus and talking to current students  faculty and alumni </paragraph>
    <paragraph>admissions directors and deans from several top mba programs also contributed to the bbw article  sharing richmond s view that rankings should play a limited role in the overall process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> use rankings to figure out where to apply   sara neher  assistant dean for mba admissions at the university of virginia s darden school of business  told bbw   don t use them to decide where to go   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>judy d  olian  dean of the ucla anderson school of management  also stressed the importance of conducting significant research beyond the rankings   the rankings should be a factor but a small factor   she told bbw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>whatever you do  do not discuss the rankings in your applications  richmond stresses  admissions committees want to see that you have done your research and really see their school as a place where you can see yourself enrolled  not that you are applying simply because the school is no    on a certain publication s annual list </paragraph>
