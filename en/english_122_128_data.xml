  <title>switzerland s imd enrolls a record number of women</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>of the    students in imd s incoming mba class this year     will be women  the swtizerland school reports  though imd has always prided itself on its diverse class  this figure is a milestone </paragraph>
    <paragraph> when highly accomplished people from a broad range of backgrounds  perspectives and skill sets are brought together  they challenge each other and gain invaluable understanding of other points of view   claire lecoq  imd mba director of marketing  admissions and career services  said in a statement   we are so encouraged by the ever growing number and quality of women applicants  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>according to the school  female participants  like their male counterparts  tend to be a bit older and bring more career experience than those in other mba programs  imd students on average are between    and    and have   to    years of professional experience before they begin the program </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in a recent post to the imd website  women of the      imd class shared what the imd mba program is like  in particular for women </paragraph>
    <paragraph>german british citizen saskia marsh  who has worked for the un in kosovo and gaza  thinks the imd mba is better rounded than many other programs    it gives you a solid grounding in the more traditional mba subjects of accounting  finance and operations while also exploring the more psychological elements of managing a business and becoming an effective leader   she said   women tend to look at the world in a multifaceted way and so this multidisciplinary approach is probably particularly attractive to female candidates  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the program makes no distinction between the men and women  not at all   said it business development professional kamini aisola  a dual citizen of india and the netherlands  she described the program as a leadership development  laboratory   an environment that requires all participants to be equally capable and committed  it wouldn t work  she said  if  the female male ratio were merely a diversity target exercise  </paragraph>

  <title>admissions tip  using rankings to your advantage</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>there are numerous sources that can knowledgeably rank the  top  mba programs   however  because business schools receive different rankings depending on sources  criteria  it can be difficult to understand which are the  best  schools   therefore  today we d like to talk about how b school applicants can use rankings to discover the  best  schools for them   although the general merits of each school are important  we also believe that it is important for mba applicants to rank schools based on their individual needs and interests   we encourage applicants to use official mba school rankings in the following ways </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   use rankings to create a consensus  sources rarely have the exact same rankings as each other  and therefore trying to determine the  top    schools can be frustrating   however  it s best to compile these different sources of rankings to form a consensus regarding the top schools   for example  if your target program is consistently listed in the top     regardless of its individual ranking among different sources  you should feel confident that it is regarded as a top school by industry professionals and future employers   you may not be able to pinpoint the ultimate  number one  school  but you will be able to distinguish between the different tiers of schools </paragraph>
    <paragraph>   consider individual rankings  mba applicants should assess schools based on how they will help them gain what they want from their business school experiences   therefore we urge you to ask yourself what matters most to you in an mba program   some applicants may value strict adherence to the case method more than the amount or size of research centers  whereas other applicants may want a large number of diverse student organizations or a strong joint degree program   looking at the individual criteria from which rankings are calculated may help you judge business schools based on the specific factors that matter most to you   for example  if you are interested in entrepreneurship  then perhaps you should consider applying to an mba program with a strong program in this field  even if it receives lower scores in other areas especially if these areas are not a main concern for you </paragraph>
    <paragraph>    think about where you want to go after business school  in addition to considering what you want to get out of your business school experience  you should think about how business school will help you pursue your future career   therefore  some important rankings to consider may be the number of internships students gain at a particular mba program  or how many recruiters from different fields visit specific campuses   these rankings may be especially important if you need to follow a specific career path to achieve your career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in addition to studying rankings  we encourage b school applicants to do further research in understanding the comparable merits of business schools  such as perusing admissions information  talking to professors and students  and visiting campuses  furthermore  we encourage applicants to check out our clear admit school guides  which offer detailed profiles of the leading mba programs   best of luck to those researching business schools </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>since the credit crisis  international students have faced harder times obtaining student loans for graduate management education  in response  three insead alumni have established an innovative community education bond that calls on business school alumni to invest in their successors  the financial times reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>founded by insead alumni cameron stevens  ryan steele and miha zerko  prodigy finance is a standalone organization providing an alternative for financing to the credit unions and other solutions some schools have turned to for their overseas students  prodigy s lending model is based around persuading insead alumni to invest in their successors by putting money into the community education bond  based on a predictive approach that takes into account students  potential earnings  the model helps reduce risks to investors </paragraph>
    <paragraph>investors get a good rate of return  and the system works because students don t want to default on loans that have originated with alumni  stevens told the ft   we outperform fixed deposits and the ftse   stevens said  noting that investors get the base rate of return plus   per cent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy lent     m in      and plans to lend nearly double that in       according to the ft report  the company plans to launch an extended platform with other business schools next january that could see total loans of    m next year  already  the company works with vlerick leuven gent management school in belgium and skolkovo in moscow </paragraph>
    <paragraph>prodigy is one of a few organizations looking for solutions that work across business schools  in the united states  kevin moehn  a consultant to the higher education funding market  is also developing a standalone product for international students in the u s   the need is still there  i have not seen in the market a broad based non co signed loan for international students   he told the ft </paragraph>
    <paragraph>some u s  schools  including the university of chicago booth school of business and northwestern s kellogg school of management  have joined a program with deutsche bank brokered by the graduate management admissions council  which administers the gmat  this program  which moehn helped design  allows international students to receive loans without a u s  co signer by making the schools the de facto co signer  according to stacey kole  deputy dean for the full time mba program at booth  about    percent of international students at booth take advantage of the program  which is known as alps   affiliated loan program for students </paragraph>
    <paragraph>meanwhile  other u s  business schools  such as the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  the darden school at the university of virginia and the haas school at uc berkeley have turned to nonprofit credit unions to finance international student loans </paragraph>

  <title>tech firms among most desired employers for mbas from top schools  survey shows</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>a new survey finds that mba students from top firms are naming more technologies firms as their most desired places to work  the wall street journal reported this week </paragraph>

    <paragraph>this represents a rise in popularity for these firms  the journal reports  no    ranked amazon com inc  was chosen by      percent of students this year  compared to   percent in       for example  at the seattle based online retail giant  many mba graduates take roles as operations managers and financial analysts   we ve hired hundreds of mba students over the past year and expect to hire hundreds more in the year ahead   an amazon spokesperson said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>nonetheless  consulting firms still hold quite a bit of sway  about    percent of students named mckinsey   co   which took the top spot  bain   co  and the boston consulting group were also in the top     major banks  such as goldman sachs and morgan stanley  continue to be top draws  even though opportunities in sales and trading functions at these types of firms have decreased  as a result  some career counselors say more students have been gravitating toward smaller firms  such as hedge funds and private equity firms  according to the journal report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>russ hagey  world wide chief talent officer for bain   co   says he has seen increased competition for students   top talent is thinking about their resume and about where they re going to be challenged and excited  which i think might explain some of the tech companies on the list   he told the journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the universum survey included responses from       business school students from    schools between december and march  at the request of journal  universum narrowed the responses to       from students attending    highly ranked schools </paragraph>

  <title>insead to offer u s  mba program  poetsandquants reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>insead  a leading business school with campuses in fontainebleau  france  and singapore  has plans to offer an mba program in the united states  according to a recent report in poetsandquants </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the details of the program are not yet clear   but we will offer some degree  either the mba or the executive mba   insead dean dipak jain told pandq   we are not sure whether we would do it alone or with someone  but definitely we want to increase our presence in the u s  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>through a    year alliance with the university of pennsylvania s wharton school  insead has provided opportunities for mba student and faculty exchanges between the two schools  and it has also offered some joint executive education programs  but that has been the limit of its u s  offerings until now </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the pandq report points out that an insead mba program in the u s   especially were it to follow the model of its european and asian format requiring just    months to complete the degree  would present significant competition to existing top tier mba programs in the u s </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in his interview with pandq  jain suggested that a deeper alliance with wharton or a standalone insead campus in the u s  were both possibilities  over the course of insead s alliance with wharton  more than       mba students have participated in the exchange program between the two schools  according to the pandq report </paragraph>
    <paragraph>jain  who served as dean of northwestern s kellogg school of management from      to       succeeded insead dean frank brown in march  in his interview with pandq  he noted that the partnership with wharton has been important in allowing the u s  school to assess the quality of insead faculty and students over the past decade   they have to feel that we have the same quality they have   he said   in that sense  it has been a very good thing  now the next step is how do we take the relationship forward  </paragraph>

  <title>mba programs could see decline in applications for second year  poets quants reports</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>applications to full time mba programs at top business schools are expected to decline for a second consecutive year even as the job outlook for graduates continues to improve  according to poets quants  p q  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>p q interviewed peter von loesecke  chief executive of the mba tour  which organizes trips with business school admissions staff throughout the country and the world to provide information to potential mba applicants  loesecke estimates that schools with large numbers of applicants are down between   and    percent based on conversations he has had with admissions officials at more than two dozen schools over the past three months  p q reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph>applications for this year s incoming class fell by   percent at harvard business school  which released preliminary class profile information last week  last fall  stanford director of admissions derrick bolton was predicting that applications could drop by as much as    percent at top schools this year  p q reports </paragraph>
    <paragraph> applications are down in particular because people are having a hard time justifying the investment   loesecke told p q   part time programs may be a better alternative for them because they can hold down their jobs and not have to go through the pain of a job transition   he added that mounting debt is another concern  especially for prospective mba applicants who still have undergraduate loans to repay </paragraph>
    <paragraph>at the same time  more and more current mba graduates are finding jobs faster and reporting increased satisfaction with schools  career services offerings  according to a new global survey by the mba tour  according to the survey s findings  more than a quarter of      mba graduates from u s  programs said job prospects were worse than they had been for the previous graduating class of       that number dropped to     percent in      and to zero for those graduating this year </paragraph>

  <title>harvard business school admits more women  fewer finance candidates</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>harvard business school  hbs  earlier this month released a preliminary profile for the class of       revealing a record number of women in the fall entering class and a notable drop in admits from private equity and finance backgrounds </paragraph>
    <paragraph>women will make up    percent of the incoming class  the highest in the school s history and an increase of   percentage points over each of the past two years  the percentage of admits from private equity and investment banking backgrounds  meanwhile  fell     and   percentage points respectively  overall  finance types will make up    percent of the fall entering class  representing a small but significant shift for a school where class makeup doesn t often change much from year to year  candidates with manufacturing backgrounds gained ground and will make up    percent of the entering class  up from just nine percent last year  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a recent poetsandquants piece attributes the shifts to the new hbs dean  dean nitin nohria  noting that many believe the school now  appears to be favoring a more diverse set of applicants from manufacturing  healthcare  the military  the government  and non profits over those from such financial powerhouses as goldman sachs  kkr  and blackstone  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>p q went on to note that the shift away from finance could have ripple effects at other top tier schools  especially those that tend to admit more finance candidates  such as wharton  columbia  and chicago booth </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in other hbs class profile news  the median graduate management admissions test  gmat  score rose this year to      breaking last year s record high of      the overall number of applicants fell slightly  from       to        and the class size increased slightly  from     to      resulting in a slightly higher admissions rate     percent as compared to    percent last year </paragraph>
    <paragraph>hbs is the first of the top tier business schools to share class of      profile data  the school did note when it released the information that it was accurate as of june          and is subject to change </paragraph>

  <title>noted urban economist joins nyu stern school of business faculty</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>paul romer  a world renowned economist specializing in urbanization and development  will join the faculty of the new york university  nyu  stern school of business in fall       the school announced last week  romer will lead nyu stern s urban system project  a new initiative the school is launching with a     million gift </paragraph>
    <paragraph>romer joins the stern faculty after serving this year as a visiting professor   paul s work on urbanization is a perfect fit for stern   dean peter henry said in a statement   he demonstrates what we expect our students to do  look for the big challenges  attack them with the methods and mindset of basic science  and create value for business and society  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>romer is recognized for his contributions to new growth theory  which puts new technologies at the center of economic growth  but in his more recent work  he emphasizes that technologies are only part of the story  adding that to make real progress societies must keep developing better rules to structure how people work together </paragraph>
    <paragraph>under romer s leadership  nyu stern s urban system project will treat the city as a distinct unit of analysis between the nation and the business  the new initiative is especially relevant now given that more people will move into cities in this century than in all of history to date  by studying this process  scholars hope to consider alternative paths it could follow   this kind of perspective encourages us to ask new questions   romer said   what would happen if we had more start up cities  why do we have schools of urban planning but don t have schools of business planning or national planning  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>romer s contributions regarding new cities and development were influenced by years of work with nobel laureate michael spence  a stern faculty member  and dean henry   it will be great to be able to work again at the same school with mike and peter   romer said in a statement </paragraph>
    <paragraph>a member of the faculty at the stanford graduate school of business since       romer has also taught at taught at the university of california  berkeley  the university of chicago  and the university of rochester </paragraph>

  <title>u penn s wharton school to use staff  students to conduct admissions candidate interviews</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in a letter to wharton mba alumni admissions volunteers  wharton deputy director of mba admissions and financial aid ankur kumar this week shared several planned changes to the school s alumni admissions volunteer program designed to enhance recruitment and improve alumni engagement  most notably  alumni will no longer conduct admissions interviews  freeing them up for other roles in the admissions process </paragraph>
    <paragraph> beginning this year  wharton will take candidate interviews  in house    wrote kumar  meaning that the school will use staff and students to conduct interviews rather than alumni  going forward  all candidates will have the option of interviewing on campus with a trained student admissions fellow or at an increased number of domestic and international hub locations with admissions committee staff </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the decision to use staff and students in lieu of alumni reflects several key considerations  according to kumar  including the fact that applicants seem to want to engage more informally with alumni at other points during the admissions process and that alumni find that interviews limit their ability to share their experiences at wharton and beyond </paragraph>
    <paragraph> we believe our new interview arrangements will actually demonstrate an increased commitment to international applicants  and will guarantee a more consistent delivery of the interview structure across thousands of interviewees worldwide   kumar added </paragraph>
    <paragraph>instead of relying on alumni volunteers as part of the interview process  wharton will now call on them to help enhance the admissions recruitment process and the enrollment of admitted candidates  to this end  wharton will launch a new  alumni candidate appraisal portal  an online platform where alumni will be able to provide supplemental constructive input on candidates  which will be sent directly to the deputy director of the admissions committee and included in the candidate s file for review  the school will also sponsor more alumni led recruiting events to take advantage of alumni knowledge of markets around the world and connect influential alumni with admitted students during the enrollment decision process through welcome events and other programs </paragraph>
    <paragraph> bringing the right students to wharton shapes the reach and impact of the school  today and as we look toward the future   said kumar   these programs capitalize on the strength of our alumni and the alumni network to ensure this happens   she continued </paragraph>

  <title>uc berkeley s haas school phases out certificate program  introduces areas of emphasis</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>in last week s trivia tuesday  we discussed the certificate program at the university of california at berkeley s haas school of business  through which students can receive formal recognition for in depth study in each of five key areas  entrepreneurship  global management  health management  technology and real estate  we have since learned that haas is in the process of phasing out its certificate programs and instead will feature several new  areas of emphasis   which it will help students to develop </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the haas faculty voted in favor of the shift at its concluding faculty meeting last semester  in part because very few haas students take advantage of the existing certificate option and also because the five areas captured by the program failed to encompass the many areas in which haas has deep strengths </paragraph>
    <paragraph> if you think about it  by establishing a program in some areas and not in other areas  you are implicitly saying you shouldn t come to haas if you are interested in an area not covered by our certificate program   dan sullivan  haas director of academic services  said as part of a webinar for prospective applicants about the changes   we have deep strengths in a lot of areas not covered   he continued  including finance  strategy consulting  marketing and energy clean tech   the shift toward areas of emphasis was motivated in large part by a desire to better represent our offerings in the career paths that our students actually follow   he said </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the new areas of emphasis will allow full time haas mba students to focus their studies on an expanded number of in depth academic areas  in place of the five certificate programs  haas students can now select from nearly a dozen areas of emphasis designed to provide direction in achieving specific career goals  the current areas of emphasis include finance  marketing  strategy consulting  corporate social responsibility  energy and clean technology  entrepreneurship  global management  health management  nonprofit and public leadership  real estate and technology </paragraph>
    <paragraph>in place of a list of required courses that students had to complete to receive a certificate  the new areas of emphasis will consist of a series of recommended courses complemented by extracurricular activities and summer internship options designed to help students prepare for career paths in a wider range of industries   we reviewed this with recruiters before we made this change and they agreed   haas recruiting director lisa feldman said in the webinar   we are confident that it is going to work out for the career search   she added </paragraph>

  <text>
    <paragraph>as competition heats up overseas  u s  graduate business programs are having a harder time drawing international applicants  according to a recent article in the wall street journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the journal article cited findings from a recent survey by the washington  dc based council of graduate schools  which found that international applications for the      fall semester at the    u s  schools that award the largest number of degrees to international students fell by   percent </paragraph>
    <paragraph>overall  international applications to all american business schools rose by   percent  but that figure  too  was low compared to the    percent growth in international applicants to u s  graduate programs in engineering and physical and earth sciences  the survey found  in fact  international applications to graduate programs in all other disciplines rose by more than they did in business    percent in education    percent in arts and humanities    percent in life sciences and   percent in social sciences and psychology </paragraph>
    <paragraph> schools throughout europe  asia and australia have made huge investments in graduation education in general more specifically  business school   james wimbush  dean of indiana university s kelley school of business  told the journal </paragraph>
    <paragraph>test taking data from the graduate management admissions council  gmac  supports the findings of the council of graduate schools  gmac  which owns the graduate management admissions test  gmat  entrance exam for business school programs  reports that it sent less that    percent of its scores to u s  schools in test year       which ended last june     compared with    percent in test year       over the same period  the total number of exam scores sent grew from         to          furthermore  non u s  citizens taking the gmat outnumbered u s  citizens for the first time ever in test year       and again in test year      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>the journal report also noted that u s  schools have slipped in some rankings recently  in the financial times s most recent rankings of global mba programs  for example  american schools held    of the top    spots in       down from    in      </paragraph>
    <paragraph>several factors are at play in the sluggish international application rates at u s  schools  according to julia tyler  an executive vice president at gmac  there are an increasing number of programs available worldwide  and more test takers from india  western europe and elsewhere are opting to attend programs in their home countries or regions  she says </paragraph>

  <title>how to assign an appropriate role to rankings in the mba admissions process</title>
  <text>
    <paragraph>clear admit co founder graham richmond was recently featured in an article by bloomberg businessweek focusing on the role of rankings in the mba application process  in his interview with bbw  richmond advised prospective applicants that rankings can indeed play a valuable role in the school selection process  but that it s a role that has its limits </paragraph>
    <paragraph> the rankings are an initial step  but you have to go further   richmond told bbw   the ranking doesn t tell you the full story of what life is like on that campus or what a school is actually doing to place students in a particular industry   he continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>it was for precisely this reason that clear admit launched its line of school guides  in depth profiles of each of the top mba programs  complete with program and curriculum specifics  admissions requirements and tips  career placement statistics and interviews with students and alumni to help reveal a given school s culture and community  </paragraph>
    <paragraph>rankings can provide a valuable starting point  especially if candidates use the data they contain to create a personalized list of programs that meet some of their individual criteria  richmond told bbw  candidates can even input the data into a spreadsheet and include the items most important from each  he offered  richmond told bbw that he considers the bloomberg businessweek  u s  news and financial times rankings the most respected in the industry </paragraph>
    <paragraph>after creating their own list of programs  applicants can then layer in information from the specialty rankings that many media outlets produce to focus specifically on how given schools measure up with regard to their particular career goals </paragraph>
    <paragraph>with this foundation  candidates are then well prepared to begin more thorough research into each program  including reviewing detailed guides to the school  visiting the campus and talking to current students  faculty and alumni </paragraph>
    <paragraph>admissions directors and deans from several top mba programs also contributed to the bbw article  sharing richmond s view that rankings should play a limited role in the overall process  </paragraph>
    <paragraph> use rankings to figure out where to apply   sara neher  assistant dean for mba admissions at the university of virginia s darden school of business  told bbw   don t use them to decide where to go   she continued </paragraph>
    <paragraph>judy d  olian  dean of the ucla anderson school of management  also stressed the importance of conducting significant research beyond the rankings   the rankings should be a factor but a small factor   she told bbw </paragraph>
    <paragraph>whatever you do  do not discuss the rankings in your applications  richmond stresses  admissions committees want to see that you have done your research and really see their school as a place where you can see yourself enrolled  not that you are applying simply because the school is no    on a certain publication s annual list </paragraph>
